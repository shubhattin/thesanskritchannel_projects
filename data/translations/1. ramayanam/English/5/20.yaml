  Now begins the twentieth chapter, called “The Petition of Love,” in the
  Sundara Kāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Seeing her—surrounded (by the rākṣasī guards), miserable, without joy, and
  living like an ascetic woman—Rāvaṇa addressed her with words that were
  expressive and sweet in tone.
'2': >-
  “O woman of lovely nose and thighs like the elephant’s trunk—when you behold
  me, hiding your breasts and belly, you wish, out of fear, to make yourself as
  though you were unseen.
'3': >-
  I desire you, O large-eyed one; think much of me, my beloved—O you endowed
  with every limb’s excellence, enchantress of the minds of all the worlds.
'4': >-
  Here there are no mere human beings; these rākṣasas can assume forms at will.
  Let your fear arising from me, O Sītā, depart.
'5': >-
  For the rākṣasas, O timid one, this is their own constant custom—there is no
  doubt of it: to approach other men’s wives, or to seize them by force and
  carry them away.
'6': >-
  Yet even thus, though you are unwilling, O Maithilī, I will not touch you. Let
  desire within my body act as it may, according to its own will.
'7': >-
  O goddess, do not be afraid of me; trust me, my beloved. Show true affection,
  and do not become one who longs only for sorrow.
'8': >-
  A single braid, lying on the ground, meditation, soiled garments, and fasting
  even out of season—these things are not fitting for you.
'9': >-
  Garlands of many kinds, sandal and aloe-wood perfumes, garments of diverse
  sorts, heavenly ornaments as well—
'10': >-
  and costly drinks, beds, and seats, together with song, dance, and
  instrumental music—attain all these, O Maithilī, by coming to me.
'11': >-
  You are a jewel among women—do not be thus. Put ornaments upon your limbs.
  Having come to me, how could you, of such perfect form, be unworthy of
  enjoyment?
'12': >-
  This lovely youthfulness of yours is passing swiftly; what has passed does not
  return again, like the current of flowing rivers.
'13': >-
  Having fashioned you, I think the Maker of forms—Viśvakṛt—ceased his work;
  for, O auspicious-looking one, there exists no other comparison in beauty for
  you.
'14': >-
  Having attained you, O Vaidehī, possessed of beauty and youth—who indeed would
  not overstep propriety, even if he were Brahmā himself standing before him?
'15': >-
  Whatever limb of yours I behold, O you whose face is like the cool-rayed moon,
  O broad-hipped one—upon that, upon that, my gaze is fastened.
'16': >-
  Become my wife, O Maithilī; cast away this delusion. Among many excellent
  women, become my foremost queen.
'17': >-
  Whatever jewels I have seized and brought from the worlds—those all, O timid
  one, I give to you, and my kingdom too I bestow upon you.
'18': >-
  Having conquered the entire earth, adorned with garlands of various cities, I
  shall present it to Janaka for your sake, O charming woman.
'19': >-
  In this world I see none other who could be my equal in strength. Behold my
  very great prowess—without a rival in battle.
'20': >-
  Many times in war have the gods and asuras been shattered by me, their banners
  crushed; powerless, they cannot stand against my armies.
'21': >-
  Desire me; let your excellent adornment be done today. Let bright ornaments
  indeed be fitted upon your body.
'22': >-
  I deem your beauty well suited to such adornment; adorned with finery, and
  graced with courtesy, O fair-faced one, you will shine.
'23': >-
  Enjoy pleasures as you wish; drink, O timid one; delight yourself. And bestow,
  according to your desire, the earth itself or riches.
'24': >-
  Sport with me in full confidence; command boldly as well. Let your kinsmen
  rejoice with the ladies (of the palace) from my mansions.
'25': >-
  Behold my prosperity—my royal splendor, O auspicious and illustrious one. What
  will you do with Rāma, O fortunate lady, who wears bark-garments?
'26': >-
  Rāma’s victory has been cast away; his fortune has departed; he wanders in the
  forest—keeping vows, sleeping on the bare ground. I even suspect whether he
  lives or not.
'27': >-
  Nor, O Vaidehī, is Rāma able even to obtain sight of you—like moonlight
  covered over by dark masses of clouds that move before it.
'28': >-
  And Rāghava is not fit to win you from my hand—just as Hiraṇyakaśipu could not
  recover glory once it had come into Indra’s hand.
'29': >-
  O you of charming smile, charming teeth, charming eyes, O graceful one—O timid
  lady, you steal my mind, as Suparṇa (Garuḍa) steals a serpent.
'30': >-
  Seeing you—clad in worn silk, slender though unadorned—I find no delight in my
  own wives.
'31': >-
  All the women dwelling in my inner apartments, possessed of every excellence—O
  Jānakī, make all of them your attendants, holding authority over them.
'32': >-
  Indeed, O you whose hair is dark at the ends, the foremost women of the three
  worlds—those shall wait upon you, as apsarases wait upon royal splendor.
'33': >-
  The jewels and wealth that belong to Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera)—those, and the worlds
  as well, O fair-browed, O fair-hipped one—enjoy them through me at your ease.
'34': >-
  Rāma, O goddess, is not equal to me in austerity, nor in strength and heroic
  might, nor in wealth—nor in splendor or in fame.
'35': >-
  Drink, wander in pleasure, rejoice; enjoy delights. I grant you heaps of
  riches and the earth as well. Sport with me, O lady, wholly at your ease—and
  let your kinsmen, having joined you, revel likewise.
'36': >-
  In groves spread with clusters of flowering trees, filled with bees, born on
  the seashore—O timid one, with limbs adorned by pure golden necklaces—wander
  with me through the forests.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the twentieth chapter, named “The Petition of Love,” in the Sundara
  Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
