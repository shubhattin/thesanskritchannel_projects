  Now begins the Fifty-eighth Sarga of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Recounting of Hanumān’s Deeds.”
'1': >-
  Then, upon the peak of that great Mahendra mountain, those mighty
  monkeys—Hanumān at their head—attained the highest joy and satisfaction.
'2': >-
  When those great-souled vānaras had sat down, filled with gladness, Jāmbavān,
  himself greatly delighted, addressed that great monkey Hanumān who was still
  rejoicing.
'3': >-
  Jāmbavān asked Anila’s son (Hanumān) about the entire course of the
  undertaking: “How did you behold the Divine Lady, and in what condition does
  she dwell there?”
'4': >-
  “And there—how did the cruel-doer Daśānana (Rāvaṇa) conduct himself toward
  her? O great monkey, tell us all this truly, as it is.”
'5': >-
  “How was the Lady sought out, and what did she reply? Having heard the matter,
  we shall again deliberate and determine the further course of action.”
'6': >-
  “And whatever message is to be spoken there by us who have arrived, O
  self-possessed one—and whatever needs to be safeguarded there—let that also be
  clearly set forth by you for us.”
'7': >-
  Thus commissioned by him, with the hairs on his body thrilled in joy, Hanumān,
  bowing his head in reverence to the Lady Sītā, spoke in reply.
'8': >-
  “In your very presence—having leapt into the sky from the summit of
  Mahendra—intent and composed, I set my heart upon reaching the southern shore
  of the ocean.”
'9': >-
  “And as I went, there appeared to me, as it were, a dreadful obstacle taking
  the form of a hindrance: I beheld a golden, divine, exceedingly delightful
  peak.”
'10': >-
  “Standing there and covering the path, I deemed that mountain to be an
  obstacle. Drawing near to that divine and excellent golden mountain,”
'11': >-
  “I resolved in my mind and understanding: ‘This must be broken by me.’ When I
  struck that great mountain with my tail,”
'12': >-
  “its summit, radiant like the sun, shattered into a thousand pieces. Knowing
  my firm resolve, that great mountain spoke.”
'13': >-
  “Calling out ‘Son!’ in a sweet voice, as though gladdening my heart: ‘Know me
  as your paternal uncle, and as a friend of Mātariśvan (the Wind),’”
'14': >-
  “‘I am renowned as Maināka, dwelling in the great ocean. Formerly, O son, the
  foremost mountains had wings.’”
'15': >-
  “‘At will they ranged over the earth, harassing it on every side. Hearing of
  the mountains’ behavior, Mahendra, the chastiser of Pāka (Indra),’”
'16': >-
  “‘the Blessed One, cut off their wings by his thunderbolt—by the thousands.
  But I was rescued from that fate by your great-souled father.’”
'17': >-
  “‘Then, O child, by Māruta I was cast into Varuṇa’s abode (the ocean). You,
  the subduer of foes, must render aid to Rāghava.’”
'18': >-
  “‘Rāma, the best among uphold ers of dharma, is equal in prowess to Mahendra.’
  Having heard these words of the great-souled Maināka,”
'19': >-
  “and having made known my mission, my mind grew proud and eager; and by that
  great-souled Maināka I was granted permission to proceed.”
'20': >-
  “And that mountain too vanished—assuming a human form; the great mountain with
  his body, and with his mountain-form within the great ocean.”
'21': >-
  “Taking up excellent speed, I resumed the remaining stretch of the way; and
  for a long time I sped along the path with great swiftness.”
'22': >-
  “Then I beheld the goddess Surasā, mother of the Nāgas. In the midst of the
  ocean that goddess spoke to me these words:”
'23': >-
  “‘O best of monkeys, you have been appointed to me as food by the immortals.
  Therefore I shall devour you, for you are ordained for me by the gods.’”
'24': >-
  “Thus addressed by Surasā, I stood with joined palms, bowed in reverence; and
  my face turned pale, and I uttered these words:”
'25': >-
  “‘The illustrious Rāma, son of Daśaratha, has entered the Daṇḍaka
  forest—together with his brother Lakṣmaṇa, and with Sītā—he, the scorcher of
  foes.’”
'26': >-
  “‘His wife Sītā has been carried off by the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa. As a
  messenger, by Rāma’s command, I shall go to her presence.’”
'27': >-
  “‘It is fitting for you, O virtuous one, to render aid to Rāma in this matter.
  Or else—having seen Maithilī and having reported to Rāma of unwearied deeds—’”
'28': >-
  “‘I shall return to your mouth; truly do I promise you.’ Thus spoken to by me,
  that Surasā, who could assume any form at will,”
'29': >-
  “said: ‘Let no one pass me by—this is my boon.’ Thus addressed by Surasā, I
  became ten yojanas in length,”
'30': >-
  “and in an instant I grew to half again as much in breadth. And her mouth too
  yawned open, larger than my measure.”
'31': >-
  “Seeing her mouth wide open, I again made myself small; and in that very
  moment I became but the size of a thumb.”
'32': >-
  “Quickly darting into that mouth, I came out of it in an instant. Then the
  goddess Surasā spoke to me again, in her own form:”
'33': >-
  “‘For the success of your purpose, O best of monkeys, go, gentle one, as you
  please; and bring Vaidehī to the great-souled Rāghava.’”
'34': >-
  “‘Be happy, mighty-armed one; I am pleased with you, O monkey.’ Then I was
  praised by all beings as ‘Well done! Well done!’”
'35': >-
  “Then I leapt through the vast mid-air like Garuḍa. And my shadow was seized,
  and I could see nothing at all.”
'36': >-
  “Having thus lost my speed, I looked around in all ten directions, yet I saw
  nothing there by which my course had been obstructed.”
'37': >-
  “Then a thought arose in me: ‘What is this in my going? Such an obstacle has
  arisen, but its form is not seen here.’”
'38': >-
  “Then my downcast gaze, in my distress, fell below; there I saw a terrible
  rākṣasī, Siṃhikā, lying in the waters.”
'39': >-
  “Laughing, and uttering a great roar, that dreadful one spoke to me—who stood
  firm, unconfounded—these unbecoming words:”
'40': >-
  “‘Where are you going, huge-bodied one—desired by me, hungry as I am? Be my
  food; satisfy my body, long deprived of sustenance!’”
'41': >-
  “Then I accepted her speech, saying only ‘So be it!’ and I filled out my body
  larger than the measure of her mouth.”
'42': >-
  “And her vast, fearsome mouth expanded for the sake of devouring me; yet she
  did not perceive me, nor the change I had wrought.”
'43': >-
  “Then, in the interval of a blink, I contracted my huge form, tore out her
  heart, and sprang up into the vault of the sky.”
'44': >-
  “That dreadful one fell into the salt waters with arms flung out—she who was
  mountain-like, her heart cut away by me.”
'45': >-
  “I heard the pleasant words of great-souled beings moving through the sky:
  ‘The dreadful rākṣasī Siṃhikā has been swiftly slain by Hanumān!’”
'46': >-
  “Having slain her, I again remembered my urgent duty; and after going a great
  distance, I beheld a land adorned with mountains.”
'47': >-
  “It was the southern shore of the ocean, where the city of Laṅkā stands—an
  abode of rākṣasas—when the sun had set.”
'48': >-
  “I entered, unknown to the rākṣasas of terrible prowess. And as I entered
  there, I saw a woman,”
'49': >-
  “dark as a cloud at the end of an age, who rose up before me, releasing a
  loud, harsh laugh—her hair like blazing fire—as though wishing to slay me.”
'50': >-
  “With a blow of my left fist I overcame that exceedingly dreadful one. Then,
  at twilight, I entered, my fear dispelled by her words.”
'51': >-
  “‘Hero, I—Laṅkā-city—have been conquered by your valor. Therefore you shall
  conquer all the rākṣasas without remainder.’”
'52': >-
  “There I wandered all through the night, seeking the daughter of Janaka; yet,
  though I went into Rāvaṇa’s inner apartments, I did not see that
  slender-waisted one.”
'53': >-
  “Then, not finding Sītā in Rāvaṇa’s residence, I fell into an ocean of sorrow
  and could not perceive its far shore.”
'54': >-
  “And as I grieved, I saw, enclosed by a rampart, an excellent
  house-garden—surrounded by drawn-out golden fencing.”
'55': >-
  “Leaping over that rampart, I beheld many trees. In the midst of the Aśoka
  grove stood a great śiṃśapā tree.”
'56': >-
  “Climbing it, I saw a golden grove of plantains; and not far from that śiṃśapā
  tree, I beheld a lady of peerless beauty.”
'57': >-
  “Dark-hued, lotus-petal-eyed, her face made thin by fasting; clad in a single
  garment, her hair dust-soiled and disheveled,”
'58': >-
  “Sītā—her limbs wasted by sorrow and burning anguish—steadfast in her
  husband’s welfare, surrounded by hideous and cruel rākṣasīs.”
'59': >-
  “Like a doe among tigresses—flesh-and-blood-eating—she was there among the
  rākṣasīs, threatened again and again before my eyes.”
'60': >-
  “Wearing her hair in a single braid, wretched, absorbed in thoughts of her
  husband; lying on the ground, her body pale—like a lotus-pond in the season of
  frost.”
'61': >-
  “Turning away from Rāvaṇa’s desires, resolved upon death, that fawn-eyed one
  was, with great difficulty, quickly reached by me.”
'62': >-
  “Seeing that lady in such a state—Rāma’s famed wife—I remained there in the
  śiṃśapā tree, watching.”
'63': >-
  “Then I heard, in Rāvaṇa’s residence, a very deep sound—‘halahala’—mingled
  with the jingling of girdles and anklets.”
'64': >-
  “Then, exceedingly anxious, I drew in my own form and stayed hidden in the
  dense foliage of the śiṃśapā tree like a bird.”
'65': >-
  “Then Rāvaṇa’s wives, and Rāvaṇa himself of great might, came to that place
  where Sītā stood.”
'66': >-
  “Seeing the lord of the rākṣasa host, that fair-hipped Sītā drew in her
  thighs, embraced her full breasts with her arms,”
'67': >-
  “and, terrified and greatly distressed, looking this way and that, seeing no
  refuge anywhere, trembling—she, the chaste ascetic-like lady.”
'68': >-
  “To that deeply sorrowing Sītā, Daśagrīva spoke: ‘Fallen with head bent low,
  do you not honor me? Show me regard!’”
'69': >-
  “‘If, proud woman, you do not welcome me out of arrogance, then after two
  months, O Sītā, I shall drink your blood!’”
'70': >-
  “Hearing those words of the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, Sītā, in supreme anger,
  spoke an excellent reply.”
'71': >-
  “‘O vilest of rākṣasas! I am the wife of Rāma of immeasurable splendor,
  daughter-in-law of Daśaratha, and bride of the lord of the Ikṣvāku race!’”
'72': >-
  “‘How has your tongue not fallen out, when you speak what should not be
  spoken? What valor is yours, O ignoble one, that you carried me off in my
  husband’s absence,’”
'73': >-
  “‘and came here, sinful wretch, unseen by that great-souled one? You are not
  equal to Rāma; you are not fit even to be his slave!’”
'74': >-
  “Rāghava is unconquerable, truthful in speech, a hero, and famed for battle.
  Thus addressed harshly by Jānakī, Daśānana”
'75': >-
  “suddenly flared up with anger like fire upon a funeral pyre; he opened wide
  his cruel eyes and raised his right fist.”
'76': >-
  “He began to strike Maithilī; then the women cried out ‘Alas! Alas!’ At that
  moment, from among the women, his wife”
'77': >-
  “—the excellent Mandodarī by name—leapt up and restrained him, speaking sweet
  words to him, as he was tormented by desire.”
'78': >-
  “‘What need have you of Sītā, O you whose prowess equals Indra’s? Sport today
  with me; Jānakī is not superior to me.’”
'79': >-
  “‘Sport, O lord, together with celestial nymphs, Gandharva maidens, and Yakṣa
  maidens. What will you do with Sītā?’”
'80': >-
  “Then, accompanied by those assembled women, that mighty night-ranger was
  abruptly lifted up and led away to his own palace.”
'81': >-
  “When Daśagrīva had gone, those rākṣasīs with misshapen faces began to revile
  Sītā with cruel and most dreadful words.”
'82': >-
  “Jānakī regarded their speech as mere straw; and their roaring, after reaching
  Sītā, was likewise pointless.”
'83': >-
  “Those flesh-eating rākṣasīs, exhausted and futile in their roaring, reported
  to Rāvaṇa Sītā’s great resolve.”
'84': >-
  “Then all of them together, their hopes dashed and their efforts spent, became
  weary; and, one and all, they came under the power of sleep.”
'85': >-
  “When they had fallen asleep, Sītā—devoted to her husband’s good—lamented
  piteously, wretched, and grieved exceedingly.”
'86': >-
  “Then, rising from among them, Trijaṭā spoke these words: ‘Devour yourselves
  quickly, not Sītā of dark eyes!’”
'87': >-
  “‘She is Janaka’s virtuous daughter, and Daśaratha’s daughter-in-law. For
  today I have seen a dreadful dream, making the hair stand on end.’”
'88': >-
  “‘It forebodes the destruction of the rākṣasas and the victory of her lord.
  Rāghava is enough to protect us rākṣasa-women from that great fear.’”
'89': >-
  “‘Let us supplicate Vaidehī—this is what pleases me; for if such a dream
  appears to one who is afflicted,’”
'90': >-
  “‘she becomes released from many sorrows and attains unsurpassed happiness.
  Indeed Maithilī, Janaka’s daughter, is gracious when bowed to.’”
'91': >-
  “‘She is enough to protect the rākṣasīs from a great terror.’ Then that modest
  young woman, gladdened by her lord’s victory,”
'92': >-
  “said: ‘If that is true, I shall indeed be your refuge.’ Seeing Sītā in that
  dreadful condition,”
'93': >-
  “I pondered, having rested, yet my mind found no peace. And I devised the
  means to speak with Jānakī.”
'94': >-
  “First, I recited in her presence the praises of the Ikṣvāku dynasty. Hearing
  that speech—adorned with the assembly of royal seers—”
'95': >-
  “the Lady replied to me, her eyes veiled with tears: ‘Who are you, and how,
  and by whom, have you come here, O foremost of monkeys?’”
'96': >-
  “‘And what affection have you for Rāma? That you should tell me.’ Hearing her
  words, I too spoke in reply:”
'97': >-
  “‘O Goddess, your lord Rāma’s ally is the valiant Sugrīva, of terrible
  prowess—the mighty king of the monkeys.’”
'98': >-
  “‘Know me as his servant—Hanumān—who has come here, sent to you by your
  husband Rāma of unwearied action.’”
'99': >-
  “‘And this—given by the illustrious tiger among men, Daśarathi himself—is his
  signet-ring, a token of recognition, O renowned lady, for you.’”
'100': >-
  “‘Now I desire to be commanded by you, O Goddess—what shall I do? Shall I
  carry you to the side of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa? What is your decision?’”
'101': >-
  “Hearing this and understanding, Sītā, Janaka’s daughter, said: ‘Let Rāghava
  tear out Rāvaṇa and take me away.’”
'102': >-
  “Bowing my head to the noble, blameless Lady, I requested from her a token of
  recognition that would gladden Rāghava’s heart.”
'103': >-
  “Then Sītā said to me: ‘Let this excellent jewel be taken—by which
  mighty-armed Rāma holds you in high regard.’”
'104': >-
  “So saying, that fair-hipped lady, exceedingly anxious, gave me that supreme
  and choice jewel, and gave me further instruction in words.”
'105': >-
  “Then, having bowed to that princess, composed, I circumambulated her in
  reverence, my mind uplifted.”
'106': >-
  “Then again, having decided upon the answer in her mind, she said: ‘Hanumān,
  you must relate my condition to Rāghava.’”
'107': >-
  “‘So act that, as soon as he hears, those two heroes—Rāma and
  Lakṣmaṇa—together with Sugrīva, may come here.’”
'108': >-
  “‘If it be otherwise than this, my life is but two months. The Kakutstha will
  not see me; like one without refuge, I shall die.’”
'109': >-
  “Hearing those compassionate words, wrath overcame me; and I perceived the
  remaining work that had to be done next.”
'110': >-
  “Then my body grew vast, like a mountain; desiring battle, I began to destroy
  that grove.”
'111': >-
  “That broken section of forest, with deer and birds wandering in terror and
  confusion—seeing it, the rākṣasīs with distorted faces awoke and looked
  about.”
'112': >-
  “And seeing me in that grove, they gathered from here and there; and they
  quickly went and reported to Rāvaṇa.”
'113': >-
  “‘O King, this impregnable forest of yours has been destroyed by a wicked
  one—a monkey—who has not understood your might, O great-armed one!’”
'114': >-
  “‘That ill-minded one, O King, who has done you harm—order his death at once,
  so that he may not depart again!’”
'115': >-
  “Hearing that, the lord of the rākṣasas dispatched many hard-to-conquer
  rākṣasas called Kiṅkaras, obedient to Rāvaṇa’s will.”
'116': >-
  “Eighty thousand of them, bearing spears and maces in their hands, were slain
  by me in that grove-region with an iron bar.”
'117': >-
  “Those who remained after the slaughter, swift of movement, went and reported
  to Rāvaṇa that his forces had been destroyed by me.”
'118': >-
  “Then the thought arose in me to destroy the excellent sacred gateway-tower;
  there I slew another hundred rākṣasas with a pillar.”
'119': >-
  “That crowning ornament of Laṅkā was, in wrath, demolished by me. Then he
  commanded Prahasta’s son Jambumālī,”
'120': >-
  “together with many rākṣasas of dreadful and fearsome forms. That powerful
  rākṣasa, skilled in battle,”
'121': >-
  “I slew with a most terrible iron bar, along with his followers. Hearing that,
  the rākṣasa-king dispatched the mighty sons of his ministers,”
'122': >-
  “strong with infantry force; and with the iron bar I sent them all to Yama’s
  abode.”
'123': >-
  “Hearing that the ministers’ sons—of quick valor—had been slain in battle,
  Rāvaṇa dispatched five heroic commanders of the army’s van,”
'124': >-
  “and I killed them all, along with their troops. Then again Daśagrīva sent his
  mighty son Akṣa,”
'125': >-
  “to battle, together with many rākṣasas. That son of Mandodarī, a prince
  trained in war,”
'126': >-
  “springing into the sky, I suddenly seized by the feet; and whirling him a
  hundredfold, I dashed him down and killed him.”
'127': >-
  “Hearing that Akṣa had come and been destroyed, that Daśānana, greatly
  enraged, then commanded his second son named Indrajit,”
'128': >-
  “mighty and arrogant with the fury of battle. And I too, having shattered all
  his forces and that foremost of rākṣasas,”
'129': >-
  “leaving him bereft of prowess in the fight, attained the highest
  exhilaration—though he was mighty-armed and powerful, and fought with great
  skill and confidence.”
'130': >-
  “He had been sent by Rāvaṇa along with heroes intoxicated with pride. Knowing
  me to be unendurable and his army crushed,”
'131': >-
  “he bound me with Brahmā’s weapon; then the rākṣasas also bound me there with
  ropes.”
'132': >-
  “They took me near to Rāvaṇa. I was seen and spoken to by that wicked-souled
  Rāvaṇa.”
'133': >-
  “He questioned me about my coming to Laṅkā and about that slaughter of the
  rākṣasas; and I told him everything there in the battle, for Sītā’s sake.”
'134': >-
  “‘Desiring to behold her, O mighty one, I have reached your abode. I am
  Hanumān, the vānara, true-born son of Māruta.’”
'135': >-
  “‘Know me as Rāma’s messenger, and as Sugrīva’s counselor, a monkey. As Rāma’s
  envoy, I have come here into your presence.’”
'136': >-
  “‘Hear also the command that I declare to you. O lord of rākṣasas, the lord of
  monkeys has spoken to you this message with composure.’”
'137': >-
  “‘And the fortunate Sugrīva inquired of your welfare, and spoke what is
  beneficial and wholesome—consistent with dharma, artha, and kāma.’”
'138': >-
  “‘While I dwelt on Ṛṣyamūka mountain, rich in spreading trees, Rāghava—valiant
  in battle—came into friendship with me.’”
'139': >-
  “‘He told me, O King: “My wife has been abducted by a rākṣasa. For the sake of
  helping me, you should make a compact with me.”’”
'140': >-
  “‘With Sugrīva—whose kingdom had been seized by Vāli—Rāghava, together with
  Lakṣmaṇa, entered into friendship witnessed by fire.’”
'141': >-
  “‘Then, slaying Vāli in battle with a single arrow, he made Sugrīva the great
  king of the monkeys, lord of those who can leap.’”
'142': >-
  “‘Therefore we must aid him in every way in this matter. Thus, in accordance
  with dharma, I have been dispatched to you and have come near.’”
'143': >-
  “‘Let Sītā be brought back quickly, and be given to Rāghava—before the heroic
  monkeys utterly shatter your forces.’”
'144': >-
  “‘This might of the monkeys has not been known to anyone before—of those who
  go, invited, even into the presence of the gods.’”
'145': >-
  “‘Thus the king of the monkeys spoke to you,’—so I declared. Then, enraged,
  Rāvaṇa looked upon me as though burning me with his eyes.”
'146': >-
  “By that rākṣasa of dreadful deeds, the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, I was ordered to
  be slain—because he did not know my power.”
'147': >-
  “Then his brother, named Vibhīṣaṇa, of great wisdom, spoke on my behalf and
  entreated the rākṣasa-king.”
'148': >-
  “‘Not so, O tiger among rākṣasas—let this resolve be abandoned; the path you
  are taking is seen to be contrary to royal policy.’”
'149': >-
  “‘In the treatises of statecraft, O rākṣasa, the slaying of a messenger is not
  enjoined; and through a messenger one should learn what is to be known, from
  one who reports as instructed.’”
'150': >-
  “‘Even when the offense is very great, O you of unrivaled valor, for a
  messenger the punishment seen is disfigurement, not death—such is the rule of
  śāstra.’”
'151': >-
  “Thus spoken to by Vibhīṣaṇa, Rāvaṇa commanded those rākṣasas: ‘Let his tail
  be burned today—this very thing!’”
'152': >-
  “Hearing his words, they wrapped my tail on every side with hempen cloth and
  also with strips of cotton fabric.”
'153': >-
  “Those rākṣasas, fully armed, of fierce prowess, then set my tail alight,
  striking it with fists and pieces of wood.”
'154': >-
  “Though bound by many nooses and restrained by the rākṣasas, I felt no
  pain—desiring to behold the city by day.”
'155': >-
  “Then those heroic rākṣasas, taking me bound and surrounded with fire,
  proclaimed it along the royal road, arriving at the city gate.”
'156': >-
  “Then I reduced my very large form again to my natural size; and having freed
  myself from those bonds, I stood once more in my normal state.”
'157': >-
  “Taking up an iron bar, I slew those rākṣasas; then I leapt with speed up to
  that city gate.”
'158': >-
  “And with my tail aflame, I burned that city with its ramparts and lofty
  gateways—unperturbed—like the fire at the end of an age burning living
  beings.”
'159': >-
  “‘Surely Jānakī is destroyed, for no spot is seen unburned; some part of Laṅkā
  does not remain—its whole city has been reduced to ashes.’”
'160': >-
  “‘And while I was burning Laṅkā, Sītā too has been burned—no doubt of it. And
  thus Rāma’s great task has been made fruitless by me.’”
'161': >-
  “Thus overwhelmed by grief, I fell into anxious thought. Then I heard the
  words of the Cāraṇas—auspicious in syllables—”
'162': >-
  “speaking the wondrous tidings: ‘Jānakī has not been burned!’ Hearing that
  marvelous utterance, my understanding awoke.”
'163': >-
  “‘Jānakī is indeed unburned’—and it was also marked by omens: though my tail
  was blazing, the fire did not burn me.”
'164': >-
  “And my heart became gladdened; the winds blew with fragrant scent. By those
  omens—clear in their meaning—and by those excellent reasons,”
'165': >-
  “and by the efficacious words of seers, my mind became joyful. And Vaidehī was
  seen again, and by her I was once more dismissed.”
'166': >-
  “Then, reaching that mountain called Ariṣṭa, I again began the return-leap,
  longing to behold you.”
'167': >-
  “Then, traversing the path frequented by Wind, Moon, Sun, Siddhas, and
  Gandharvas, I have seen you here.”
'168': >-
  “By Rāghava’s grace, and by your splendor, and for Sugrīva’s purpose, all has
  been accomplished by me.”
'169': >-
  “All this there has been carried out by me in due manner. Whatever remains
  that was not done there—let all that now be done.”
'170': >-
  Thus ends the Fifty-eighth Sarga of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Recounting of Hanumān’s Deeds.”
