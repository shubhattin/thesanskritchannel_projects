  Then, in the glorious Valmiki Ramayana, in the Yuddha-kanda, the eighty-eighth
  canto, named “The Battle of Saumitri (Lakshmana) with the Son of Ravana
  (Indrajit).”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Ravana’s son, overcome by a swoon of wrath,
  spoke harshly; and, inflamed with anger, he sprang up at once.
'2': >-
  With sword and weapons uplifted, standing upon a great and splendidly adorned
  chariot, yoked with steeds black as Death, he appeared like the very Destroyer
  at the end of time.
'3': >-
  That dreadful one, of terrible might, lifting up a vast, firm bow of great
  size and swiftness, and dread arrows that bring ruin to foes,
'4': >-
  was seen by Lakshmana, the great archer—Indrajit, mighty and well-adorned,
  seated in his chariot, the powerful son of Ravana, the slayer of enemies,
  himself richly ornamented.
'5': >-
  Then, highly enraged, he addressed Saumitri (Lakshmana), who was together with
  Vibhishana, and who was mounted upon Hanuman’s back and shone like the rising
  or the setting sun:
'6': >-
  “Behold, you tiger-like vanaras, my prowess! Today the hard-to-withstand rain
  of arrows loosed from my bow—
'7': >-
  like a cloudburst in the sky—shall you endure in battle. Today my shafts, shot
  from my mighty bow, shall crush your limbs, even as fire consumes a heap of
  cotton.”
'8': >-
  “Pierced by sharp darts, by spears, lances, javelins, and tomars, today I
  shall send you all to Yama’s abode.”
'9': >-
  “When I, swift-handed in battle, pour forth showers of arrows, like a roaring
  thundercloud, who will stand before me?”
'10': >-
  “Earlier, in the night-battle, with arrows like thunderbolts and lightning, I
  laid you two low once again—senseless—along with your leaders.”
'11': >-
  “Or perhaps you have no recollection; clearly you had gone to Yama’s
  dwelling—since, like an enraged venomous serpent, you have come forward to
  fight me.”
'12': >-
  Hearing the roar and boast of the lord of rakshasas, Raghava then—fearless of
  face though angered—spoke these words to Ravana’s son:
'13': >-
  “By you, O rakshasa, the far shore of deeds is spoken of as difficult to
  reach. But he is truly wise who reaches the far shore of action by action
  itself.”
'14': >-
  “Yet you—bereft of true purpose—by mere speech, as though attaining what is
  difficult for anyone to attain, imagine, ‘I have accomplished my aim,’ O
  evil-minded one.”
'15': >-
  “That course which you pursued in battle, moving in concealment, is the path
  followed by thieves; it is not a path resorted to by heroes.”
'16': >-
  “Now that I have come within the range of your arrows, O rakshasa, show today
  that splendor of yours. Why do you prattle with words?”
'17': >-
  Thus addressed, Indrajit, conqueror of hosts, grasping his dreadful bow, that
  mighty one let fly sharp arrows.
'18': >-
  Those shafts, discharged with great speed, like serpent-venom in their
  potency, reached Lakshmana and fell upon him, hissing like living snakes.
'19': >-
  With exceedingly swift arrows, Indrajit, the son of Ravana, wounded Saumitri
  in battle—Lakshmana of auspicious marks.
'20': >-
  His limbs pierced deeply by arrows and drenched in blood, the illustrious
  Lakshmana shone, like fire without smoke.
'21': >-
  Indrajit, beholding his own feat, approached, and roaring a very great cry,
  spoke these words:
'22': >-
  “These sharp-pointed, feathered arrows of mine, shot from my bow—dealers of
  life’s end—shall today take away your life, O Saumitri!”
'23': >-
  “Today, O Lakshmana, may packs of jackals and flocks of hawks, and vultures
  too, swoop down upon you—lifeless—slain by me!”
'24': >-
  “Rama, that utterly misguided one—base-born in kshatriya guise and ever
  unmanly—shall today see you, his devoted brother, slain by me!”
'25': >-
  “With your armor fallen away upon the ground, your bow cast aside, your head
  cut off—O Saumitri—today you shall be slain by me!”
'26': >-
  As he spoke thus—angry and harsh—Ravana’s son, Lakshmana, knower of the truth
  of matters, replied to him with words that were reasoned and meaningful:
'27': >-
  “Abandon this strength of speech, O evil-witted one—O rakshasa of cruel deeds.
  Why do you say such things? Accomplish it by noble action.”
'28': >-
  “Without performing the deed, you boast—why, O rakshasa? Do that deed by which
  I may deem your boasting worthy of belief.”
'29': >-
  “Without uttering harsh words, without casting any blame at all, without
  boasting, I shall slay you—behold, O devourer of men!”
'30': >-
  Saying so, Lakshmana, with great speed, struck the rakshasa’s chest with five
  Naracha arrows, drawn to the ear.
'31': >-
  Those well-feathered arrows, hissing as though blazing serpents, shone upon
  the rakshasa’s breast like the rays of the sun.
'32': >-
  Struck by his arrows, Ravana’s son, filled with fury, with three well-aimed
  shafts, in turn pierced Lakshmana.
'33': >-
  Then there arose a most terrible, tumultuous struggle in battle between that
  lion among men and that lion among rakshasas—each seeking victory over the
  other.
'34': >-
  Both were bold and endowed with strength; both were rich in valor; both were
  exceedingly hard to conquer, of unmatched might and splendor.
'35': >-
  Those two heroes fought then like two planets moving in the heavens; indeed,
  in battle they were difficult to assail, like mighty Vritra and the powerful
  one (Indra).
'36': >-
  Those great-souled ones fought then like two lions, ceaselessly releasing
  torrents of arrows without pause; those foremost of man and rakshasa,
  exultant, strove against each other in combat.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-eighth canto, named “The Battle of Saumitri with the Son
  of Ravana,” in the Yuddha-kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the Adi-kavya.
