  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the second
  chapter, called “The Encouragement of Rāma.”
'1': >-
  To that Rāma—the son of Daśaratha—who was bowed down with grief and sunk in
  sorrow, the illustrious Sugrīva spoke words that dispel lamentation.
'2': >-
  Why, O hero, do you torment yourself as though you were some other ordinary
  man? Do not be so; abandon this burning anguish, and do not cast aside
  friendship as though you were ungrateful.
'3': >-
  I do not see, O Rāghava, any rightful ground for your grief—since action has
  already been set in motion and the abode of the foe has been discovered and
  known.
'4': >-
  You are discerning, learned in the śāstras, wise, and indeed a man of sound
  judgment, O Rāghava. Cast off this common, worldly way of thinking,
  which—though one may deem oneself self-controlled—only spoils one’s purpose.
'5': >-
  Having crossed the ocean that teems with mighty crocodiles, we shall ascend to
  Laṅkā and we shall slay your enemy.
'6': >-
  For one who is without enthusiasm, dejected, and whose mind is bewildered by
  sorrow, all aims collapse; and he falls into calamity.
'7': >-
  These heroes—the leaders of the monkey hosts—are capable and strong on every
  side. For the sake of what is dear to you, they are eager enough even to enter
  fire. From their very joy I know this, and my reasoning too is firm.
'8': >-
  By valour I shall bring Sītā back, having slain the enemy, just as it should
  be. In the same manner, you ought to act toward Rāvaṇa, that doer of sinful
  deeds.
'9': >-
  How a causeway may be built here, and how we may behold that city—so must you
  act, O Rāghava, toward that king of rākṣasas.
'10': >-
  Having seen that city of Laṅkā, standing upon the peak of Trikūṭa, know with
  certainty—by that very sight—that Rāvaṇa shall be slain in battle.
'11': >-
  Without first binding a bridge across the ocean—terrible, the abode of
  Varuṇa—Laṅkā cannot be crushed, even by gods and asuras together, even with
  Indra among them.
'12': >-
  When the bridge across the ocean is built as far as the vicinity of Laṅkā, and
  when my entire army has crossed over—then understand it as victory already
  won. For these vīras, the monkeys in battle, can assume forms at will.
'13': >-
  Therefore, enough of this wavering thought, O king, which brings ruin to every
  undertaking. In this world, grief in a man diminishes heroism.
'14': >-
  But whatever task a man must do, let him take hold of boldness and prowess;
  for that itself quickly becomes the very adornment of the doer—his true
  distinction.
'15': >-
  At this time, O greatly wise one, take your stand in courage with your
  splendour. For heroic men like you, great-souled as you are—whether something
  is destroyed or lost—grief is the destroyer of all aims.
'16': >-
  You are the foremost among the intelligent, truly knowing the meanings and
  purport of all śāstras. Along with counsellors such as me, you are worthy and
  able to conquer the foe.
'17': >-
  For I do not see anyone at all in the three worlds, O Rāghava, who could stand
  facing you in battle when you have taken up your bow.
'18': >-
  With the vānaras devoted to you, your undertaking will not fail. Before long
  you shall see Sītā, having crossed the ocean that is inexhaustible.
'19': >-
  Therefore, abandon your clinging to grief; take hold of wrath, O lord of the
  earth. Even dull and helpless kṣatriyas—being inactive—fear the fierce man.
'20': >-
  For the purpose of crossing this dreadful ocean, lord of rivers, come together
  here with us and reflect with subtle intelligence.
'21': >-
  Once those armies have crossed there, conclude it as victory indeed. When my
  entire army has crossed over, let it be firmly understood as victory won.
'22': >-
  For these monkeys are heroic, and in battle they can assume forms at will.
  They will rout those enemies with showers of rocks and trees.
'23': >-
  Somehow I foresee that the abode of Varuṇa has been crossed; and I deem him as
  good as slain in battle, O you who crush your foes.
'24': >-
  Why should I speak at length in many ways? In every respect you are
  victorious. I also see favourable omens, and my mind is filled with delight.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the second chapter, called “The Encouragement of Rāma,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the holy, ancient epic.
