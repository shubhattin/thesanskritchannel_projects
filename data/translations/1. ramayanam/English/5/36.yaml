  Then, in the holy, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa, the
  thirty-sixth chapter called “The Presentation of the Ring.”
'1': >-
  Then again Hanūmān, the high-souled son of the Wind-god, of great radiance,
  spoke to Sītā in humble words, for the sake of giving her assurance and
  conviction.
'2': >-
  “O most fortunate lady, I am a vanara, the envoy of wise Rāma. Behold, O
  goddess, this ring marked with Rāma’s name.”
'3': >-
  “It has been brought for you as a token of recognition; it was given by that
  great-souled one. Take comfort—blessing be upon you—for you are one whose
  fruits of sorrow are coming to an end.”
'4': >-
  Receiving it, she gazed upon that ornament which adorned her husband’s hand;
  and Jānakī became glad, as though her lord himself had come into her presence.
'5': >-
  Her lovely face, with eyes tinged reddish-white, grew radiant with rising
  joy—like the moon released from Rāhu.
'6': >-
  Then that modest young lady, delighted by the tidings from her husband,
  satisfied in heart, and having done what was pleasing, praised the great
  monkey.
'7': >-
  “You are valiant; you are capable; you are wise, O foremost of vanaras—since
  by you alone this abode of rākṣasas has been assailed and shaken.”
'8': >-
  “The ocean, the home of makaras, spread a hundred yojanas across, has been
  reduced to the measure of a cow’s hoofprint by you as you crossed it with
  praiseworthy prowess.”
'9': >-
  “Indeed I do not think you an ordinary vanara, O bull among vanaras—since you
  have no fear, no agitation, even of Rāvaṇa.”
'10': >-
  “And I may fittingly speak with you, O best of monkeys, if you have truly been
  sent by Rāma, whose self is well-known and well-understood.”
'11': >-
  “The unassailable Rāma would not send one untested—especially to me—without
  having ascertained his valor and knowing his might.”
'12': >-
  “By good fortune, is righteous Rāma well, he whose vows in battle are true;
  and is mighty Lakṣmaṇa also well, the increaser of Sumitrā’s joy?”
'13': >-
  “If the son of Kakutstha is well, why does he not burn, in wrath, the earth
  girdled by the ocean—like the fire of the end of the age arisen?”
'14': >-
  “Or else—since those two are powerful enough even to subdue the gods—surely, I
  think, the reversal of my sufferings is not far away.”
'15': >-
  “Is Rāma not distressed? Is he not tormented? Does that best of men carry on
  the tasks that must yet be done?”
'16': >-
  “Is he not dejected, not bewildered, and does he not falter in his
  undertakings? Does the prince perform the efforts proper to a man?”
'17': >-
  “Does he employ the means—twofold and threefold—when seeking conquest? Does
  that scorcher of foes act rightly among allies and friends?”
'18': >-
  “Does he gain friends, and is he not approached by enemies? Is he a friend of
  good men, and is he also honored and supported by his friends?”
'19': >-
  “Does the king’s son seek the grace of the gods? Does he also rely upon human
  endeavor as well as upon destiny?”
'20': >-
  “Has Rāghava not lost his affection for me because of my long absence? Will
  Rāghava deliver me from this calamity?”
'21': >-
  “Rāma is ever fit for happiness and not fit for misery; having met this later
  sorrow, does Rāma not sink down in dejection?”
'22': >-
  “And is good health constantly heard of—of Kausalyā, and likewise of Sumitrā,
  and also of Bharata?”
'23': >-
  “Because of me, is Rāghava—worthy of honor—overwhelmed with grief? Is Rāma’s
  mind not turned elsewhere? Will he save and carry me across this distress?”
'24': >-
  “Will Bharata, devoted to his brothers, send for my sake a formidable army—an
  akṣauhiṇī—its host protected by ministers and standards raised?”
'25': >-
  “Will the illustrious lord of vanaras, Sugrīva, come for my sake, surrounded
  by heroic monkeys, whose weapons are teeth and nails?”
'26': >-
  “Will the heroic Lakṣmaṇa, increaser of Sumitrā’s joy, smite and scatter the
  rākṣasas with showers and nets of arrows, skilled in weapons?”
'27': >-
  “Shall I, in a short time, see Rāvaṇa slain in battle by Rāma with his
  dreadful weapon—together with his friends and followers?”
'28': >-
  “Does not that face of his, golden in hue and lotus-fragrant, wither away in
  grief and sorrow because I am absent—like a lotus in a drained pool scorched
  by the sun?”
'29': >-
  “He who, under the pretext of dharma, abandoned his own kingdom and led me on
  foot into the forest—he to whom there was then neither fear nor grief—does he
  now still keep that steadfastness in his heart?”
'30': >-
  “He has no mother, nor father, nor any other more distinguished than I in
  affection, or equal to me. Therefore, O messenger, I would wish to live only
  until I might hear news of my beloved.”
'31': >-
  So spoke the lady—uttering to that lord among monkeys words of deep import,
  sweet in meaning—and, wishing to hear again his pleasing speech bound up with
  Rāma’s welfare, Rāmā (Sītā) fell silent.
'32': >-
  Having heard Sītā’s words, Māruti of terrible prowess placed his joined palms
  upon his head in reverence and then spoke in reply.
'33': >-
  “Rāma of lotus-eyes does not know that you are here. Therefore he does not
  swiftly bring you away, as Purandara (Indra) would bring Śacī.”
'34': >-
  “But as soon as he hears my words, Rāghava will quickly come, drawing forward
  a great army, accompanied by hosts of monkeys and bears.”
'35': >-
  “Checking and restraining the ocean—the abode of Varuṇa—unshakable though it
  is, with volleys of arrows, the son of Kakutstha will make Laṅkā a city in
  which the rākṣasas are brought to peace (i.e., destroyed and pacified).”
'36': >-
  “There, even if death itself, or the gods and mighty asuras, should stand in
  the path of Rāma, he will slay them also.”
'37': >-
  “O noble lady, filled with sorrow born of not seeing you, Rāma finds no
  comfort—like an elephant tormented by a lion.”
'38': >-
  “By Mandara and by the root-and-fruit I swear, O goddess; and by Malaya and
  Vindhya, by Meru and by Dardura (the mountains) I swear.”
'39': >-
  “Thus you shall behold Rāma’s face—lovely with beautiful eyes, with bimba-like
  lips and splendid earrings—risen like the full moon.”
'40': >-
  “Swiftly, O Vaidehī, you shall see Rāma on Mount Prasravaṇa, seated like
  Śatakratu (Indra) upon the head of Airāvata, king of elephants.”
'41': >-
  “Rāghava does not eat meat, nor does he partake of honey. He always eats, as
  the fifth portion, well-prepared forest fare.”
'42': >-
  “Neither gadflies, nor mosquitoes, nor insects, nor creeping creatures does
  Rāghava brush away from his body, his inner self wholly absorbed in you.”
'43': >-
  “Rāma is ever intent on meditation and ever devoted to grief; he thinks of
  nothing else at all—he has come under the dominion of love.”
'44': >-
  “Rāma is constantly sleepless; even when the best of men does sleep, he wakes
  again, uttering the sweet word, ‘Sītā!’”
'45': >-
  “Seeing a fruit or a flower, or anything else that delights a woman’s heart,
  again and again he sighs and speaks to you thus: ‘Alas, my beloved!’”
'46': >-
  “Thus, O goddess, that great-souled prince, firm in vow, ever burning with
  anguish and ever addressing you as ‘Sītā,’ strives only for your recovery.”
'47': >-
  Then the daughter of Videha became as though the clouds had departed and the
  moon remained at the opening of autumn: her sorrow dispelled by the recounting
  of Rāma, and yet her grief equal to Rāma’s grief.
'48': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-sixth chapter, named “The Presentation of the Ring,” in
  Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy, illustrious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the
  Ādikavi.
