  Now begins the one hundred and nineteenth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the
  glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Entry into the Daṇḍaka Forest.”
'1': >-
  Then Anasūyā, the knower of dharma, having heard that great account, embraced
  Maithilī with her arms and kissed her upon the head.
'2': >-
  “Clearly articulated in syllable and word, charming, and sweet is the speech
  spoken by you. The entire course of events of the svayaṃvara has indeed been
  heard by me. And by your narration I delight greatly, O firm and sweet-spoken
  one.”
'3': >-
  The glorious Sun had set, ushering in the auspicious night. And there is
  heard, at the time of twilight, the sound of birds—those scattered throughout
  the day in search of food—now settling down to rest for sleep.
'4': >-
  And these sages too, their bodies moist from the rites of consecration, with
  water-pots lifted in their hands, come together and return, their
  bark-garments drenched with water.
'5': >-
  When, in the sages’ agnihotra fires, offerings have been duly made according
  to rule, smoke, the color of a dove’s breast, is seen rising, driven upward by
  the wind.
'6': >-
  The trees, with scanty leaves, stand thickly grown on every side; and even
  though this region is open, the directions do not clearly appear.
'7': >-
  Creatures that roam by night move about everywhere; while these deer belonging
  to the ascetic grove lie down at the known and sacred tīrthas.
'8': >-
  The night has grown full, O Sītā, adorned with stars; and the moon, risen in
  the sky, is seen with its radiance spread forth as a mantle of moonlight.
'9': >-
  “Go now—I grant you leave. Be an attendant upon Rāma. For by your sweet
  speaking I have been thoroughly pleased and satisfied.”
'10': >-
  “And do you, Maithilī, adorn yourself for me at once, here before my eyes. O
  dear child, generate joy in me, shining with divine ornaments.”
'11': >-
  Thus adorned, Sītā—like the daughter of the gods—bowed with her head to that
  venerable lady, and then went forth facing toward Rāma.
'12': >-
  Then Rāghava, best among speakers, beheld Sītā thus ornamented; and by the
  affection shown by that ascetic lady, he rejoiced exceedingly.
'13': >-
  Thereupon Maithilī Sītā reported everything to Rāma—the favor bestowed by the
  holy woman: garments, ornaments, and garlands.
'14': >-
  Rāma became glad, and Lakṣmaṇa too, the great chariot-warrior; for they had
  seen such honor shown to Maithilī—something exceedingly rare among human
  beings.
'15': >-
  Then the son of Raghu, whose face was like the moon, pleased at heart, spent
  that sacred night, honored by ascetics and perfected beings (siddhas).
'16': >-
  When that night had passed, having bathed and having tended the sacred fires,
  the two tiger-like men took leave of the ascetics who dwelt and moved within
  the forest.
'17': >-
  Those forest-dwelling ascetics, followers of dharma, spoke to them of the
  movement within that forest—how it was overrun on every side by rākṣasas.
'18': >-
  “Man-eating rākṣasas of many forms, O Rāghava, dwell in this great wilderness;
  and there are also beasts of prey that feed on blood.”
'19': >-
  “Whether a dharma-observing ascetic is careless, or whether he is left
  vulnerable even after eating the remnants of food, they devour him in this
  great forest. Restrain them, O Rāghava.”
'20': >-
  “This is the path of the great ṛṣis who gather fruits in the forest; and by
  this route, O Rāghava, it is possible for you to go into the difficult
  forest.”
'21': >-
  Thus, by those ascetic twice-born sages with joined palms, a blessing of
  well-being was offered to him of supreme austerity; and Rāghava, together with
  his wife and with Lakṣmaṇa, entered the forest—like the sun entering the
  circle of clouds.
'22': >-
  Thus ends the one hundred and nineteenth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the
  sacred, glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the first epic, entitled “The Entry into
  the Daṇḍaka Forest.”
