  Now begins the Second Sarga of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  named “Waiting for the Coming of Night.”
'1': >-
  That mighty one, having crossed the ocean—unassailable and hard to
  traverse—stood upon the shore of Trikūṭa and, being composed in mind, beheld
  Laṅkā there.
'2': >-
  Then, by a shower of blossoms released from the trees, that valiant hero was
  rained upon; and there the monkey appeared as though made entirely of flowers.
'3': >-
  Though the illustrious one of supreme prowess had crossed a hundred yojanas,
  the monkey there, without even panting, did not feel fatigue.
'4': >-
  “I could, in regular course, traverse even many hundreds of yojanas; how much
  more, then, the ocean’s extent that is reckoned as but a hundred yojanas!”
'5': >-
  He, the foremost among the mighty, and the best even among those that leap,
  went with great speed to Laṅkā, having overleapt the vast ocean.
'6': >-
  He passed through meadows of fresh green, and fragrant forests, and through
  groves rich with honey, and amid mountains as well.
'7': >-
  That radiant Hanumān, bull among monkeys, ranged across mountains covered with
  trees and across blossoming stretches of forest.
'8': >-
  Standing on that mountain, the son of the Wind beheld forests and
  pleasure-groves, and saw Laṅkā situated upon the mountain’s summit.
'9': >-
  He saw śarala trees, and karṇikāra, and kharjūra palms in full bloom; also
  priyāla, muculinda, kuṭaja, and ketaka.
'10': >-
  He saw priyangu shrubs filled with fragrance, and nīpa trees, and the
  seven-leaved trees; also asana, kovidāra, and karavīra, all in blossom.
'11': >-
  He saw trees bowed down by the weight of flowers, and others with buds still
  closed; trees filled with birds, their crowns shaken by the wind.
'12': >-
  He saw ponds crowded with swans and kāraṇḍava birds, covered with lotuses and
  water-lilies; delightful grounds for sport of many kinds, and varied
  reservoirs of water.
'13': >-
  The great elephant among monkeys saw charming gardens spread with many kinds
  of trees, bearing fruits and blossoms in every season.
'14': >-
  Drawing near, the splendid one beheld Laṅkā, protected by Rāvaṇa, adorned with
  moats filled with lotuses and water-lilies.
'15': >-
  Protected by that Rāvaṇa because of the abduction of Sītā, and ringed all
  around by roaming rākṣasas bearing dreadful bows—
'16': >-
  —that great city he saw, delightful, enclosed by a golden rampart, and with
  houses like mountain-peaks, resembling autumnal clouds.
'17': >-
  He saw it encircled by lofty, pale-white gateways, crowded with hundreds of
  watchtowers, beautified by pennants and banners.
'18': >-
  Hanumān beheld Laṅkā with its divine golden archways, splendid with rows of
  creepers—like a city of the gods.
'19': >-
  The illustrious monkey saw Laṅkā set upon the mountain-top, with auspicious
  pale-white mansions—like a city moving in the sky.
'20': >-
  Protected by the lord of rākṣasas and fashioned by Viśvakarmā, Hanumān the
  monkey beheld it as though floating in the firmament.
'21': >-
  He saw her broad, with embankments and ramparts for hips, the ocean for her
  garment and the forest for her cloak; with śataghnī engines and tridents for
  her hair’s end, and watchtowers as her ornaments.
'22': >-
  Seeing Laṅkā—as though shaped by the mind itself, created by Viśvakarmā—the
  monkey, having reached the northern gate, began to reflect.
'23': >-
  Her best lofty mansions seemed to scratch the sky—like Kailāsa as a
  dwelling—appearing as though the very firmament were being held up by them.
'24': >-
  Filled with terrible rākṣasas like Bhogavatī filled with nāgas, unthinkable,
  excellently built, clearly defined—formerly inhabited by Kubera.
'25': >-
  Guarded by dreadful rākṣasas—many-fanged heroes bearing tridents and axes—like
  a cave protected by venomous serpents.
'26': >-
  Beholding her great security and also the ocean, the monkey reflected upon
  Rāvaṇa too, that terrible enemy.
'27': >-
  “Even if the monkeys come here, they will become fruitless in their efforts;
  for, indeed, Laṅkā cannot be conquered by battle—even by the gods.”
'28': >-
  “Having reached this Laṅkā, so difficult and inaccessible, this fortress
  protected by Rāvaṇa, what, indeed, will mighty-armed Rāghava do?”
'29': >-
  “No scope for conciliation is found with the rākṣasas; neither for gifts, nor
  for sowing dissension; nor, indeed, does battle appear feasible.”
'30': >-
  “The capacity exists only in four swift monkeys: the son of Vāli, Nīla,
  myself, and the wise king (Sugrīva).”
'31': >-
  “Until I learn whether Vaidehī lives or not, after seeing that daughter of
  Janaka, I shall then determine my course.”
'32': >-
  Then the great elephant among monkeys pondered for a moment, standing on that
  mountain peak, and then on Rāma’s success.
'33': >-
  “In this form I am not able to enter the city of the rākṣasas, guarded by
  cruel rākṣasas endowed with strength.”
'34': >-
  “The rākṣasas are of great vigor, great valor, and mighty strength. All of
  them must be outwitted by me while I search for Jānakī.”
'35': >-
  “Assuming a form that is hard to notice, by night I must enter the city of
  Laṅkā at the right time, to accomplish this great task.”
'36': >-
  Seeing such a city—hard to assail even for devas and asuras—Hanumān reflected,
  again and again drawing deep breaths.
'37': >-
  “By what means may I behold Maithilī, the daughter of Janaka, unseen by the
  lord of rākṣasas, the evil-souled Rāvaṇa?”
'38': >-
  “How may the work of Rāma, the self-possessed, not come to ruin? Alone, and
  all by myself, may I see the daughter of Janaka in a secluded place.”
'39': >-
  Purposes that are set do perish when opposed by place and time—like darkness
  at sunrise when it meets the sun—having encountered a messenger who is
  bewildered.
'40': >-
  Even a resolve, once formed, does not shine when the mind wavers between
  success and failure; for messengers who fancy themselves wise ruin
  undertakings here.
'41': >-
  “How shall the work not perish, and how shall confusion not arise? And how
  shall my leaping over the ocean not become in vain?”
'42': >-
  “If I am seen here by the rākṣasas, then this undertaking—meant for Rāma, the
  self-possessed—will become fruitless, to the advantage of Rāvaṇa who desires
  evil.”
'43': >-
  “Indeed, it is not possible to remain anywhere without being recognized by the
  rākṣasas—what then by any other form, even if one were to assume the very form
  of a rākṣasa?”
'44': >-
  “It is my conviction that even the wind could not move about here unknown; for
  nothing at all here is hidden from the rākṣasas of dreadful deeds.”
'45': >-
  “If I remain here covered only by my own form, I shall go to destruction—and
  my lord’s purpose will be made a laughingstock.”
'46': >-
  “Therefore, assuming a diminished form at night, I shall descend upon Laṅkā
  for the accomplishment of Rāghava’s purpose.”
'47': >-
  “Entering by night the very hard-to-approach city of Rāvaṇa, and searching
  every palace, I shall behold the daughter of Janaka.”
'48': >-
  Thus resolving, Hanumān—the monkey—looked for the sun’s setting; that hero,
  eager for the sight of Vaidehī, awaited it.
'49': >-
  And when the sun had set and night had come, Māruti compressed his body and
  became only the size of a cat—of wondrous appearance.
'50': >-
  At twilight Hanumān, mighty in valor, swiftly sprang up and entered the
  delightful city, laid out with broad, well-divided highways.
'51': >-
  He entered that city spread with rows of mansions, with pillars like gold,
  with latticed windows like refined gold, resembling a city of the Gandharvas.
'52': >-
  He saw the great city with mansions of seven and eight stories, with floors
  inlaid with crystal and adorned with gold.
'53': >-
  Adorned with designs of vaidūrya gems and embellished with nets of pearls—such
  were the houses of the rākṣasas that shone there in manifold ways.
'54': >-
  The rākṣasas’ golden, wondrous archways illuminated Laṅkā, adorned everywhere
  and thoroughly embellished.
'55': >-
  Beholding Laṅkā—unthinkable and of marvelous form—the great monkey became both
  downcast and delighted, eager for the sight of Vaidehī.
'56': >-
  He gazed upon that renowned city, filled with pale-white multi-storied aerial
  mansions, with archways and gateways latticed with most precious Jāmbūnada
  gold; protected by the arms of Rāvaṇa, and well-guarded by night-ranging
  rākṣasas of terrible might.
'57': >-
  The moon too, as though rendering aid to it, shone in the midst of hosts of
  stars; spreading his moonlight-canopy and extending it over the worlds, he
  rose—of many thousands of rays.
'58': >-
  That foremost of monkeys beheld the moon, white like a conch, like milk, like
  lotus-fibers—ascending and shining—like a swan gliding upon a lake.
'59': >-
  Thus ends the Second Sarga, named “Waiting for the Coming of Night,” in the
  Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
