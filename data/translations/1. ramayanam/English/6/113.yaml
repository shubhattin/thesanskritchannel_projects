  Then, in the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Yuddha-kanda, begins the one
  hundred and thirteenth sarga, called “The Lamentation of Ravana’s Inner
  Apartments (the Women of the Palace).”
'1': >-
  Hearing that Ravana had been slain by the great-souled Raghava, the rakshasi
  women, wasted by grief, rushed out from the inner apartments.
'2': >-
  Though restrained again and again in many ways, they wandered rolling in the
  dust of the earth, their hair loosened and dishevelled, tormented by
  sorrow—like cows whose calves have been slain.
'3': >-
  Going out by the northern gate along with rakshasas, they entered that
  dreadful battlefield, searching for their fallen lord.
'4': >-
  Crying, “O noble husband!” and everywhere crying, “Alas, O master!” they ran
  about over the earth, strewn with headless trunks and drenched in the mire of
  blood.
'5': >-
  Their eyes filled with tears, overcome by grief for their husband, they roared
  like female elephants whose leader of the herd has been killed.
'6': >-
  There they beheld Ravana—of huge body, great prowess, and great
  splendour—slain and lying on the ground, like a heap of blue collyrium.
'7': >-
  Seeing their husband suddenly, lying in the dust of battle, they fell upon his
  limbs, like forest-creepers cut down.
'8': >-
  One, clasping him with reverence and affection, wept aloud; another clung to
  his feet; another hung upon his neck.
'9': >-
  Another, lifting up her arms, rolled about upon the ground; and another,
  seeing the face of the slain, sank into swoon and bewilderment.
'10': >-
  Another, placing his head upon her lap, wept as she gazed upon his face,
  bathing that face with her tears, like a lotus sprinkled with dewy frost.
'11': >-
  Thus distressed, beholding Ravana slain upon the earth, they cried out in many
  ways from grief, and again and again they lamented.
'12': >-
  “He by whom Indra was made to tremble; he by whom Yama was made to tremble; he
  by whom King Vaishravana was deprived of the Pushpaka (car)!
'13': >-
  “He who in battle struck fear into Gandharvas, rishis, and the great-souled
  gods—he lies here, slain upon the battlefield!
'14': >-
  “He who knew no fear—whether from asuras or suras, or even from serpents—now
  has this fear arising from a mere human!
'15': >-
  “He who was invulnerable to the gods, and likewise to danavas and rakshasas—he
  lies here, slain in battle by a human, a foot-soldier!
'16': >-
  “He whom neither the gods could slay, nor the yakshas, nor the asuras—he, as
  it were a powerless creature, has been brought to death by a mortal!
'17': >-
  Speaking thus, those sorrowing women wept for him; and afflicted with grief
  again, they wailed and lamented repeatedly.
'18': >-
  “Because you did not listen to your friends who always spoke what was
  beneficial, Sita was brought here for your death, and the rakshasas too were
  struck down. Now we women, and you yourself as well—together—have fallen.
'19': >-
  “Even Vibhishana, the beloved brother who spoke wholesome words, was seen by
  you—deluded and desiring your own destruction—as one who had become harsh and
  hostile.”
'20': >-
  “If the Maithili Sita had been sent out by you to Rama, this dreadful
  calamity, great and root-destroying, would not have befallen us.”
'21': >-
  “Your brother would have had his desire fulfilled; Rama would have been a
  kinsman and friend; and we all would not have become widows, our wishes
  fulfilled, and with no enemies (remaining).”
'22': >-
  “But because you, cruel one, forcibly confined Sita, we rakshasas, and you
  yourself—this threefold (company)—have alike been brought down.”
'23': >-
  “Neither one’s own will, nor desire—O foremost of rakshasas—prevails; fate
  sets everything in motion. One who is struck down by fate is indeed slain by
  fate.”
'24': >-
  “This destruction of the vanaras and of your rakshasas in battle, and also
  your own (fall), O mighty-armed one, has come about through the conjunction of
  fate.”
'25': >-
  “By wealth, nor by desire, nor by valour, nor by command can the course of
  fate in the world—once it has arisen—be turned back.”
'26': >-
  Thus did those miserable wives of the lord of rakshasas lament—grief-stricken,
  their eyes clouded with tears—like kurari birds crying in anguish.
'27': >-
  Thus ends, in the rishi’s holy Valmiki-Ramayana, the Adi-kavya, in the
  Yuddha-kanda, the one hundred and thirteenth sarga, called “The Lamentation of
  Ravana’s Inner Apartments.”
