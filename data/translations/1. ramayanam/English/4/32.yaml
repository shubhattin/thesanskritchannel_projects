  Now begins the Thirty-second Sarga of the Kishkindha-kanda of the holy
  Valmiki-Ramayana, entitled “Hanuman’s Counsel (Mantra).”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of Angada, Sugriva—the prudent lord—on learning that
  Lakshmana had come in wrath, at once rose and relinquished his seat, together
  with his ministers.
'2': >-
  And he addressed those counsellors with words that he had carefully
  determined, weighing what was weighty and what was light—he who knew the
  science of counsel, was skilled in counsel, and steadfast in deliberations.
'3': >-
  “Nothing has been ill-spoken by me, nor has anything been ill-done by me; then
  why, I ponder, is Lakshmana—the brother of Raghava—angered?”
'4': >-
  “Surely, by those who are not my well-wishers—my enemies, ever intent on
  spying out a flaw—Raghava’s younger brother has been made to hear of faults in
  me that are not truly existent.”
'5': >-
  “Here, therefore, let all of you, according to your understanding and in
  proper manner, first ascertain—slowly and with skill—the certainty of the
  matter (its true state and cause).”
'6': >-
  “Indeed I have no fear of Lakshmana, nor even of Raghava; yet a friend, when
  angered while in his own place, surely gives rise to agitation.”
'7': >-
  “In every way it is easy to win a friend; hard indeed is the guarding of
  friendship. For minds are inconstant, and affection is broken even by a slight
  cause.”
'8': >-
  “Therefore I am fearful on account of that great-souled Rama—because it is not
  possible for me to repay what he has done for me (as a benefaction), though it
  ought to be repaid.”
'9': >-
  When Sugriva had spoken thus, Hanuman—the foremost of the Vanaras—spoke, by
  his own reasoning, in the midst of the Vanara counsellors:
'10': >-
  “It is in no way a wonder, O lord of the hosts of Vanaras, that you do not
  forget the auspicious help rendered with great affection.”
'11': >-
  “For the heroic Raghava, casting fear far away (without hesitation), slew
  Vali—whose prowess was equal to Indra’s—for the sake of what was dear to you.”
'12': >-
  “Raghava is certainly angered here out of wounded affection—of this there is
  no doubt; he has sent his brother Lakshmana, the increaser of auspicious
  fortune, (to you).”
'13': >-
  “You, heedless, do not perceive the right time, O best among those who know
  time. The lovely autumn has set in—dark as the blossomed saptachchhada tree.”
'14': >-
  “The sky is clear, with planets and stars shining pure; the clouds have
  vanished; all the quarters are serene, and so too are the rivers and the
  lakes.”
'15': >-
  “You do not recognize that the time for effort has arrived, O foremost of
  Vanaras. It is plain that you are negligent; therefore has this Lakshmana come
  here.”
'16': >-
  “Harsh words spoken by another are to be borne by you, regarding the
  great-souled Raghava—who is afflicted, and whose wife has been stolen away.”
'17': >-
  “For you who have committed an offence, I see no other fitting course, except
  to appease Lakshmana with joined palms (in supplication).”
'18': >-
  “A king must surely be addressed by appointed ministers with what is
  beneficial. Therefore, casting aside fear on this account, I speak a
  considered word.”
'19': >-
  “If enraged, the mighty Raghava, taking up his bow, is able to bring the whole
  world—together with Devas, Asuras, and Gandharvas—under his control.”
'20': >-
  “He is not one who can be angered and then later again be appeased—especially
  by a grateful man who remembers former assistance rendered.”
'21': >-
  “Therefore, O king, bowing with your head to him—together with your son and
  your friends—remain at the proper time under his will, like a wife under the
  authority of her husband.”
'22': >-
  “It is not proper for you, O lord of Vanaras, even in your mind to set aside
  the command of Rama and Rama’s younger brother; for your mind shall come to
  know the human might of this Rama—Raghava—whose splendour is like that of the
  king of the gods.”
'23': >-
  Thus ends the Thirty-second Sarga of the Kishkindha-kanda in the holy
  Valmiki-Ramayana, the primal epic, entitled “Hanuman’s Counsel (Mantra).”
