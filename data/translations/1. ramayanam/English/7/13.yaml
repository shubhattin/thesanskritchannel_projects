  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins the
  thirteenth chapter, named “The Slaying of Kubera’s Messenger.”
'1': >-
  Then, by the sending forth of the Lord of the worlds, at a certain time, there
  came upon Kumbhakarṇa a fierce sleep, taking form as it were and overpowering
  him.
'2': >-
  Thereupon Kumbhakarṇa spoke these words to his seated brother: “O king, sleep
  oppresses me; have my abode made.”
'3': >-
  Then, by the king’s command, artisans like unto Viśvakarman were engaged. They
  made it vast—one yojana in breadth, and then twice that in length.
'4': >-
  For Kumbhakarṇa they fashioned a fair and splendid dwelling, free from all
  hindrance, adorned everywhere with crystal and golden pillars of wondrous
  workmanship.
'5': >-
  It had stairways wrought of vaidūrya-gems, and lattices of tinkling
  kinkiṇī-bells; it was set with ivory gateways, and had platforms of diamond
  and crystal.
'6': >-
  That rākṣasa caused to be built a delightful mansion, abounding in every
  comfort—ever a giver of pleasure on all sides—like Meru’s holy cavern.
'7': >-
  There the mighty Kumbhakarṇa, having entered into sleep, lay for many
  thousands of years and did not awaken.
'8': >-
  But when Kumbhakarṇa was thus overpowered by sleep, Daśānana, unrestrained,
  struck down devas, ṛṣis, yakṣas, and gandharvas.
'9': >-
  And those delightful, wondrous gardens—Nandana and the rest—going thither in
  great wrath, Daśānana would shatter them.
'10': >-
  Sporting in the river like an elephant, hurling trees like the wind, and
  rending mountains like a discharged thunderbolt, that rākṣasa laid all waste.
'11': >-
  Learning of such conduct in Daśagrīva, the Lord of wealth (Dhanada), who knew
  dharma, recalled the conduct befitting his lineage—and also considered his own
  former course.
'12': >-
  Then Vaiśravaṇa, desiring to show brotherly regard, sent a messenger to
  Laṅkā—for Daśagrīva’s very welfare.
'13': >-
  He went to the city of Laṅkā and approached Vibhīṣaṇa. Honoured by him
  according to dharma, he was asked the reason for his coming.
'14': >-
  After inquiring of the king’s welfare and that of his kinsmen, Vibhīṣaṇa led
  him into the assembly and showed him Daśānana seated there.
'15': >-
  Beholding there the king, blazing with his own splendour, the messenger
  honoured him with the word “Victory!” and then stood silent with folded
  reverence.
'16': >-
  Then the messenger spoke to Daśagrīva, who sat there upon an excellent couch,
  adorned with fine coverings:
'17': >-
  “O king, I shall tell you all that your brother said—words befitting you both,
  O hero, in respect of your conduct and your lineage.
'18': >-
  ‘Well indeed—this much is sufficient; a compendium of good conduct has been
  made. Good indeed would it be if steadiness in dharma were established, if it
  can be done.’
'19': >-
  “I have seen Nandana broken; I have heard that sages have been slain; and, O
  king, I have heard that the devas are making ready an enterprise against you.
'20': >-
  “And I myself, O lord of rākṣasas, have been rejected by you again and again;
  for your own kinsmen, dear and delightful, were offended from your very
  childhood.
'21': >-
  “But I went to the back of Himavat to practise dharma, undertaking a dreadful
  observance, restrained and with senses under control.
'22': >-
  “There I beheld the Lord, that God together with the Goddess. By fate, my left
  eye fell upon the Goddess there.
'23': >-
  “‘Who might this auspicious one be?’—not for any other reason; for, assuming
  an incomparable form, Rudrāṇī stood there.
'24': >-
  “By the Goddess’s divine potency my left eye was scorched; like a light dimmed
  by dust, it became tawny and discoloured.
'25': >-
  “Then, going to another wide and lonely slope of that mountain, in silence I
  maintained a great vow of steady absorption for eight hundred years.
'26': >-
  “When that observance was completed, there the God Maheśvara—the Lord—pleased,
  with a glad heart, spoke to me these words:
'27': >-
  “‘Because you beheld the Goddess’s form, you have indeed obtained this
  tawny-eyed state. I am pleased with your austerity, O knower of dharma, O man
  of good vows.
'28': >-
  “‘This vow has been performed by me, and also by you, O lord of wealth; there
  is no third person who would practise such a vow as this.
'29': >-
  “‘This observance, firm in resolve, was formerly devised by me. Therefore, O
  gentle one, O lord of wealth, approve friendship with me.’
'30': >-
  “‘Conquered by your austerities—be my friend, O sinless one. And that left eye
  of yours, scorched by the Goddess’s potency—
'31': >-
  “‘—the name “Eka-akṣi-piṅgala” (Tawny One-Eyed) shall remain for you forever.’
  Thus obtaining friendship with him and also permission from Śaṅkara,
'32': “I have now come; and I have heard of your settled course in sin.
'33': >-
  “Turn back from unions with the unrighteous; desist from defiling your
  lineage. For the means of your slaying are being deliberated by the devas
  together with companies of ṛṣis.”
'34': >-
  Thus addressed, Daśagrīva, with eyes reddened in wrath, clenching his fists
  and grinding his teeth, spoke these words:
'35': >-
  “Your words are known to me, O messenger—the speech you utter. You are not he,
  nor is he the one, by whom you have been thus urged, as though by a brother.
'36': >-
  “This is not for my good that the protector of wealth says; rather, fool, he
  proclaims that friendship with Maheśvara, indeed!
'37': >-
  “This that you have spoken is not to be endured by me. Only for so long, O
  messenger, have I tolerated that one.”
'38': >-
  “‘A guru, an elder, is not to be slain by me’—so he thinks. But now, having
  heard your words, this resolve has been formed by me:
'39': “Leaning upon the might of my arms, I shall conquer even the three worlds! ”
'40': >-
  “This very moment, for the sake of that one alone, I shall send those four
  guardians of the worlds to Yama’s imperishable domain.”
'41': >-
  Having spoken thus, the lord of Laṅkā struck the messenger with a sword, and
  gave him to be devoured by the wicked-souled rākṣasas.
'42': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa, having thus (as he deemed) secured auspiciousness, mounted his
  chariot; and, yearning for the conquest of the three worlds, he went to where
  the Lord of wealth was.
'43': >-
  Thus ends the thirteenth chapter, named “The Slaying of Kubera’s Messenger,”
  in the Uttarakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic of the
  seers.
