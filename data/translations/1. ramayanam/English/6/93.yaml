'0': >-
  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa,
  begins the ninety-third canto, named “The Cessation of the Attempt to Slay
  Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon the counsellors of the son of Pulastya (Rāvaṇa), having heard of the
  slaying of Indrajit, quickly went and reported it to Daśagrīva, after
  ascertaining the truth.
'2': >-
  “In battle, O great king, thy son—Indrajit of great splendour—hath been slain
  by Lakṣmaṇa, while we looked on, with Vibhīṣaṇa as his aid.”
'3': >-
  “That hero, who had met heroes and had never been overcome in combats, hath
  been slain in the fight by Lakṣmaṇa—thy heroic son, the conqueror of the lord
  of the gods.”
'4': >-
  “He hath gone to the supreme worlds, having satisfied Lakṣmaṇa with his
  arrows; and thou, hearing that dreadful and fearsome tidings—the terrible
  death of thy son—”
'5': >-
  “Indrajit, in that conflict, was seized by a great swoon of bewilderment; and
  after a long while, regaining consciousness, that king, the bull among
  Rākṣasas,”
'6': >-
  “Afflicted and cast down with grief for his son, with senses confounded,
  lamented: ‘Alas, O foremost of the Rākṣasa host—my child of mighty strength!’”
'7': >-
  “‘Having conquered Indra, how hast thou today come under the power of
  Lakṣmaṇa? Surely, when wrathful with thy shafts, thou wouldst even have
  pierced the very Yama, the ender of time!’”
'8': >-
  “‘The peaks of Mandara itself—how much more then Lakṣmaṇa in battle! Today the
  king Vaivasvata (Yama) is indeed more esteemed by me than ever before.’”
'9': >-
  “‘By whom, O mighty-armed one, thou hast today been joined with the law of
  Death (the destiny that ends all); this is the path of good warriors, even
  among all the hosts of the immortals: that man who is slain while acting for
  his lord attains heaven.’”
'10': >-
  “‘Today all the hosts of gods, the guardians of the worlds, and the great
  sages, hearing that Indrajit is slain, shall sleep in comfort, free from
  fear.’”
'11': >-
  “‘Today the three worlds entire, and the earth with all her forests, bereft of
  Indrajit alone, appear to me as though empty.’”
'12': >-
  “‘Today I shall hear within the inner chambers the wailing of the maidens of
  the Rākṣasas, like the trumpeting of a herd of she-elephants resounding in a
  mountain cave.’”
'13': >-
  “‘The heir-apparency, and Laṅkā, and the Rākṣasas, O scorcher of foes—thy
  mother and me, and thy wives—whither hast thou gone, abandoning us?’”
'14': >-
  “‘O hero, thou having gone to the abode of Yama, it is for me to perform the
  rites for the departed; indeed thou hast taken to a course contrary to what
  should be.’”
'15': >-
  “‘While Sugrīva lives, and Lakṣmaṇa, and Rāghava with him, without extracting
  the dart that is in my heart, whither hast thou gone, forsaking us?’”
'16': >-
  Thus, while Rāvaṇa, lord of the Rākṣasas, was tormented by lamentation of this
  kind, a mighty wrath born of the calamity of his son entered into him.
'17': >-
  By nature prone to anger, and now further afflicted by his son’s ruin, those
  troubles kindled him like sunbeams kindling a blazing sun in the heat of
  summer.
'18': >-
  With knit brows and gathered frowns his forehead shone, like the ocean at the
  end of an age with great waves and crocodiles.
'19': >-
  As he yawned with fury, from his mouth there leapt forth, as it were visibly,
  a smoky flame—like fire springing from the mouth of Vṛtra.
'20': >-
  Burning with the death of his son, that hero, fallen under the sway of wrath,
  considered; and Rāvaṇa in his mind approved the slaying of Vaidehī (Sītā).
'21': >-
  In that most dreadful Rāvaṇa—whose nature was red with rage and further
  reddened by the fire of anger—his eyes blazed fiercely.
'22': >-
  That terrible form of his, by nature dreadful and overwhelmed by the fire of
  wrath, became like the unapproachable form of Rudra when enraged.
'23': >-
  From the eyes of that angered one tears fell—like drops of clarified butter,
  with flames, falling from two blazing lamps.
'24': >-
  As he ground his teeth, the sound of his teeth was heard—like the creaking of
  a machine being drawn and churned by Dānavas.
'25': >-
  Like the fire of Time (kāla-agni) when enraged, whichever direction he looked
  toward, in that very direction the Rākṣasas, struck with fear, shrank away and
  hid themselves.
'26': >-
  Beholding him—wrathful like Death itself, eager to devour all that moves and
  stands still—while he surveyed every quarter, the Rākṣasas dared not approach
  him.
'27': >-
  Then, exceedingly enraged, Rāvaṇa, lord of the Rākṣasas, spoke among the
  Rākṣasas, wishing to stiffen and rally them for battle:
'28': >-
  “For thousands of years have I practised supreme austerity; in those seasons
  and occasions, the Self-born Brahmā was well pleased.”
'29': >-
  “By the fruition of that austerity, and by the grace of the Self-born, never
  at any time have I fear from Asuras or from Devas.”
'30': >-
  “The armour given me by Brahmā, radiant like the sun—amid the crushing battles
  of gods and Asuras—hath not been cut through even by fists like thunderbolts.”
'31': >-
  “Therefore, joined with that, standing upon my chariot here in this conflict,
  who today in battle would confront me—even Purandara (Indra) himself face to
  face?”
'32': >-
  “That great bow, together with its arrows, which, being graciously disposed,
  the Self-born bestowed on me in the wars of gods and Asuras—”
'33': >-
  “Today, amid hundreds of terrifying musical instruments, let my dreadful bow
  be raised—for the slaying of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa in the supreme battle.”
'34': >-
  Thus, scorched by the death of his son, cruel and fallen under the power of
  wrath, Rāvaṇa, considering, resolved in his mind to slay Sītā.
'35': >-
  Then that copper-eyed one—most terrible, of dreadful aspect—gazing around, in
  a wretched voice addressed all those night-rangers:
'36': >-
  “By the māyā of my child, for the purpose of deceiving the forest-dwellers,
  there was shown there only so much—‘This is Sītā’—as though she were slain.”
'37': >-
  “But now this very deed I shall truly accomplish, for my own satisfaction: I
  shall destroy Vaidehī, who follows that kṣatriya-wretch (Rāma) as her vow.”
'38': >-
  Having spoken thus to his ministers, he swiftly grasped his sword, drawing
  forth the weapon—excellent in quality, bright with the splendour of stainless
  metal.
'39': >-
  He sprang forth in haste, surrounded by his ministers and his wives—Rāvaṇa,
  his mind greatly disturbed by grief for his son.
'40': >-
  Seeing that enraged Rākṣasa going suddenly with sword in hand to the place
  where Maithilī was, they cried out with lion-roars.
'41': >-
  And embracing one another, beholding that wrathful Rākṣasa, they said: “Today,
  seeing him, those two brothers will indeed be sorely distressed.”
'42': >-
  “For the four guardians of the worlds have been conquered by him when enraged,
  and many other enemies have been struck down by him in battles.”
'43': >-
  “Rāvaṇa, bringing them, enjoys the treasures in the three worlds; and in
  valour and in strength there is none on earth equal to him.”
'44': >-
  While they thus conversed as they went to the Aśoka grove, Rāvaṇa, seized with
  wrath, rushed toward Vaidehī.
'45': >-
  Though restrained by well-wishing friends of wholesome counsel, he,
  exceedingly enraged, still charged forward—like a planet in the sky rushing
  upon Rohiṇī.
'46': >-
  But Maithilī, protected by the blameless rākṣasīs, beheld that enraged Rākṣasa
  bearing a sharp sword.
'47': >-
  Hearing and seeing him with sword in hand, the daughter of Janaka was shaken
  with fear—him who, though again and again held back by friends, would not turn
  away.
'48': >-
  Sītā, overwhelmed with sorrow, lamenting, spoke thus: “As he, in anger,
  himself rushes upon me,”
'49': >-
  “that evil-minded one will slay me, though I have a protector, as though I
  were helpless—me who again and again urged my lord, and who follow my husband
  as my vow.”
'50': >-
  “When he said, ‘Be my wife,’ I surely rejected him; and now, because I do not
  attend to him, he has plainly fallen into despair.”
'51': >-
  “Overcome by rage and delusion, he is clearly intent on killing me. Or else
  those two tiger-like men, the brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa,”
'52': >-
  “have today been struck down in battle by that ignoble one, on my account; for
  I have heard the great and terrible clamour of the Rākṣasas.”
'53': >-
  “And the delighted shouting of many here, and their cries of joy—alas, shame
  on me! through my cause comes this destruction of the two princes.”
'54': >-
  “Or else, grieving for his son, without having slain Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, that
  fierce Rākṣasa of sinful resolve will wreak his rage upon me.”
'55': >-
  “And that word of Hanumān was not followed by me, petty-minded as I was—when,
  though not overcome by fatigue, I might have mounted upon his back.”
'56': >-
  “Then I would not today be lamenting thus, dwelling chaste in my husband’s
  embrace. I think the heart of that Kausalyā will surely break.”
'57': >-
  “When, having but one son, she hears that her son is lost in battle, she will
  weep, remembering the birth, the childhood, and the youth of that great-souled
  one,”
'58': >-
  “and his righteous deeds and his beauty. Hopeless upon her son being slain,
  having performed the śrāddha, senseless with grief,”
'59': >-
  “she will surely look upon fire (to enter it), or else enter the waters. Shame
  upon that crooked, vile Mantharā, of sinful resolve,”
'60': >-
  “by reason of whom Kausalyā will fall into this sorrow.” Thus, seeing
  Maithilī—an ascetic woman—lamenting,
'61': >-
  like Rohiṇī brought under the power of a planet, bereft of the moon, in that
  very interval there was (present) a minister of his, virtuous and pure,
'62': >-
  named Supārśva, wise, who said these words to Rāvaṇa, the best of Rākṣasas,
  while he was being restrained by the ministers:
'63': >-
  “How, O Daśagrīva, younger brother of Vaiśravaṇa, dost thou desire to slay
  Vaidehī out of wrath, having cast aside dharma?”
'64': >-
  “O hero, versed in Vedas, knowledge, and vows, bathed in sacred observances,
  devoted likewise to thine own rites—why dost thou, O lord of Rākṣasas, deem
  the killing of a woman fit?”
'65': >-
  “O king, look upon Maithilī, endowed with beauty; in that very battle, along
  with us, abandon thy wrath.”
'66': >-
  “This very day, on the fourteenth of the dark fortnight, perform the rites of
  setting forth; then, on the new-moon night, go out, surrounded by forces, for
  victory.”
'67': >-
  “A hero, wise, a chariot-warrior, a swordsman, mounted on the best of
  chariots—having slain Rāma, the son of Daśaratha, thou shalt obtain Maithilī.”
'68': >-
  That wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, accepting the righteous counsel spoken by his
  friend, went then to his palace; and thereafter the mighty one again proceeded
  to the assembly-hall, surrounded by his friends.
'69': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-third canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, named “The Cessation of the Attempt to Slay
  Sītā.”
