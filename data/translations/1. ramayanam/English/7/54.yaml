  Then, in the revered Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the fifty-fourth
  sarga, called “The Entry of Nṛga into the Pit (Śvabhra),” begins.
'1': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, Lakṣmaṇa—knower of the highest truth—said, with joined
  palms, these words to Rāghava of blazing splendour:
'2': >-
  “O Kākutstha, for a slight offence such a curse from two brāhmaṇas is
  astonishing—like a second staff of chastisement of Yama himself upon the great
  Nṛga, that royal seer.”
'3': >-
  “O bull among men, having heard that he himself had become tainted with sin,
  what indeed did King Nṛga say to those two brāhmaṇas who were filled with
  wrath?”
'4': >-
  Thus addressed by Lakṣmaṇa, Rāghava again replied: “Listen, gentle one, to how
  formerly that king, struck by the curse, (acted and spoke).”
'5': >-
  Then, while those two brāhmaṇas were proceeding on the road, Nṛga, realizing
  (what had happened) at that time, summoned all his counsellors, the leading
  citizens and guild-heads, along with his family priest.
'6': >-
  King Nṛga then spoke to them all—his ministers and all his subjects as
  well—being deeply overcome with grief: “Hear me with minds composed.”
'7': >-
  “Nārada and Parvata—both auspicious and blameless—having given me a great
  fear, have departed through the three worlds, having become like the wind
  (swift and ungraspable).”
'8': >-
  “Let this boy, named Vasu, be consecrated today as king. And let a pit
  (śvabhra) that is pleasant to the touch be fashioned for me by artisans—where
  I shall undergo and exhaust the curse that has issued from the brāhmaṇas.”
'9': >-
  “Let the craftsmen make one pit that wards off the rains, another that wards
  off the cold; and let one, pleasant to the touch, ward off the summer-heat.”
'10': >-
  “Let many kinds of fruit-bearing trees be planted, and creepers that bear
  blossoms; and let shady thickets and shrubs of various sorts be set in place.”
'11': >-
  “And let the surroundings of the pits be made delightful in every direction;
  here I shall dwell in comfort until the turning of time (brings the destined
  change).”
'12': >-
  “And let fragrant flowers be provided there every day, so that they may
  surround me all around for a full half-yojana.”
'13': >-
  Having thus arranged these matters, he then gave instructions to Vasu: “Ever
  devoted to dharma, O son, protect the people according to the kṣatriya’s
  duty.”
'14': >-
  “You have seen with your own eyes how the curse was cast upon me by two
  brāhmaṇas—both angered—though the offence was but of that measure. O best of
  men!”
'15': >-
  “Do not cause yourself bodily anguish on my account, O bull among men. Fate
  (Kṛtānta) is skilful, my son, by which I have been brought to this calamity.”
'16': >-
  “A man attains only what is to be attained; he goes only where he is to go; he
  obtains only what is to be obtained—both sorrows and also joys.”
'17': “Formerly, in another birth, my dear child—do not fall into grief.”
'18': >-
  Having spoken thus, that greatly renowned king addressed his son; and then, O
  bull among men, King Nṛga went to that well-made pit to dwell there.
'19': >-
  Thus, having entered at that very time into that pit adorned with great
  jewels, the high-souled king then brought to fulfilment (and began to exhaust)
  the curse that had been released in anger by the two brāhmaṇas.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fourth sarga, called “The Entry of Nṛga into the Pit,” in
  the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
