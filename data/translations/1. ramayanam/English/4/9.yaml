  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, is
  the ninth chapter, called “The Sequential Account of the Enmity”.
'1': >-
  “Vālī is my brother—my elder— a slayer of foes; ever highly esteemed by our
  father, and formerly by me as well.”
'2': >-
  “When our father had departed (from this world), the ministers, saying, ‘He is
  the elder,’ appointed him—the lord of the monkeys—to the sovereignty, with the
  highest approval.”
'3': >-
  “While he governed that great kingdom, inherited from our father and
  forefathers, I at all times remained bowed to him, standing like a servant at
  his command.”
'4': >-
  “There was a mighty one named Māyāvī, radiant in prowess, the elder-born son
  of Dundubhi; through him, long ago, a great enmity arose with Vālī, caused on
  account of a woman.”
'5': >-
  “He came in the night, when the people were asleep, to the gate of Kiṣkindhā,
  and roaring in great fury, challenged Vālī to battle.”
'6': >-
  “My brother Vālī, though asleep, hearing that dreadful roar of the roaring
  one, could not endure it; at once he sprang forth swiftly.”
'7': >-
  “Indeed, he rushed out in wrath to slay that foremost of asuras, even though
  he was restrained by the women and by me, with my humbled spirit.”
'8': >-
  “But that mighty one, shaking us all off, went forth; and then I too, out of
  affection, went out together with Vālī.”
'9': >-
  “Seeing my brother and me standing at a distance, the asura, seized by fear,
  fled then in great haste.”
'10': >-
  “As he fled in terror, we two went even swifter; and the path too was made
  visible at that time by the moon rising.”
'11': >-
  “The asura entered, in his speed, a great cavern in the earth—difficult of
  access, covered over with grass—having reached it while we stood close by.”
'12': >-
  “Seeing that enemy enter the cave, Vālī, overcome by wrath and with his senses
  agitated, spoke to me then.”
'13': >-
  ‘Stand here today, Sugrīva, at the cave’s mouth, vigilant and composed, until
  I enter here and slay the enemy in battle.’
'14': >-
  “When I heard these words, I entreated that afflicter of foes; but after
  cursing me and striking me with his feet, he entered the cave.”
'15': >-
  “After he had entered, a full year passed while he was within the cave; and as
  I remained stationed at the cave’s mouth, that time went by.”
'16': >-
  “But I, knowing him to be lost, was agitated with alarm out of affection; I
  did not see my brother, and my mind suspected sin (some evil had occurred).”
'17': >-
  “Then, after a long time, I saw frothing blood issuing out from that cave;
  seeing it, I was exceedingly distressed.”
'18': >-
  “And the sound of roaring asuras reached my ears; but there was not the heavy
  sound even of one crying out, as of one engaged in battle.”
'19': >-
  “Then, understanding by my mind—by those signs—that my brother had been slain,
  I closed the cave’s mouth with a rock like a mountain.”
'20': >-
  “Tormented by grief, having offered a libation of water, I came back to
  Kiṣkindhā, O friend; and you heard from the ministers, with effort, of that
  matter—though I kept myself hidden.”
'21': >-
  “Then, gathered together with them, I was consecrated; and I ruled his
  kingdom, by right, O Rāghava.”
'22': >-
  “But that monkey returned, having slain the enemy-dānava; and seeing me
  consecrated, his eyes reddened in wrath.”
'23': >-
  “Binding my ministers, he spoke harsh words—he who was capable of
  punishment—against that sinful me, O Rāghava.”
'24': >-
  “My judgment did not proceed, held back by the constraint of reverence due to
  an elder brother; having slain the enemy, my brother then entered the city.”
'25': >-
  “Honouring that great-souled one, I bowed to him duly; and he, delighted in
  his inner heart, spoke blessings to me.”
'26': >-
  “Having bowed, I touched his feet with my diadem, O lord; yet Vālī, out of
  anger toward me, did not show favour.”
'27': >-
  Thus ends the ninth chapter, called “The Sequential Account of the Enmity,” in
  the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
