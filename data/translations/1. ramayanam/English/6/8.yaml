  Now begins the Eighth Sarga, named “The Words of Prahasta and Others,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then the rākṣasa named Prahasta—dark as a rain-laden cloud—valiant and at that
  time a commander of the army, spoke with folded hands these words:
'2': >-
  Devas, dānavas, gandharvas, piśācas, birds, and serpents—indeed all of them
  can be subdued; how much more, then, two mere human beings in battle?
'3': >-
  All of us, being heedless and overconfident, have been deceived by Hanumān. So
  long as I yet live, that forest-ranging one shall not depart alive.
'4': >-
  Command me, and I shall make this whole land—bounded by the ocean and filled
  with mountains, forests, and groves—devoid of vānaras.
'5': >-
  And I shall also provide protection from the vānaras, O night-ranger; no
  sorrow arising from your own fault shall befall you in the least.
'6': >-
  Then a rākṣasa named Durmukha, exceedingly enraged, spoke: “Indeed this cannot
  be endured—the outrage done to all of us!
'7': >-
  This humiliation is an even greater insult to the city and to the inner
  apartments of the palace: that a mere vānara has violated the majesty of the
  prosperous lord of rākṣasas.
'8': >-
  This very moment I shall go alone and drive back the vānaras—whether they have
  entered the dreadful ocean, or the sky, or even the netherworld!
'9': >-
  Then the mighty rākṣasa Vajradaṃṣṭra, burning with wrath, spoke—having seized
  a terrible iron club, stained with flesh and blood:
'10': >-
  What need have we of Hanumān, that wretched ascetic? When Rāma the
  unconquerable stands there, and Sugrīva as well, together with Lakṣmaṇa!
'11': >-
  Today I shall go and, single-handed, slay Rāma together with Sugrīva and
  Lakṣmaṇa with this club, after throwing the monkey-host into confusion.
'12': >-
  Hear yet another word of mine, O King, if you so desire: he who is skilled in
  stratagems, ever vigilant, indeed conquers enemies.
'13': >-
  There are thousands of rākṣasas—heroes who can assume any form at will,
  exceedingly formidable and of dreadful appearance—appointed under the lord of
  rākṣasas.
'14': >-
  Let them all approach the son of Kakutstha while wearing human forms, and
  without agitation address the best of the Raghus.
'15': >-
  ‘We have been sent by Bharata himself—your younger brother; he, having
  mustered an army, will quickly come hither.’
'16': >-
  Then we, bearing tridents, spears, and maces, with bows and arrows and swords
  in hand, shall swiftly go there.
'17': >-
  Stationed in groups in the sky, after slaying that monkey-host, with a great
  shower of rocks as weapons we shall send them to the abode of Yama.
'18': >-
  And if thus Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa should come near, then—surely—having been
  deprived of strength, they will give up their very lives.
'19': >-
  Then the heroic and powerful Nikumbha—scion of Kumbhakarṇa’s line—utterly
  enraged, spoke to Rāvaṇa, the terror of the worlds:
'20': >-
  Let all of you remain here, assembled with the great king. I alone shall slay
  Rāghava together with Lakṣmaṇa,
'21': >-
  and Sugrīva with Hanumān, and all these vānaras here.” Then the rākṣasa named
  Vajrahanu, huge as a mountain, spoke.
'22': >-
  Enraged, licking the corners of his mouth with his tongue, he said: “Let you
  all do your tasks at ease, free from fevered anxiety.
'23': >-
  I alone shall devour this entire monkey-host. Let them be at peace—sport
  without care, untroubled, and drink honeyed liquor (vāruṇī).”
'24': >-
  I alone shall kill Sugrīva together with Lakṣmaṇa, and Aṅgada and Hanumān, and
  all the vānaras here.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the Eighth Sarga, named “The Words of Prahasta and Others,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
