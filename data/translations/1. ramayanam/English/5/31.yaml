  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa,
  begins the thirty-first chapter, named “The Account of Rāma’s Story (as
  heard).”
'1': >-
  Thus, after pondering many kinds of thoughts, that great-minded Hanumān spoke
  to Vaidehī (Sītā) words that were sweet to hear.
'2': >-
  “There was a king named Daśaratha, possessed of chariots, elephants, and
  horses—of meritorious conduct, of exalted fame, and greatly renowned among the
  Ikṣvākus.”
'3': >-
  “Foremost in virtues among royal sages, and by austerity the equal of seers;
  born in the line of universal monarchs, and in prowess like Purandara
  (Indra).”
'4': >-
  “Delighting in non-violence, free from meanness, compassionate, and true in
  valor; the chief of the Ikṣvāku dynasty, endowed with prosperity and an
  increaser of prosperity.”
'5': >-
  “Adorned with the marks of royalty, of broad splendor, the bull among kings;
  renowned throughout the four quarters of the earth—giver of happiness and
  himself happy.”
'6': >-
  “His dear eldest son, with a face like the lord of stars (the moon), was named
  Rāma—skilled in all knowledge, and the foremost of all wielders of the bow.”
'7': >-
  “He is the protector of his own righteous conduct, the protector of his own
  people as well; the protector of living beings, and of Dharma—scorcher of
  foes.”
'8': >-
  “Obedient to the command of his aged father—whose resolve was ever to
  truth—he, the heroic one, went forth to the forest, together with his wife and
  with his brother.”
'9': >-
  “There, in that great wilderness, while roaming in the hunt, he slew many
  mighty rākṣasas who could assume forms at will.”
'10': >-
  “Hearing of the slaughter at Jana-sthāna and of Khara and Dūṣaṇa being slain,
  then you, Jānakī, were carried off by Rāvaṇa, through spite.”
'11': >-
  “Deceiving Rāma in the forest by an illusory magic in the form of a deer—while
  he searched for that blameless goddess Sītā…”
'12': >-
  “…Rāma met in the forest a friend named Sugrīva, the monkey. Then Rāma,
  conqueror of enemy strongholds, slew Vālin,”},{
'13': >-
  “and bestowed the sovereignty of the monkeys upon the great-souled Sugrīva.
  Commissioned by Sugrīva, monkeys able to assume forms at will…”
'14': >-
  “…searched for that goddess in all directions, by thousands. I—on the word of
  Sampāti—(came to know of her) at a distance extending a hundred yojanas.”
'15': >-
  “For the sake of that wide-eyed lady, I, swift in speed, leapt across the
  ocean; and her—of such form, such complexion, and endowed with such auspicious
  beauty—”
'16': >-
  “—I have heard of her from Rāghava; she has now been found by me.” Having
  spoken thus, that best of monkeys ceased his speech.
'17': ''
'18': >-
  Hearing the words of the lord of monkeys, Sītā looked to all the directions
  and the intermediate quarters; and she herself attained supreme joy,
  remembering Rāma with her whole being.
'19': >-
  As she looked sideways, upward, and likewise downward, she beheld that one of
  inconceivable intelligence—the minister of the lord of the tawny monkeys: the
  son of the Wind, like the sun risen upon the eastern mountain.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-first chapter of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the holy,
  illustrious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Account
  of Rāma’s Story (as heard).”
