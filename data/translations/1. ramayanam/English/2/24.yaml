  Now begins the twenty-fourth chapter in the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Consolation of Kausalyā in Her Distress.”
'1': >-
  Seeing him firmly resolved upon obeying his father’s command, Kausalyā—her
  voice choked with tears—spoke these words, righteous and full of dharma.
'2': >-
  A dharmic soul, one who has never known suffering, who speaks pleasingly for
  the good of all beings—how can such a son, born to me of Daśaratha, come to
  live by gleaning and scanty fare?
'3': >-
  He whose attendants and servants partake of well-prepared foods—how will that
  Rāma now eat in the forest, subsisting on roots and fruits?
'4': >-
  Who, hearing this, could possibly believe it? Or for whom would fear not
  arise—that the virtuous Kakutstha, beloved of the king, is being sent into
  exile?
'5': >-
  Surely, in this world, all-commanding Fate is mighty indeed—since you, the
  delight of the world, must go to the forest.
'6': >-
  This wind that comes from your presence and touches me has become, as it were,
  my fire of lamentation and grief, kindled with sorrow; my tears are its
  oblations, poured forth in weeping.
'7': >-
  The heavy smoke of that fire is my anxious thought—born from brooding over
  your coming and going; it afflicts me, my son, and arises from weary sighs and
  labored breathing.
'8': >-
  Deprived of you here, a great and incomparable fire of grief will utterly
  consume me, as a blazing fire consumes dry brush when winter has ended.
'9': >-
  How does a cow not follow her own calf as it goes away? So shall I follow you,
  wherever you go, my child.
'10': >-
  Hearing the words thus spoken by his mother, O bull among men, Rāma replied to
  his mother, who was exceedingly distressed.
'11': >-
  The king has been deceived by Kaikeyī; and if I take refuge in the forest and
  you too abandon him, surely he will not be able to go on living.
'12': >-
  To forsake one’s husband is indeed cruel for a woman—an act blameworthy even
  in thought; this must not be done by you.
'13': >-
  So long as my father, the lord of the earth, the Kakutstha king, yet lives—so
  long let service be rendered to him; for that is the eternal dharma.
'14': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, Kausalyā of auspicious appearance, well-pleased, said
  “So be it,” to Rāma, whose deeds were free from affliction and fault.
'15': >-
  But Rāma, best among uphold­ers of dharma, having thus spoken, again addressed
  words to his mother, who was deeply grieved.
'16': >-
  By me and by you alike, our father’s word must indeed be carried out. The king
  is husband, guru, foremost, the lord and master of all.
'17': >-
  Having dwelt in that great forest for nine years and five besides, I shall
  remain there with highest contentment, abiding by your counsel and his
  command.
'18': >-
  Thus spoken to by her beloved son, her face filled with tears,
  Kausalyā—supremely afflicted, and tender with love for her child—spoke.
'19': >-
  O Rāma, amid these co-wives of mine, I am not able to remain. Take me also, O
  Kakutstha, to the forest, like a wild doe of the woods.
'20': >-
  When she, thus weeping, spoke with her mind set on going for the sake of her
  husband’s claim and command, Rāma too, weeping, answered her.
'21': >-
  For a woman while she lives, her husband is her deity and her lord. For you
  and for me today, the king is the prevailing authority, the master.
'22': >-
  We are not without refuge while we have the king—wise and lord of the people.
  And Bharata also is righteous-souled, one who speaks kindly to all beings.
'23': >-
  He will attend upon you, for he is ever devoted to dharma; and though this
  grief is harsh, he will see to it that it does not destroy you.
'24': >-
  With a collected mind, ever act for the welfare of the aged king; that woman
  is the highest and best who is devoted to vows and fasting.
'25': >-
  She who does not follow and serve her husband comes to a sinful state; but by
  faithful service to her husband a woman attains the highest heaven.
'26': >-
  Even she who is without reverential salutations, who has turned away from the
  worship of the gods, should still render service to her husband—intent upon
  what is dear and beneficial to him.
'27': >-
  This is the perpetual dharma for a woman, proclaimed in the Veda and well
  known in the world, heard and remembered in tradition; and thus too, in sacred
  fire-rites, the deities are ever to be worshipped with a pleased and gracious
  mind.
'28': >-
  Therefore, O revered mother, let the gods be worshipped for my sake, and let
  brāhmaṇas too be duly honored. Wait thus for the time, longing for my return.
'29': >-
  Self-restrained, disciplined in food, devoted to serving your husband, you
  shall obtain your highest desire when I have come back again.
'30': >-
  If the foremost among uphold­ers of dharma can preserve his life—thus spoken
  to by Rāma, she stood with eyes troubled and flooded with tears.
'31': >-
  Kausalyā, tormented by grief for her son, spoke this word to Rāma: “I am not
  able, my child, to approve this resolve of yours to depart.
'32': >-
  Surely it is Time, hard to overcome, O hero, that compels it and prevents
  turning you back. Go then, my son, with mind set solely on your course; may
  welfare ever be yours, O mighty one.
'33': >-
  But when you return again, I shall be free from weariness. When you have come
  back, O greatly fortunate one—your vow fulfilled, your purpose
  accomplished—having discharged your debt to your father, then shall I sleep in
  supreme peace and happiness.
'34': >-
  The course of Fate, my son, is ever difficult to comprehend upon this
  earth—Fate which drives you on, O Rāghava, and pierces my heart with its goad
  through these words.
'35': >-
  Go now, O mighty-armed one, and return again in safety. You will gladden me,
  my son, with gentle, soft, and lovely words of conciliation.
'36': >-
  Would that the time might now already be at hand when, returned from the
  forest, I might behold you, my child, wearing matted hair and bark garments.
'37': >-
  Thus the देवी (queen) beheld Rāma, firmly resolved to dwell in the forest,
  with a mind of the deepest understanding; she spoke to Rāma of auspicious
  marks words befitting him, and she became intent upon his well-being and safe
  journey.
'38': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fourth chapter of the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa in the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic, entitled “The Consolation of Kausalyā in
  Her Distress.”
