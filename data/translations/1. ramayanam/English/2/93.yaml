  Then, in the holy and glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins
  the ninety-third canto, entitled “The Viewing of the Forest of Chitrakūṭa.”
'1': >-
  By that great marching host, with its standards and banners, the dwellers of
  the forest were afflicted; the intoxicated leaders of the herds, together with
  their companies, fled in confusion.
'2': >-
  Bears, herds of spotted deer, and antelopes spread out in all directions; they
  were to be seen amid the forest stretches, upon the mountains, and along the
  rivers as well.
'3': >-
  Then the righteous-souled son of Daśaratha set forth, rejoicing, surrounded by
  a great, resounding fourfold army.
'4': >-
  That army of the great-souled Bharata, like the surge of the ocean, covered
  the earth, even as in the rainy season a mass of clouds covers the sky.
'5': >-
  It is understood that for a long time he went on thus, until at some point
  signs began to be perceived, indicating that the place was nearing.
'6': >-
  Having gone a long way, with his conveyances utterly wearied, the illustrious
  Bharata addressed Vasiṣṭha, the foremost among counsellors.
'7': >-
  “Such as the appearance now seems, and as indeed I had heard—plainly we have
  reached that region of which Bharadvāja spoke to me.”
'8': >-
  “This is Mount Chitrakūṭa; this is the river Mandākinī; and yonder forest,
  dark like a blue cloud, is seen shining from afar.”
'9': >-
  “Now the lovely slopes of Chitrakūṭa are being trodden and crushed by my
  elephants, huge as mountains.”
'10': >-
  “Those trees on the mountain-slopes are letting fall their blossoms; and the
  blue ones—when the heat of the sun declines—resemble rain-bearing clouds laden
  with water.”
'11': >-
  “Behold, Śatrughna, this mountain region, frequented by Kinnaras, and filled
  on every side with deer, like the ocean with crocodiles.”
'12': >-
  “These herds of deer appear splendid—swift of speed when driven onward—like
  streaks of cloud in the autumn sky, hurled along by the wind.”
'13': >-
  “They make fragrant wreaths of flowers upon their heads, as southern folk do,
  with plates gleaming like clouds.”
'14': >-
  “This forest—grim to behold—having become as it were without birdsong, now
  appears to me like Ayodhyā itself, crowded with people.”
'15': >-
  “The dust raised by hoofs hangs, veiling the sky; the wind swiftly carries it
  along, as though doing what is pleasing to me.”
'16': >-
  “See, Śatrughna, these chariots yoked with horses, guided by chief
  charioteers, rushing swiftly through the wood.”
'17': >-
  “See these peacocks, fair to look upon, terrified; see too the birds quickly
  entering their resting-places.”
'18': >-
  “This region appears to me exceedingly delightful beyond measure; it is
  plainly the dwelling of ascetics, like a pathway to heaven.”
'19': >-
  “Many deer in the forest, accompanied by does, and many spotted deer, of
  pleasing form, are seen—adorned as though painted with flowers.”
'20': >-
  “Let the good army halt; and let them search within the wood, so that those
  two tiger-like men—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—may be seen.”
'21': >-
  Hearing Bharata’s words, the men, weapons in hand, the valiant entered that
  forest and then beheld smoke there.
'22': >-
  Having looked upon the foremost crest of smoke, those men returned to Bharata
  and said: “This is a fire not made by men; clearly the two Rāghavas are right
  here.”
'23': >-
  “For the two tiger-like men—the princes, scorchers of foes—are not here; I
  think it is plainly ascetics, resembling Rāma, who are here.”
'24': >-
  Hearing that statement of theirs, approved by the good, Bharata, crusher of
  the enemy’s strength, addressed all those troops.
'25': >-
  “Let all of you remain alert and stay where you are; none should go forward. I
  alone shall go, and Sumantra, and the venerable preceptor as well.”
'26': >-
  Thus addressed, they all remained there on every side; and Bharata fixed his
  gaze upon the place where the crest of smoke was seen.
'27': >-
  That host, stationed as Bharata had arranged it, though still looking toward
  the smoke ahead, soon became gladdened, for it understood that then the
  meeting with beloved Rāma was at hand.
'28': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-third canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Viewing of the Forest of Chitrakūṭa.”
