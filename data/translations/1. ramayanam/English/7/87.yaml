  Now begins the eighty-seventh canto in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Gaining of Womanhood by Ilā.”
'1': >-
  Having heard the words spoken by Lakṣmaṇa, Rāghava—mighty in splendor and well
  skilled in speech—smilingly replied with words in return.
'2': >-
  “Even so, O best of men, just as you say, Lakṣmaṇa—tell in full of Vṛtra’s
  slaying and also of the fruit of the Aśvamedha sacrifice that accrued
  therefrom.”
'3': >-
  “For it is heard, dear one, that in former times there was a son of Prajāpati
  Kardama—illustrious, high-souled—named Ilā, a lord of Bāhlī.”
'4': >-
  “That king, having brought the whole earth under his sway, being truly
  righteous, protected his kingdom like a son, O tiger among men.”
'5': >-
  “By the most generous devas, by the very wealthy daityas, by nāgas, rākṣasas,
  gandharvas, and by great-souled yakṣas—”
'6': >-
  “—he was honored continually, O gentle one, O delight of the Raghus; and the
  three worlds stood in fear of that great-souled one when he was wrathful.”
'7': >-
  “Such was that king—steadfast in dharma and in valor, and supremely noble in
  intellect—Ilā, lord of Bāhlī, of great renown.”
'8': >-
  “That mighty-armed one undertook the chase in a beautiful forest, in the
  delightful month of Caitra, along with his attendants, forces, and mounts.”
'9': >-
  “In the wilderness the king slew deer by hundreds and thousands; yet even
  after killing, no satisfaction arose in that great-souled monarch.”
'10': >-
  “As countless kinds of beasts, ten thousand in number, were being slain by
  that great-souled king, he came upon the region where Mahāsena (Kārttikeya)
  was born.”
'11': >-
  “In that very tract, O lord of the gods, Hara, the unconquerable one, sported
  with the daughter of the king of mountains, together with all his attendants.”
'12': >-
  “There Umā’s lord—he who bears the bull as his banner, the leader of the
  hosts—having assumed the form of a woman, desiring to please the goddess,
  stayed in that mountain-cascade.”
'13': >-
  “And those beings in that part of the forest who were spoken of as
  ‘males’—trees as well, that bore masculine names—then became womenfolk.”
'14': >-
  “Whatever there was—everything without exception—came to be designated as
  female. In the meantime, that king Ilā, the son of Kardama, while slaying
  thousands of deer, entered that region.”
'15': >-
  “He beheld that all was made female there—together with its serpents, beasts,
  and birds—and he beheld himself too made female, along with his followers, O
  joy of the Raghus.”
'16': >-
  “Great was his sorrow on seeing himself thus transformed; and, understanding
  that it was the deed of Umāpati (Śiva), he was seized with fear.”
'17': >-
  “Then the king, with his attendants, forces, and mounts, went for refuge to
  that great-souled god—Śitikaṇṭha, the matted-haired Kapardin.”
'18': >-
  “Then the great lord, Maheśvara, the bestower of boons, smiling together with
  the goddess, himself spoke these words to the son of Prajāpati.”
'19': >-
  “‘Rise, rise, O royal seer, O Kārḍameya of great strength. Except for manhood,
  dear one, choose some boon—O man of excellent vows.’”
'20': >-
  “But that king, afflicted with grief, having been refused by the great-souled
  deity, did not accept—though turned into a woman—any other boon from the
  foremost of the gods.”
'21': >-
  “Then, overwhelmed with great sorrow, the king bowed down to Umā, the daughter
  of the king of mountains, prostrating with his whole inner being.”
'22': >-
  “‘O fair lady, bestower of boons, you are the sovereign giver of boons for the
  worlds. O goddess of unfailing vision, look upon me with gentle eyes.’”
'23': >-
  “Knowing what lay in the heart of that royal seer, in Hara’s presence, the
  goddess—approved by Rudra—answered him with auspicious words.”
'24': >-
  “‘The god is the giver of boons for half, and for the other half it is I who
  grant. Therefore, take from me half: be woman and man, according to your
  wish.’”
'25': >-
  “Hearing that supreme boon from the goddess—more wondrous than wondrous—his
  mind filled with delight, the king then spoke.”
'26': >-
  “‘If, O goddess, you are pleased with me—whose form is matchless on earth—then
  let me live a month as a woman, and again a month as a man.’”
'27': >-
  “Knowing his desire, the goddess of very lovely countenance replied with
  auspicious words: ‘Even so; it shall be so.’”
'28': >-
  “‘O king, when you are in manhood you will not remember the state of
  womanhood; and when you have become a woman for a full month, you will not
  remember manhood.’”
'29': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-seventh canto of the Uttara Kāṇḍa in the sacred
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Gaining of Womanhood by
  Ilā.”
