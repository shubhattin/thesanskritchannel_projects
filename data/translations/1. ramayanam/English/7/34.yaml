  Now begins the thirty-fourth canto in the Uttara-Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Friendship of Vāli and Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  But Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, having been released by Arjuna, wandered
  over the entire earth, remaining unwearied and undepressed in spirit.
'2': >-
  Whenever he heard of any being—whether rākṣasa or man—who was superior in
  strength, the haughty Rāvaṇa would approach him and challenge him to battle.
'3': >-
  Then, on a certain occasion, he went to Kiṣkindhā, that city protected by
  Vāli, and challenged Vāli—who wore a garland of gold—to fight.
'4': >-
  Thereupon Tārā’s father, the lord Tārā, chief minister of the vānaras, spoke
  these words to the one who had come desiring battle:
'5': >-
  “O lord of rākṣasas, Vāli—who would be a match for your strength—has gone
  away. Which other monkey is capable of standing before you in the forefront?”
'6': >-
  “O Rāvaṇa, after performing the twilight worship at the four seas, Vāli will
  return within this very muhūrta. Wait only for a short while.”
'7': >-
  “Behold these heaps of bones, white as conch-shells. These are the remains of
  those who sought battle, O king, slain by the splendor and might of the lord
  of monkeys.”
'8': >-
  “Or else, O Rāvaṇa the rākṣasa, if you have drunk the nectar of
  immortality—then indeed, upon coming face to face with Vāli, the end of your
  life will be there.”
'9': >-
  “See now this wondrous spectacle, O son of Viśravas. Remain here for this
  muhūrta; for it will be hard for you to find such an occasion again.”
'10': >-
  “Or, if you are in haste to die, go to the southern ocean. There you shall
  behold Vāli, blazing upon the ground like fire itself.”
'11': >-
  But Rāvaṇa, the terror of the worlds, rebuked Tārā; then, mounting that
  Puṣpaka chariot, he set out for the southern sea.
'12': >-
  There he saw Vāli—like a golden mountain, with a face resembling the rising
  young sun—intent upon the worship at twilight.
'13': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa, dark as collyrium, descended from Puṣpaka and, in order to seize
  Vāli swiftly, approached with noiseless steps.
'14': >-
  By chance, that Rāvaṇa was also seen by Vāli. Seeing his sinful intent, Vāli
  did not become agitated in the least.
'15': >-
  As a lion, on noticing a hare, or as Garuḍa a serpent, gives it no anxious
  thought—so Vāli gave no thought to Rāvaṇa, whose resolve was evil.
'16': >-
  “I shall make this evil-minded Rāvaṇa, who is coming to seize me, hang from my
  armpit, and then I shall go to the three great oceans.”
'17': >-
  “They shall see my enemy lying on my lap, his thigh-cloth slipping down from
  his hips, the ten-necked one hanging—like a serpent in the grasp of Garuḍa.”
'18': >-
  Having thus formed his resolve, Vāli—his ear adorned—stood firm like a king
  among mountains, murmuring the mantras of the Vedas.
'19': >-
  Thus those two—the monkey-king and the rākṣasa-king—each eager to seize the
  other, strove with all effort in that act, arrogant in their strength.
'20': >-
  Judging from the sound of footsteps that it was Rāvaṇa coming to seize him,
  Vāli, though facing away, caught him as a bird of prey seizes a serpent.
'21': >-
  Seizing the rākṣasa-lord who had intended to seize him, the monkey leapt up
  into the sky with speed, making him hang at his side from the armpit.
'22': >-
  Though Rāvaṇa pressed against him and again and again pierced him with his
  nails, Vāli carried him off, as the wind bears away a cloud.
'23': >-
  Then the rākṣasa ministers, seeing the ten-faced one being carried away,
  rushed upon Vāli with cries, wishing to set Rāvaṇa free.
'24': >-
  Followed by them, Vāli shone in the midst of the sky, like the sun in the
  heavens surrounded by masses of clouds.
'25': >-
  But those foremost of rākṣasas, unable to overtake Vāli, stood still,
  exhausted by the swift force of his arms and thighs.
'26': >-
  They fell away from Vāli’s path—since he went like the lord of mountains in
  majesty; how much more so when their very lives were dear to them, while he
  bore flesh and blood (the captive enemy)?
'27': >-
  The mighty swift monkey-king, scattering flocks of birds as he went, paid
  homage in due order to the twilight at all the oceans.
'28': >-
  Honored by beings moving through the sky—he who was foremost among such
  sky-goers—Vāli, carrying Rāvaṇa, reached the western ocean.
'29': >-
  There, having performed the twilight worship, bathed, and recited his prayers,
  the monkey proceeded to the northern ocean, bearing the ten-faced one.
'30': >-
  Bearing him across many thousands of yojanas, that great monkey went with his
  enemy as swiftly as the wind—and as swiftly as thought.
'31': >-
  At the northern ocean too, having performed the twilight worship while bearing
  the ten-faced one, Vāli then went on to the eastern great sea.
'32': >-
  There also, having observed the twilight worship, Vāli, the lord of monkeys,
  took Rāvaṇa and returned again toward Kiṣkindhā.
'33': >-
  Thus, after observing the twilight rites at all four oceans, the
  monkey—wearied by carrying Rāvaṇa—fell down in a grove near Kiṣkindhā.
'34': >-
  Then the best of monkeys released Rāvaṇa from his armpit and, laughing again
  and again, said to him: “Who are you?”
'35': >-
  Overcome with great astonishment, his eyes unsteady from fatigue, the lord of
  rākṣasas spoke these words to that king of monkeys:
'36': >-
  “O king of monkeys, resembling Mahendra, I am Rāvaṇa, lord of rākṣasas.
  Desiring battle, I came here—and today I have been confronted by you.”
'37': >-
  “Ah, what strength! Ah, what valor! Ah, and what depth of power as well—by
  which I, like a beast, was seized and made to roam the four oceans.”
'38': >-
  “O hero, carrying me too, you traversed the great oceans swiftly indeed, as
  though you were not fatigued at all. What other warrior could do the like?”
'39': >-
  “This range of motion belongs only to three kinds of beings, O monkey: to the
  mind, to the wind, and to Suparṇa (Garuḍa)—and to you as well; of this there
  is no doubt.”
'40': >-
  “Therefore, having seen your strength, I desire, O bull among monkeys, a
  long-lasting friendship with you—most affectionate—before the consecrated
  fire.”
'41': >-
  “Wives, sons, city, kingdom, and all enjoyments—clothing and food—everything
  shall be shared between us without division, O lord of monkeys.”
'42': >-
  Then the two—monkey and rākṣasa—kindled the fire; and having entered into
  brotherhood, they embraced one another.
'43': >-
  Thereafter those two, the monkey and the rākṣasa, with arms laid upon each
  other, joyfully entered Kiṣkindhā, like two lions entering a mountain cave.
'44': >-
  There Rāvaṇa dwelt for a month, like Sugrīva himself; and then, when his
  ministers came seeking the destruction of the three worlds, he was led away by
  them.
'45': >-
  “Thus, O lord, this is what happened in former times: Rāvaṇa was humbled by
  Vāli and was also made his brother in the presence of the sacred fire.”
'46': >-
  “Matchless indeed, O Rāma, was the unsurpassed strength of Vāli. Yet even he
  was burned up by you, like a moth by a flame.”
'47': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fourth canto in the Uttara-Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Friendship of Vāli and Rāvaṇa.”
