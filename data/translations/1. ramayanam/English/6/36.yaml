  Now begins the thirty-sixth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Guarding of the City Gates.”
'1': >-
  But Rāvaṇa, the Ten-headed one, a wicked-souled being who had come under the
  dominion of Time (Fate), could not endure that wholesome counsel which
  Mālyavān had spoken for his good.
'2': >-
  Then, knitting his brows upon his face and coming under the power of wrath,
  with eyes rolling about in intolerance, he spoke to Mālyavān.
'3': >-
  “With the intention of offering what is beneficial, you utter harsh words that
  are in truth harmful—having, as it were, entered the enemy’s side. This is not
  something that should have reached my ears.”
'4': >-
  “That Rāma is a mere human, a wretched man—alone, taking refuge like a monkey
  on a branch—abandoned by his father and dwelling in the forest. By what
  reasoning do you consider him competent (to do anything against me)?”
'5': >-
  “I am the lord of the Rākṣasas, and a terror even to the gods. By what reason
  do you deem me deficient—me who am not deficient in any of my valour and
  prowess?”
'6': >-
  “I suspect you have spoken these harsh words to me either out of hatred for
  heroes, or out of partiality toward the enemy, or else with the aim of
  encouraging my foe.”
'7': >-
  “Who would address with harsh speech one who is powerful and firmly
  established in his station—who, being learned and knowing the true purport of
  the śāstras, would do so without some instigation?”
'8': >-
  “Having brought Sītā from the forest—like Fortune (Śrī) deprived of her
  lotus—why should I give her back, out of fear of Rāghava?”
'9': >-
  “Though he is surrounded by crores of Vānaras, together with Sugrīva and
  Lakṣmaṇa—behold, in but a few days I shall have slain Rāghava!”
'10': >-
  “He before whom even the gods do not stand firm in battle and in single
  combat—how then would that Rāvaṇa ever bring fear upon the battlefield?”
'11': >-
  “Even if I were split in two in this manner, I still would not bow to anyone.
  This is my inborn fault—my nature, difficult to transgress.”
'12': >-
  “If indeed a bridge has been built across the ocean by Rāma, merely by
  chance—what cause for amazement is there in that, by which fear has come upon
  you?”
'13': >-
  “But once Rāma has crossed the ocean together with the Vānara host, I swear to
  you in truth—he will not return alive.”
'14': >-
  Knowing Rāvaṇa to be enraged and speaking thus in agitation, Mālyavān,
  ashamed, offered no reply.
'15': >-
  Having duly honoured the king with blessings for victory, Mālyavān—dismissed
  with permission—went to his own dwelling.
'16': >-
  Rāvaṇa then, together with his ministers, having deliberated and reflected,
  caused the defences and guarding of Laṅkā to be arranged at that time.
'17': >-
  He appointed Prahasta, the Rākṣasa, at the eastern gate; and at the southern
  gate the two of great valour—Mahāpārśva and Mahodara.
'18': >-
  Then at the western gate he appointed his son Indrajit, possessed of great
  powers of illusion, surrounded by many Rākṣasas.
'19': >-
  At the northern city-gate he stationed Śuka and Sāraṇa; and he said to those
  ministers, “I myself shall go here as well.”
'20': >-
  And the Rākṣasa named Virūpākṣa, of great heroism and prowess, he placed in
  the central division (reserve) together with many other Rākṣasas.
'21': >-
  Thus, having made these arrangements in Laṅkā, the foremost of Rākṣasas—driven
  on by Time—considered himself as though his task were accomplished.
'22': >-
  Thereafter, having commanded abundant provisions and dispositions for the
  city, he dismissed his ministers; and honoured by the assembly of ministers
  with blessings of victory, he entered his mighty inner palace, rich in
  splendour and prosperity.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-sixth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, called “The Guarding of the City Gates.”
