  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa—within the Uttara-kāṇḍa—begins the
  thirty-third chapter, named “The Releasing of Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  That seizure of Rāvaṇa was like the capturing of the wind itself. Thereafter
  Pulastya heard, as it was proclaimed by the gods in heaven, the full account
  of that event.
'2': >-
  Then the great sage—steadfast in immense fortitude, yet shaken because of
  affection for his descendant—came to behold the lord of Māhiṣmatī.
'3': >-
  That brāhmaṇa, taking the path of the wind and moving with wind-like speed,
  reached the city of Māhiṣmatī, possessing the prowess of a swift flight of the
  mind.
'4': >-
  He entered that city—splendid like Amarāvatī, crowded with delighted and
  prosperous people—like Brahmā entering Indra’s Amarāvatī.
'5': >-
  Seeing him come forth in dreadful majesty—like the sun rising and
  blazing—those people recognized him and reported the matter to Arjuna.
'6': >-
  Knowing from their words that it was Pulastya, the sovereign of the Haihayas
  went out to meet the ascetic, placing joined palms upon his head in reverence.
'7': >-
  His household priest went ahead of the king carrying the
  welcome-offering—arghya and madhuparka—like Bṛhaspati going before Śakra
  (Indra).
'8': >-
  Then Arjuna, seeing that ṛṣi approaching—like the rising sun—became agitated
  with awe and bowed to him, as Indra bows to the Supreme Lord.
'9': >-
  Having offered him madhuparka, a cow, water for washing the feet, and arghya,
  the best of kings addressed Pulastya with words choked with joy.
'10': >-
  “Today Māhiṣmatī has been made equal to Amarāvatī, because today, O foremost
  of twice-born, I behold you—so difficult to behold.”
'11': >-
  “Today my welfare is secured, O divine one; today my vow is successful. Today
  my birth has borne fruit; today my austerity has borne fruit—since I worship
  your feet, you who are adored by the hosts of gods.”
'12': >-
  “This kingdom, these sons, these wives, and we ourselves are here. O Brahman,
  what shall I do, what is to be done? Command us.”
'13': >-
  After inquiring of the king about his righteousness, his sacred fires, his
  sons, and his well-being, Pulastya spoke to that lord of the earth—Arjuna
  among the Haihayas:
'14': >-
  “O king, lotus-petalled-eyed, with a face like the full moon—matchless is your
  strength, by which the ten-necked one was conquered by you.”
'15': >-
  “He before whom, out of fear, the ocean and the wind would stand
  motionless—he, my grandson, invincible in battle—has been bound by you in
  combat.”
'16': >-
  “You have drunk up the glory of my child, and made your own name resound.
  Therefore, being petitioned today by my word, release the dear
  child—Daśānana.”
'17': >-
  Receiving Pulastya’s command, Arjuna spoke not a single word; the lord among
  kings released the lord of the rākṣasas, as though in gladness.
'18': >-
  Having thus set him free, Arjuna—enemy of the gods—honoured him with divine
  ornaments, garlands, and garments. Entering into a friendship that was
  harmless and sanctioned by sacred fire, he bowed to that son of Brahmā and
  then went to his home.
'19': >-
  The mighty lord of the rākṣasas, though let go by Pulastya, had been embraced,
  duly received as a guest, and yet—conquered—departed in shame.
'20': >-
  And Pulastya, the great sage—son of Pitāmaha (Brahmā)—having obtained the
  release of Daśagrīva, indeed went to the world of Brahmā.
'21': >-
  Thus did Rāvaṇa suffer humiliation at the hands of Kārtavīrya, and thus—by
  Pulastya’s word—was that mighty one released again.
'22': >-
  Thus, O delight of the Raghus, there are those stronger than the strong. One
  should not show contempt toward others, if one desires what is dear to
  oneself.
'23': >-
  Thereafter that king of the flesh-eaters (rākṣasas), having obtained
  friendship with the thousand-armed one, again caused the slaughter of kings
  and ranged over the whole earth in arrogance.
'24': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-third chapter, named “The Releasing of Rāvaṇa,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
