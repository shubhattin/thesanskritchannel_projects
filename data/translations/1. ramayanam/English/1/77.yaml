  Now begins the seventy-seventh sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Entry into Ayodhyā.”
'1': >-
  When Rāma (Bhārgava) had departed, the illustrious Rāma, son of Daśaratha—his
  mind tranquil—placed that bow into the hands of Varuṇa, the immeasurable (lord
  of the waters).
'2': >-
  Thereafter Rāma (son of Daśaratha), having saluted Vasiṣṭha and the other
  foremost ṛṣis, and seeing his father shaken and distraught, spoke these
  words—O delight of the Raghu line.
'3': >-
  “Rāma of Jamadagni’s line has gone. Let the fourfold army set forth, and let
  the host, protected under your lordship, proceed facing Ayodhyā.”
'4': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, King Daśaratha embraced his son with both arms and,
  smelling the crown of Rāghava’s head, (held him close in affection).
'5': >-
  On hearing, “Rāma has gone,” the king was delighted and exceedingly gladdened;
  then he deemed both his son and himself as though born again.
'6': >-
  He then urged that army onward and quickly went to the city—lovely with its
  lines of flags and banners, and resounding with the clamour of trumpets and
  instruments.
'7': >-
  (The city was) charming with its royal highways sprinkled with water, strewn
  with heaps of scattered flowers, and with the citizens of auspicious
  countenance holding auspicious offerings in their hands for the king’s entry.
'8': >-
  The king entered (Ayodhyā), filled and adorned with throngs of people; the
  citizens had come out a long way to welcome him, as had the twice-born and the
  residents of the city.
'9': >-
  Followed by his illustrious sons, and by prosperous and renowned men, the king
  entered his beloved palace, dear to him and lofty like Himavat.
'10': >-
  The king rejoiced with his own people, honoured well in his home with all
  desirable enjoyments; and (there were) Kauśalyā, Sumitrā, and Kaikeyī of
  slender waist,
'11': >-
  and the other royal ladies, all intent upon receiving the brides. Then (came)
  the most fortunate Sītā, and the renowned Ūrmilā,
'12': >-
  both daughters of Kuśadhvaja, whom the royal women received—clad in linen
  garments, adorned with auspicious greetings and with homa rites.
'13': >-
  All of them quickly performed worship to the shrines of the gods, repeatedly
  offering reverent salutations; and then all those princesses (the new brides)
  also exchanged salutations in due form.
'14': >-
  All of them, rejoicing, took their delight privately with their husbands—made
  householders (now wedded), accomplished in arms, endowed with wealth, and
  possessed of friends and well-wishers.
'15': >-
  Serving their father and conducting themselves accordingly, those best of men
  (the princes) lived on. Then, after some time had passed, King Daśaratha said
  to his son—
'16': >-
  to Bharata, Kaikeyī’s son, O delight of the Raghu line: “Child, the son of the
  king of Kekaya is staying (here),”
'17': >-
  “and your maternal uncle, the heroic Yudhājit, has come to take you (with
  him).” Hearing this from Daśaratha, Bharata, Kaikeyī’s son,
'18': >-
  prepared then to depart together with Śatrughna, and, having taken leave of
  his father—the valiant one—and also of Rāma of unwearied deeds,
'19': >-
  and of his mothers as well, that best of men went forth with Śatrughna.
  Yudhājit, having obtained Bharata along with Śatrughna, was filled with joy,
'20': >-
  and the hero entered his own city; and Bharata’s grandfather (the father
  there) was pleased. And when Bharata had gone, Rāma and mighty-armed Lakṣmaṇa,
'21': >-
  then paid honour to their father, radiant like a god; and, keeping their
  father’s command foremost, (they attended to) all the civic duties in every
  respect.
'22': >-
  Rāma performed all that was dear and also beneficial (to the people). Having
  carried out the duties toward his mothers, with the utmost self-control,
'23': >-
  he attended, from time to time, to the duties toward the gurus, at the proper
  occasions. Thus Daśaratha was pleased, and so too were the brāhmaṇas and the
  guildsmen/merchants (of the city),
'24': >-
  and all the inhabitants of the realm, by the conduct and character of Rāma. By
  that great fame of his in the world, Rāma—whose valour was true to his word—
'25': >-
  became, for all beings, like the Self-born (Brahmā) himself, preeminent in
  excellence. And Rāma, together with Sītā, sported through many seasons,
'26': >-
  the high-souled one—his mind fixed on her, his heart wholly given over to her.
  And Sītā was dear to Rāma, (being) his wife as arranged by his father,
'27': >-
  and moreover, because of her virtues and the beauty of her form, his love
  increased still more and more. And in her heart too, her husband turned
  (abided) doubly dear,
'28': >-
  for heart makes known to heart even what lies hidden within, and each clearly
  understands the other. And especially did Mithilī, Janaka’s daughter—Sītā,
  like Śrī herself embodied, equal to the goddesses in beauty—(shine forth).
'29': >-
  United with that supremely desirable princess, the excellent royal maiden whom
  he loved, the son of the royal ṛṣis (Rāma) shone exceedingly, filled with
  joy—like mighty Viṣṇu, lord of the immortals, radiant with splendour.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-seventh sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa in the sacred,
  illustrious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first poem, entitled “The Entry
  into Ayodhyā.”
