  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the sixteenth
  chapter, called “The Description of the Hemanta (early winter) season.”
'1': >-
  Then Raghunandana (Rāma), proceeding towards Pañcavaṭī on the way, came upon a
  huge-bodied vulture, terrible in prowess and dreadful in valour.
'2': >-
  Seeing him, those two illustrious brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, dwelling in the
  forest, deemed that bird to be a rākṣasa, and they addressed him, saying, “Who
  are you?”
'3': >-
  Then, as though gladdening them, he spoke in a sweet and gentle voice: “Dear
  child, know me to be the friend of your father in spirit.”
'4': >-
  Rāghava, taking him to be his father’s friend, paid him honour; and then, with
  mind unconfused, he asked him of his lineage and also of his name.
'5': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, the twice-born one declared to him his lineage and his
  own origin—the source of all beings.
'6': >-
  “In former times, O mighty-armed one, there were the Prajāpatis. Hear from me,
  O Rāghava, as I recount them all from the beginning.
'7': >-
  Kardama was the first among them; after him was Vikṛta; then Śeṣa and
  Saṃśraya; and the valiant Bahuputra.
'8': >-
  Then came Sthāṇu, Marīci, Atri, and the great and mighty Kratu; also Pulastya
  and Aṅgiras; Pracetā, and likewise Pulaha.
'9': >-
  Dakṣa, Vivasvān, and another named Ariṣṭanemi, O Rāghava; and the
  great-tejasvī Kaśyapa was the last among them.
'10': >-
  Of that Prajāpati Dakṣa, it is renowned, O Rāma of great glory, that there
  were sixty daughters, illustrious and widely famed.
'11': >-
  Kaśyapa accepted eight of them of fair waist: Aditi, Diti, and Danu, and
  Kālakā as well;
'12': >-
  Tāmrā, and Krodhavaśā, and Manu, and also Anala. Then Kaśyapa, pleased, spoke
  again to those maidens:
'13': >-
  ‘You shall beget sons—lords of the three worlds—equal to me.’ Aditi, O Rāma,
  set her mind upon that; and so did Diti and Danu indeed,
'14': >-
  and Kālakā, O mighty-armed one; but the others were not so disposed. From
  Aditi were born the thirty-three gods, O subduer of foes.
'15': >-
  The Ādityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, and the two Aśvins, O scorcher of enemies.
  But Diti bore famed sons—the Daityas, dear child.
'16': >-
  In their time this earth had formerly been rich with forests and oceans. But
  Danu bore a son named Aśvagrīva, O subduer of foes.
'17': >-
  And Kālakā bore Naraka and Kālakā; and Kālakā too brought forth Krauñcī,
  Bhāsī, and Śyenī, and Dhṛtarāṣṭrī, and Śukī.
'18': >-
  But Tāmrā brought forth five daughters—these, renowned in the worlds. Krauñcī
  gave birth to owls; Bhāsī gave birth to bhāsas (a kind of bird of prey).
'19': >-
  Śyenī gave birth to hawks and to vultures, radiant with great splendour.
  Dhṛtarāṣṭrī, however, in every way gave birth to swans and to ruddy swans
  (kala-haṃsas).
'20': >-
  And she, the comely one, also bore cakravāka birds—may it be well with you.
  Śukī bore Natā; and from Natā was born Vinatā, her daughter.
'21': >-
  Krodhavaśā, O Rāma, bore ten daughters, born of herself: Mṛgī, Mṛgamandā,
  Harī, and Bhadrāmadā as well;
'22': >-
  then Mātaṅgī, and Śārdūlī, and Śvetā, and also Surabhī; and Surasā, possessed
  of all auspicious marks, and Kadrūkā too.
'23': >-
  From Mṛgī came all the deer, O best of men. From Mṛgamandā came bears; and
  also sṛmaras and camaras.
'24': >-
  Then Bhadrāmadā bore a daughter named Irāvatī. And her son was Airāvata—the
  great elephant, lord of the worlds.
'25': >-
  From Harī came the troop of apes and the ascetic vānaras; and Śārdūlī bore
  sons—tigers and the long-tailed ones (golāṅgūlas).
'26': >-
  From Mātaṅgī came the elephants as offspring, O bull among men. And Śvetā bore
  the quarter-elephant (one of the elephants of the directions), O Kākuṭstha.
'27': >-
  Then Surabhī, O Rāma—may it be well with you—bore two daughters: one named
  Rohiṇī, and the other, the illustrious Gandharvī.
'28': >-
  Rohiṇī bore cows; Gandharvī bore horses as her sons. Surasā bore nāgas, O
  Rāma, and Kadrū bore pannagas (serpents).
'29': >-
  Manu, of great soul and Kaśyapa’s (wife), begot mankind—brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas,
  vaiśyas, and śūdras, O best of men.
'30': >-
  From the mouth brāhmaṇas were born; from the chest kṣatriyas likewise; from
  the thighs were born vaiśyas; and from the feet śūdras—so it is heard in
  śruti.
'31': >-
  Anala also bore all trees that yield sacred merit and fruit. And
  Vinatā—granddaughter of Śukī—and Kadrū, sister of Surasā,
'32': >-
  Kadrū bore a thousand nāgas, mighty supporters of the earth. But to Vinatā
  there were two sons—Garuḍa and Aruṇa.
'33': >-
  From that Aruṇa was I born, and my elder brother is Sampāti. Know me as
  Jaṭāyu, O subduer of foes—the son of Śyenī.
'34': >-
  “If you wish, I shall be a companion and helper to you in your dwelling. For
  this wilderness is hard to pass, frequented by beasts and rākṣasas. And, dear
  child, I shall protect Sītā when you go forth with Lakṣmaṇa.”
'35': >-
  Honouring Jaṭāyu, Rāghava, with joy, embraced him and bowed in reverence. For
  again and again the self-possessed Rāma heard from Jaṭāyu the account of his
  friendship with his father.
'36': >-
  There, having entrusted Maithilī Sītā to that exceedingly strong bird, he went
  on to Pañcavaṭī with Lakṣmaṇa—desiring to consume his foes, like fire
  consuming moths.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the sixteenth chapter, called “The Description of Hemanta (early
  winter),” in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
