  Now begins the twenty-first canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Battle between Yama and Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Thus reflecting, that foremost of Brahmins, swift in prowess, went to the
  abode of Yama, to relate exactly as it had occurred.
'2': >-
  There he beheld Yama, the god, with Agni set before him; and he saw the
  ordinance by which Yama apportions to beings their due according to what they
  have done.
'3': >-
  And Yama, seeing the great sage Nārada arrived there, spoke to him as he sat
  at ease, offering him arghya in accordance with dharma.
'4': >-
  “Is it well with you, O divine sage? Does dharma not wane? What business
  brings you here, O one attended by Devas and Gandharvas?”
'5': >-
  Then the blessed sage Nārada spoke these words: “Hear me; I shall declare it,
  and let due measures also be ordained.”
'6': >-
  “This rākṣasa named Daśagrīva has come, O Lord of the Pitṛs, seeking by his
  prowess to bring even you—so hard to conquer—under his control.”
'7': >-
  “For this reason I have hastened here, O Lord. What, indeed, will come to pass
  today for you, the wielder of the staff of punishment?”
'8': >-
  Meanwhile, from afar, they saw the rākṣasa’s aerial car approaching, blazing
  like the risen sun, Aṁśumān.
'9': >-
  That mighty one, the Puṣpaka, making the entire region free of darkness by its
  radiance, drew near.
'10': >-
  Then Daśagrīva, the great-armed, beheld here and there beings enjoying the
  fruit of their meritorious deeds, and others tasting the result of evil deeds.
'11': >-
  He also saw the forces of Yama together with his attendants—Yama’s grim,
  dreadful, and fearsome servants.
'12': >-
  He saw embodied beings being slain and tormented, crying out with a great
  roar, intent on fierce wailing.
'13': He saw some being eaten by worms, and by terrible dogs as well.
'14': >-
  He heard frightening cries that distressed the ears; and he saw beings again
  and again being made to cross the Vaitaraṇī, whose waters were thick with
  blood.
'15': >-
  He saw the unrighteous being scorched repeatedly upon burning sands, and being
  torn in the forest of sword-leaves (asipatravana).
'16': >-
  He saw them in the Raurava hell, in the river of caustic brine, and upon
  razor-edges; and he saw even those tormented by thirst and hunger begging for
  water.
'17': >-
  He saw some as if become corpses—emaciated, wretched, pale, their hair
  loosened; miserable, coated with filth and mire, rough and ragged, running
  about.
'18': >-
  And on the way, Rāvaṇa saw by hundreds and by thousands others—some in
  excellent mansions—rejoicing amidst the sounds of song and instruments; these
  he recognized as those who, by their own good deeds, were enjoying delight.
'19': >-
  Those who had given cows were enjoying milk and curds; those who had given
  food were enjoying food; and those who had given houses were dwelling in
  houses—each eating the fruit of his own actions.
'20': >-
  He saw them adorned with lovely women ornamented with gold, jewels, and
  pearls.
'21': >-
  And the mighty-armed Rāvaṇa, lord of rākṣasas, beheld there other righteous
  ones, shining with their own splendor.
'22': >-
  Then that powerful one, Rāvaṇa, by sheer force and valor, began to free those
  who were being tormented, split apart, and shattered by their own evil deeds.
'23': >-
  Freed by Daśagrīva, the rākṣasa, those beings attained happiness for a
  moment—unexpected and unimagined.
'24': >-
  When the dead were being released by that great rākṣasa, the guardians of the
  departed, exceedingly enraged, rushed upon the lord of rākṣasas.
'25': >-
  Then from every quarter there arose a tumultuous “hala-hala!”—the cry of
  Dharma-rāja’s warriors as those heroes came running together.
'26': >-
  In hundreds of thousands, those heroes showered Puṣpaka with spears, iron
  bars, tridents, clubs, darts, and javelins.
'27': >-
  They swiftly shattered the seats, terraces, platforms, and gateways of
  Puṣpaka, like a swarm of bees breaking a honeycomb.
'28': >-
  In that battle, that aerial car Puṣpaka—once the conveyance of the
  Devas—though being battered, still remained imperishable by the brahma-tejas
  that guarded it.
'29': >-
  Numberless and exceedingly great was the army of that high-souled
  one—thousands and hundreds of thousands of foremost heroes.
'30': >-
  Then with trees and with rocks, and likewise with hundreds of palace-towers;
  then his counselors also, according to their desire and according to their
  strength, fought—those great warriors—and so too did the king Daśānana
  himself.
'31': >-
  Smeared with blood, struck by every kind of weapon, the ministers of the lord
  of rākṣasas made that battle dreadful and vast.
'32': >-
  Those fortunate warriors smote one another fiercely with weapons—the ministers
  of Rāvaṇa and the warriors of Yama, O mighty-armed.
'33': >-
  But leaving aside those ministers, Yama’s mighty warriors rushed straight at
  Daśānana himself, raining down volleys of tridents.
'34': >-
  Then the lord of rākṣasas, his limbs smeared with blood and mangled by blows,
  shone in Puṣpaka like an aśoka tree in full bloom.
'35': >-
  Then that powerful one, relying on the strength of his weapons, hurled forth
  tridents, maces, nooses, darts, javelins, arrows, clubs, as well as boulders
  and trees.
'36': >-
  That exceedingly dreadful hail of trees, rocks, and weapons fell upon Yama’s
  army and upon the surface of the earth.
'37': >-
  But piercing through them all and striking down that volley of weapons, those
  warriors by hundreds of thousands slew a single terrible rākṣasa.
'38': >-
  Surrounding him on every side like men casting down a mountain with useless
  loads, they battered him with bhindipālas and tridents until he was left
  without breath.
'39': >-
  His armor cast off, enraged, drenched with streams of blood, he then abandoned
  Puṣpaka and took his stand upon the earth.
'40': >-
  Then, bow in hand, he advanced into the battle; regaining full awareness in a
  moment, he stood wrathful like Antaka (Death) himself.
'41': >-
  Then, fixing upon his bow the divine Pāśupata weapon, he cried to them,
  “Stand! Stand!” and drew that bow.
'42': >-
  Drawing the bow to the ear in that combat, the foe of Indra, in wrath,
  released that arrow—like Śaṅkara hurling his shaft at Tripura.
'43': >-
  The form of that arrow was like a circle of smokeless flame, like a surging
  forest-fire in the heat of summer, about to burn up a wood.
'44': >-
  Wreathed in flames, that arrow—followed by flesh-eating spirits—sped through
  the battle, and, having reduced thickets and even trees to ashes, rushed
  onward.
'45': >-
  Burnt by its blazing energy, the armies of Vaivasvata (Yama) fell in that
  battle like mountains consumed by a conflagration.
'46': >-
  Then the rākṣasa of terrible valor, together with his counselors, roared a
  mighty roar, as though shaking the very earth.
'47': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-first canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Battle between Yama and
  Rāvaṇa.”
