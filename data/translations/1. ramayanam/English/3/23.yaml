  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-third chapter, named “The Appearing of Portents (Ut-pāta-darśanam).”
'1': >-
  Upon that dread army as it set forth, there rained a most terrible, tumultuous
  shower—inauspicious, with water the color of blood, and of a dark, donkey-hued
  appearance.
'2': >-
  Then, by sheer chance, the horses yoked to his chariot—very swift—fell down on
  the level royal road, in a place strewn with flowers.
'3': >-
  A dark halo, reaching to the hue of blood, formed, as it were taking hold of
  the Sun; it appeared like a revolving wheel of firebrand.
'4': >-
  Then, coming up to the lofty banner-staff with its golden pole, a huge-bodied
  and exceedingly dreadful vulture alighted upon it and stood there.
'5': >-
  And near Janasthāna, flesh-eating beasts and birds, harsh-voiced, cried out
  various discordant sounds.
'6': >-
  In the blazing quarter of the sky they uttered a fearsome cry; and terrible
  she-jackals, with mighty voices, howled—an evil omen for the rākṣasas.
'7': >-
  Clouds, resembling maddened elephants and streaming water like blood, made the
  sky seem as though it were no sky at all—terrifying clouds of rain.
'8': >-
  A dreadful, overpowering darkness arose, causing the hair to stand on end;
  neither the directions nor the intermediate quarters shone forth clearly.
'9': >-
  Without the proper time, a twilight appeared, red and wet-looking like fresh
  blood; and then fierce beasts and birds cried out facing toward Khara.
'10': >-
  Herons, jackals, and vultures screamed, foretelling fear; and terrible
  she-jackals—ever working ill in battle—showed dreadful omens.
'11': >-
  Facing that army, there appeared a Kabandha—like a great iron bar in
  shape—near the Sun, with a mouth that seemed to belch flames; and they howled
  towards the host.
'12': >-
  On a day that was not the new-moon, the great graha named Svarbhānu seized the
  Sun; a wind blew swiftly, and the Sun became lusterless.
'13': >-
  And, though it was not night, stars rose up, shining like fireflies;
  lotus-pools became devoid of fish and birds, and the lotuses withered and
  dried.
'14': >-
  At that very moment, trees stood without blossoms and fruits; and dust,
  reddish like rain-clouds, was violently whirled up even without any wind.
'15': >-
  There, mynas cried out with “cīcīkūcī”; and meteors too, accompanied by loud
  noise and dreadful to behold, fell down.
'16': >-
  The earth itself shook—together with its mountains, forests, and groves—while
  Khara, standing in his chariot, was roaring, strong of understanding.
'17': >-
  His left arm trembled, his voice faltered and stuck; his sight became tearful
  as he looked about on every side.
'18': >-
  Pain arose in his forehead, yet, through delusion, he did not turn back.
  Having observed those great portents, arisen and causing the hair to bristle,
'19': >-
  Khara then, laughing, spoke to all the rākṣasas about all those great portents
  that had arisen, terrible to behold:
'20': >-
  “I, through my might, do not heed them—like a powerful man disregarding the
  weak. With my sharp arrows I could even make the stars fall from the sky!
'21': >-
  Enraged, I shall yoke even Death to death’s own law. That Rāghava, intoxicated
  with strength, and his brother Lakṣmaṇa as well—
'22': >-
  Unless I slay them with keen shafts, I do not have the heart to turn
  back—those by reason of whom calamity is coming upon Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.
'23': >-
  Let my sister have her desire fulfilled, after drinking the blood of those
  two. Never before have I met defeat in battles.
'24': >-
  This is before your very eyes; I speak no falsehood. Even the king of the
  gods—Indra himself—when I am wrathful, riding upon the intoxicated Airāvata,
'25': >-
  I would strike down in war—what then of those two mere men? Hearing his roar,
  that great host of rākṣasas, freed from the noose of death (as it seemed),
'26': >-
  obtained unequalled exhilaration; and great-souled ones too, desiring to
  witness the battle, gathered together.
'27': >-
  Ṛṣis, devas, gandharvas, and siddhas together with cāraṇas assembled; and,
  united, those doers of holy deeds spoke to one another:
'28': >-
  “Let there be well-being for cows and brāhmaṇas, and for the worlds that are
  held in esteem. Let Rāghava be victorious in battle over the Paulastyas, the
  night-roaming rākṣasas.
'29': >-
  As Viṣṇu with discus in hand (prevails) over all the foremost among asuras—”
  Thus and many other such words, again and again, the great ṛṣis spoke.
'30': >-
  There, the gods as well, stationed in their aerial cars, filled with eager
  curiosity, beheld the rākṣasas’ host, whose lifespan was (as though) already
  spent.
'31': >-
  But Khara, with speed, drove forth in his chariot ahead of the army—swift as a
  hawk in flight, broad-necked, the enemy of sacrifice, bird-like in swiftness.
'32': >-
  There were (his champions): Durjaya; Karavīrākṣa; the harsh Kālakārmuka;
  Hemamālī; Mahāmālī; Sarpāsya; and Rudhirāśana.
'33': >-
  These twelve, of great valor, set out surrounding Khara. And Mahākapāla,
  Sthūlākṣa, Pramātha, and likewise Triśiras—these four marched in the forefront
  of the army, while Dūṣaṇa followed at the rear.
'34': >-
  That rākṣasa army—of dreadful speed, eager for battle, and exceedingly
  fierce—rushed at those two princes with sudden onslaught, like a garland of
  planets (grahas) surging upon the Moon and the Sun.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-third chapter of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic, named “The Appearing of Portents
  (Ut-pāta-darśanam).”
