  Now begins the Fifty-ninth Sarga (chapter), named “Exhortation to the Task
  that Follows,” in the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Having thus related everything, Hanumān, the son of Māruta (the Wind-god),
  once more set about speaking further—uttering words in continuation, as a
  fitting reply.
'2': >-
  Successful indeed is the endeavour of Rāghava, and successful the zealous
  exertion of Sugrīva; for, having beheld the noble character of Sītā, my own
  heart too has been greatly gladdened.
'3': >-
  O foremost of monkeys, the conduct of Sītā is wholly befitting of a noble
  lady: by the power of her austerity she could uphold the worlds; and if
  angered, she could even burn them down.
'4': >-
  In every way surpassingly mighty is that Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas—since,
  though he touched her body, he was not destroyed by the power of her
  austerity.
'5': >-
  That chaste lady’s hand, upon touching, would not act like a flame of fire;
  for the daughter of Janaka could do what she would, once her wrath became
  sullied and roused.
'6': >-
  Having taken leave of all the great monkeys, with Jāmbavān at their head, (I
  say:) since I have come thus far in this enterprise and have also reported the
  matter to you, it is only proper now that those two sons of the king should
  see Vaidehī (Sītā).
'7': >-
  I alone am sufficient to rush upon and destroy that Laṅkā, that city filled
  with hosts of rākṣasas, and to slay mighty Rāvaṇa as well.
'8': >-
  How much more, then, if I were accompanied by you—heroic, strong,
  self-controlled monkeys, endowed with mastery of weapons, capable and seeking
  victory?
'9': >-
  I, for my part, shall in battle kill Rāvaṇa together with his army and his
  attendants in front of him; and I shall also slay him along with his son, and
  along with his brothers, upon the battlefield.
'10': >-
  Even if Indrajit should employ in combat those dread weapons—the Brahmā
  weapon, the Rudra weapon, the Vāyavya weapon, and likewise the Vāruṇa
  weapon—hard to behold and difficult to withstand, I shall destroy them, and I
  shall strike down and scatter the rākṣasas.
'11': >-
  Only your lack of permission restrains my prowess. For from me would be
  unleashed an unequalled and unceasing showering down of mountains.
'12': >-
  In war I could slay even the devas—how much more those night-rangers; but my
  valour, not having your consent, holds me back.
'13': >-
  The ocean itself might overstep its shore; Mandara might even be shaken from
  its place; yet no enemy host in battle could make Jāmbavān tremble.
'14': >-
  For the destruction of all the assemblages of rākṣasas, and even of those
  rākṣasas of former times, one alone is enough—Vāli’s heroic son, the monkey.
'15': >-
  By the mighty speed of the monkey Nīla, that great soul, even Mandara could be
  torn apart—how much more, then, the rākṣasas in battle?
'16': >-
  Among devas, asuras, and yakṣas; among gandharvas, nāgas, and birds—declare,
  if you can, one who could stand as a counter-warrior to Mainda or to Dvivida.
'17': >-
  Those two best of monkeys, the sons of the Aśvins, are of great swiftness; I
  do not see, upon the field of battle, anyone who could oppose either of them
  as an equal combatant.
'18': >-
  By me alone was Laṅkā struck down—its city burned and reduced to ashes; and in
  all the royal highways I caused my name to be proclaimed far and wide.
'19': >-
  Victory attends exceedingly mighty Rāma, and Lakṣmaṇa of great strength;
  victory attends King Sugrīva, protected and upheld by Rāghava.
'20': >-
  I am the servant of the king of Kosala, born of the Wind; as ‘Hanumān’ my name
  has been made known by me everywhere.
'21': >-
  In the midst of the Aśoka grove of the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, beneath the
  śiṃśapā tree, the virtuous lady sat in piteous misery.
'22': >-
  Surrounded by rākṣasīs, wasted by the torment of sorrow, she appeared
  lusterless—like the line of the moon obscured by streaks of cloud.
'23': >-
  Vaidehī, not giving thought to Rāvaṇa puffed up with the pride of strength,
  steadfast in wifely fidelity—fair-hipped Jānakī—remained unshaken.
'24': >-
  For auspicious Vaidehī is wholly devoted to Rāma with her entire being; her
  mind is fixed on none but Rāma—like Paulomī (Śacī) on Purandara (Indra).
'25': >-
  Clad in but a single garment, covered with dust as well, she was repeatedly
  threatened again and again by the rākṣasīs, as I beheld her among them.
'26': >-
  Seen indeed in the grove of women among misshapen rākṣasīs, she was wretched,
  her hair gathered into a single braid, wholly intent on thoughts of her
  husband.
'27': >-
  Lying upon the bare ground, her limbs pale—like a lotus-plant at the rise of
  winter—she had ceased to seek anything from Rāvaṇa and had resolved upon
  death.
'28': >-
  Somehow, the doe-eyed lady was brought to trust; then she was spoken with, and
  every matter was disclosed and made clear.
'29': >-
  Hearing of the friendship between Rāma and Sugrīva, she attained joy; and her
  disciplined good conduct remained firm, and her devotion to her husband was
  supremely excellent.
'30': >-
  That great-souled one who will slay Daśagrīva is Daśānana himself (by his own
  deeds); Rāma, in that killing, will be but the instrumental cause.
'31': >-
  She is slender-limbed by nature, and by that separation she has been
  emaciated; like knowledge (vidyā) in one devoted to learning and recitation,
  she has become exceedingly thin.
'32': >-
  Thus does the illustrious Sītā remain, wholly given over to grief. Therefore,
  let everything that is to be done in this matter be fully prepared.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the Fifty-ninth Sarga, named “Exhortation to the Task that Follows,”
  in the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
