  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, begins the seventy-first
  sarga, named “The Promise of the Bestowal of the Maidens (in Marriage).”
'1': >-
  When he had spoken thus, Janaka, with joined palms, replied: “It is fitting
  that you should hear—may auspiciousness be yours—the lineage of our house as
  it is recounted.”
'2': >-
  “For indeed, O best of sages, at the time of giving a maiden in marriage, one
  who is born in a noble line must declare the lineage fully and without
  omission. Therefore, O great-minded one, understand it well.”
'3': >-
  “There was a king famed in the three worlds by his own deeds—Nimi, supremely
  righteous, the foremost among all beings possessed of goodness.”
'4': >-
  “His son was named Mithi; and Janaka was the son of Mithi. That first king was
  called Janaka; and from that Janaka was born Udāvasu.”
'5': >-
  “From Udāvasu was born the righteous Nandivardhana; and from Nandivardhana’s
  son, the valiant hero named Suketu.”
'6': >-
  “From Suketu also was born the righteous and mighty Devarāta; and of Devarāta,
  that royal sage, was born one remembered as Bṛhadratha.”
'7': >-
  “To Bṛhadratha was born the heroic, great warrior, mighty in prowess—Mahāvīra;
  and to Mahāvīra was born the steadfast Sudhṛti, whose valour was true.”
'8': >-
  “From Sudhṛti also was born Dhṛṣṭaketu, righteous in spirit and a practiser of
  good dharma; and of Dhṛṣṭaketu, that royal sage, was born one renowned as
  Haryaśva.”
'9': >-
  “Haryaśva’s son was Maru; Maru’s son was Pratīndhaka; and Pratīndhaka’s son
  was the righteous king Kīrtiratha.”
'10': >-
  “Kīrtiratha’s son also is remembered as Devamīḍha; Devamīḍha’s son was
  Vibudha; and Vibudha’s son was Mahīdhraka.”
'11': >-
  “Mahīdhraka’s son was the mighty king Kīrtirāta; and to Kīrtirāta, that royal
  sage, Mahāromā was born.”
'12': >-
  “From Mahāromā, the righteous, was born Svarṇaromā; and from Svarṇaromā, that
  royal sage, Hrasvaromā was born.”
'13': >-
  “To that king—knower of dharma, great-souled—were born two sons. I am the
  elder; my younger brother is the valiant Kuśadhvaja.”
'14': >-
  “My father, having anointed me, the eldest, to the kingdom, entrusted
  Kuśadhvaja to my care and, laying the burden upon me, departed to the forest.”
'15': >-
  “When my aged father had gone to heaven, I bore the yoke of duty in
  righteousness, all the while looking with affection upon my brother
  Kuśadhvaja, who was radiant like a god.”
'16': >-
  “After some time had passed, the powerful king Sudhanvā came from his city of
  Sāṅkāśya, intent upon besieging Mithilā.”
'17': >-
  “And he sent to me an unsurpassed bow of Śiva, and this message: ‘Let Sītā,
  that lotus-eyed maiden, be given to me.’”
'18': >-
  “Because I would not give her, O great seer, war arose between him and me; and
  that king Sudhanvā was slain by me, facing me in battle.”
'19': >-
  “Having slain that lord of men, Sudhanvā, O best of sages, I anointed my
  heroic brother Kuśadhvaja in Sāṅkāśya.”
'20': >-
  “This my brother is the younger, O great sage, and I the elder. Most gladly, O
  foremost of sages, I bestow upon you two brides.”
'21': >-
  “Sītā to Rāma—may auspiciousness be yours—and Ūrmilā indeed to Lakṣmaṇa. Sītā,
  my daughter, whose bride-price is valour, resembling the daughter of the gods,
  I give to Rāma.”
'22': >-
  “And the second, Ūrmilā also—thrice I declare it, with no doubt—I give, most
  gladly, as brides, O foremost of sages.”
'23': >-
  “O King, have the gift of cows performed for Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa; and—may
  auspiciousness be yours—perform also the rites due to the forefathers;
  thereafter carry out the marriage-ceremonies.”
'24': >-
  “For today the asterism is Maghā, O mighty-armed one; on the third day, O
  lord, when the Uttara Phālgunī (asterism) arises, O King, perform the marriage
  on that day. For the sake of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, let the giving (of gifts) be
  done, bringing about happiness and prosperity.”
'25': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-first sarga, named “The Promise of the Bestowal of the
  Maidens,” in the Bāla-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
