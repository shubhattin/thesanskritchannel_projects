  Now begins, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Sundara-kanda, the
  thirty-third canto, named “The commencement of the dialogue between Hanuman
  and Janaki (Sita).”
'1': >-
  Then, descending from that tree, Hanuman—whose face was like coral—approached
  in a humble and modest guise; wretched in appearance, he bowed low, prostrated
  himself, and drew near.
'2': >-
  That mighty, radiant Hanuman, the son of the Wind-god, addressed Sita: placing
  his palms together in reverence upon his head, he spoke to her in sweet and
  gentle words.
'3': >-
  “Who indeed are you, O lotus-leaf–eyed lady, clad in worn and soiled silken
  raiment? O blameless one, why do you stand, clinging to the branch of this
  tree?”
'4': >-
  “For what reason does water, born of grief, stream from your eyes—like water
  scattered from two lotus petals?”
'5': >-
  “Of the Suras and the Asuras, of Nagas, Gandharvas, and Rakshasas, of Yakshas
  and Kinnaras—who are you, O lovely one?”
'6': >-
  “Who are you among the Rudras or the Maruts, O fair-faced lady? Or among the
  Vasus, O woman of excellent limbs? You appear to me like a goddess.”
'7': >-
  “Are you Rohini, the foremost among the luminaries, the best, endowed with
  every superior quality—fallen from the abode of the gods, and now separated
  from the moon?”
'8': >-
  “Or, O dark-eyed auspicious one, have you—through anger or through
  delusion—offended your lord, and so, having angered Vasishta, do you dwell
  here as Arundhati?”
'9': >-
  “Or who—son, father, brother, or husband—of yours, O slender-waisted lady, has
  gone from this world to the next, whom you thus lament?”
'10': >-
  “Yet, from your weeping, from your heavy sighing, and also from your touching
  the earth (in sorrow), I do not think you are a goddess—judging by the
  certainty of your human condition.”
'11': >-
  “Indeed, the signs and distinctive marks that are in you I observe: I deem you
  to be a queen of some king, and also the daughter of a ruler.”
'12': >-
  “If you have been forcibly violated and carried away by Ravana from
  Janasthana—if you are Sita—blessings be upon you; tell me this, for I ask
  you.”
'13': >-
  “For truly, as your misery is, and as your beauty too is beyond human measure,
  and as your attire bears the stamp of austerity—surely you are Rama’s chief
  queen.”
'14': >-
  Hearing his words, and rejoicing at the very mention of Rama, Vaidehi (Sita),
  resting upon the tree, spoke these words to Hanuman.
'15': >-
  “I am the daughter-in-law of Dasharatha—the foremost of royal lions upon
  earth—of that high-souled king who is known to be steadfast in self-knowledge,
  and who destroys the armies of his foes.”
'16': >-
  “I am the daughter of Janaka, the great-souled king of Videha. I am called by
  the name ‘Sita,’ and I am the wife of the wise Rama.”
'17': >-
  “For twelve years there I dwelt in the home of Raghava, enjoying human
  pleasures, fulfilled in every desire, abounding in all that is wished for.”
'18': >-
  “Then, in the thirteenth year, when the Ikshvaku prince was to be consecrated
  to the kingship, the king, together with his family priest, set about the
  preparations for the anointing.”
'19': >-
  “While the consecration of Raghava was being arranged, Kaikeyi by name spoke
  these words to her husband.”
'20': >-
  “‘I will neither drink nor eat my daily food. This will be the end of my life
  if Rama is consecrated.’”
'21': >-
  “‘That word which you once spoke to me in gladness, O best of kings—if that is
  not to be made false, let Raghava go to the forest.’”
'22': >-
  That king, truthful of speech, remembering the boon granted to the queen,
  became bewildered on hearing Kaikeyi’s cruel and unwelcome words.
'23': >-
  Then the aged king, established in the dharma of truth, weeping, begged his
  eldest son—glorious and renowned—to accept the kingdom.
'24': >-
  The illustrious Rama, holding his father’s command dearer even than
  consecration, first embraced it in his mind, and then accepted it in speech.
'25': >-
  He would give and not take; he would speak truth and not falsehood—Rama, whose
  valor is founded upon truth, even for the sake of life itself.
'26': >-
  That great and glorious one, casting aside his costly upper garments,
  renouncing the kingdom in his heart, instructed his mother and also commanded
  me (to accompany him).
'27': >-
  “And I, following close before him, swiftly set out to live as one who dwells
  in the forest; for, bereft of him, dwelling even in heaven would not please
  me.”
'28': >-
  “But even earlier, the fortunate Saumitri (Lakshmana), the delight of his
  friends, wishing to follow his elder brother, was adorned in garments of
  kusa-grass and bark-cloth.”
'29': >-
  “Thus we, firm in our vows, honoring our lord’s command, entered the
  forest—never before seen by us—terrible in its deep and solemn aspect.”
'30': >-
  “While I was dwelling in the Dandaka forest with that Rama of immeasurable
  might, I—his wife—was carried off by a Rakshasa: by the wicked-souled Ravana.”
'31': >-
  “For two months he has granted me time as a favor to my life; but after two
  more months have passed, then I shall abandon my life.”
'32': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-third canto of the Sundara-kanda in the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the primordial epic, entitled “The commencement of the dialogue
  between Hanuman and Janaki (Sita).”
