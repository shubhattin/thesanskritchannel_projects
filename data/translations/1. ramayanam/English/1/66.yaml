  Now, in the blessed Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Bala-kanda, the sixty-sixth
  chapter, named “The Episode Concerning the Bow.”
'1': >-
  Then, when the morning was clear and immaculate, the lord of men (King
  Janaka), having performed his prescribed rites and duties, summoned the
  great-souled Visvamitra, along with Raghava (Rama).
'2': >-
  That righteous king, having honored him with the rites enjoined by the
  scriptures, then addressed those two great-souled Raghavas (Rama and
  Lakshmana) with words.
'3': >-
  “O Bhagavan, welcome be unto you, O sinless one. What shall I do for you?
  Command me—indeed I am to be commanded by you.”
'4': >-
  Thus addressed by the great-souled, righteous Janaka, the foremost of sages,
  skilled in speech, replied with apt words.
'5': >-
  “These two sons of Dasaratha, kshatriyas renowned throughout the world, desire
  to see the excellent, foremost bow that is in your keeping.”
'6': >-
  “Show it, blessings upon you. The princes will have their desire fulfilled;
  and upon seeing that bow, they will return according to their wish.”
'7': >-
  Thus spoken to, Janaka replied to the great sage: “Let it be heard for what
  reason this bow is kept here.”
'8': >-
  “A king named Devarata, the eldest son of Nimi and a ruler of the earth—this
  (bow) is a trust, O Bhagavan, placed in his hands by that great-souled one.”
'9': >-
  “Formerly, at the destruction of Daksha’s sacrifice, the mighty one,
  stretching his bow, and from wrath ready to destroy the gods, spoke these
  words, as it were, with tears.”
'10': >-
  ‘Since the gods did not apportion to me my due share, though I sought my
  portion, I shall with my bow sever your most excellent, highly precious
  limbs!’
'11': >-
  “Then all the gods, downcast in mind, O bull among sages, sought to propitiate
  the Lord of the gods; and Bhava (Siva) became pleased with them.”
'12': >-
  “Being gratified toward them all, he bestowed it upon those great-souled ones:
  this is that bow-jewel of the great-souled God of gods.”
'13': >-
  “As a deposited trust it was then placed with our forefather, the mighty one.
  And thereafter, while I was ploughing my field, it arose from the furrow of
  the plough.”
'14': >-
  “While I was cleansing the field, I found her, famed by the name ‘Sita’; she
  sprang up from the surface of the earth, and she grew up as my daughter.”
'15': >-
  “This my daughter, not born from a womb, has been established by me as ‘to be
  won for a bride-price of valor.’ That one who arose from the earth—my
  daughter—growing up (thus)…,”
'16': >-
  “…kings came and sought her hand, O bull among sages. While all those rulers
  of the earth were seeking the maiden,”
'17': >-
  “I did not give my daughter, O Bhagavan, (saying): ‘She is to be won for a
  bride-price of valor.’ Thereupon all the kings, assembling, O bull among
  sages,”
'18': >-
  “came to Mithila, desiring then to test their prowess; and for those who were
  seeking to ascertain (their strength), the bow of Siva was brought forth.”
'19': >-
  “They were not able to grasp it—nor even to lift that bow. Having understood
  the smallness of the valor of those who fancied themselves valorous, O great
  sage,”
'20': >-
  “those kings were rejected—know this, O ascetic rich in austerities. Then, in
  extreme anger, O bull among sages,”
'21': >-
  “all those kings, having fallen into doubt about (their own) prowess,
  obstructed and besieged Mithila; and the foremost of kings, knowing that I had
  been insulted,”
'22': >-
  “were seized with great wrath and afflicted the city of Mithila. When a full
  year was completed, all my means and resources were exhausted in every way, O
  best of sages.”
'23': >-
  “Then, being exceedingly distressed, I propitiated all the hosts of gods by
  austerity.”
'24': >-
  “The gods, exceedingly pleased, granted me a fourfold army; then those kings
  were defeated, and when they were being slain, they fled to the quarters.”
'25': >-
  “Devoid of true valor, doubting (their own) prowess, together with their
  ministers—evil-doers—(they fled). This, O tiger among sages, is that supremely
  radiant bow.”
'26': >-
  “And I shall show it also to Rama and Lakshmana, O you of excellent vow. If
  Rama should string that bow, O sage, then I shall give to Dasarathi my
  womb-unborn daughter Sita.”
'27': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-sixth chapter, named “The Episode Concerning the Bow,” in
  the Bala-kanda of the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, the Adi-kavya.
