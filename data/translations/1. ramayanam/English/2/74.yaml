  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyākāṇḍa,
  begins the seventy-fourth chapter, named “Bharata’s denunciation of Kaikeyī.”
'1': >-
  Having thus reproached his mother, Bharata, possessed by exceedingly great
  wrath, once again spoke these words:
'2': >-
  “Fall away from the kingdom, Kaikeyī—cruel one, of wicked conduct! Abandoned
  in accordance with dharma, do not become one who weeps beside the dead.”
'3': >-
  “What indeed did the king do to offend you? Or what did Rāma—so exceedingly
  righteous—do, that because of you death came upon the one, and exile upon the
  other, as though equal?”
'4': >-
  “By bringing about the destruction of this lineage, you have incurred the sin
  of slaying an embryo. Kaikeyī, go to hell; do not attain the same world as
  your husband.”
'5': >-
  “For by you this evil has been done through a dreadful deed—abandoning one
  beloved of all the worlds, and even bringing fear upon me.”
'6': >-
  “Because of you my father has met his end, and Rāma has taken refuge in the
  forest; and through you I have been made infamous in the world while yet
  alive.”
'7': >-
  “O enemy to me in the guise of a mother—cruel woman, greedy for sovereignty— I
  am not to be spoken to by you, of evil conduct, slayer of your husband!”
'8': >-
  “Kauśalyā and Sumitrā, and the other mothers of mine as well—overwhelmed by
  great sorrow—have come to grief because of you, O defiler of the family.”
'9': >-
  “You are not the daughter of Aśvapati, the wise lord of Dharma; you are a
  rākṣasī, born there for the ruin of your father’s line.”
'10': >-
  “Because you sent righteous Rāma—ever devoted to truth—into the forest, my
  father too departed to the heavens in grief.”
'11': >-
  “Since you are the chief cause of this sin—done without me, without my father,
  with my brothers abandoned, and hateful to all the world—”
'12': >-
  “Having separated Kauśalyā, united with dharma, from her son—O one resolved on
  sin—what world will you attain today, you who are bound for hell?”
'13': >-
  “Do you not understand, O cruel one, the sure refuge of kinsmen—Rāma, the
  eldest, equal to a father, born of Kauśalyā herself?”
'14': >-
  “A son is born from a mother’s limbs and sub-limbs, and even from her very
  heart; therefore, because of that intimacy, he is dearer to the mother than
  other relatives.”
'15': >-
  “Once, it is said, Surabhi—knowing dharma, honored among the gods—saw on the
  earth her two sons, their senses gone, bearing a burden.”
'16': >-
  “Seeing her two sons, weary at midday, upon the ground, she wept in grief for
  her sons, her eyes troubled with tears.”
'17': >-
  “As she went below (from the heavens), from that great-souled lord of the
  gods, there fell upon his body tiny drops, fragrant with the scent of
  Surabhi.”
'18': >-
  “Even Indra, the lord of the gods, noticing that fall of tears upon his own
  body—of holy fragrance—recognized (their source) upon seeing Surabhi and
  understood that she was in great distress.”
'19': >-
  “Looking about, Śakra saw Surabhi standing there in the sky, wretched,
  weeping, and utterly afflicted by sorrow.”
'20': >-
  “Seeing her scorched by grief, the wielder of the thunderbolt—glorious Indra,
  king of the gods—anxiously addressed her with joined palms, saying:”
'21': >-
  “‘Is there, perhaps, no great fear arising from anywhere among us? From what
  cause is your grief? Tell me, O seeker of the welfare of all.’”
'22': >-
  “Thus spoken to by the wise king of the gods, Surabhi—steadfast and skilled in
  speech—then replied to her lord:”
'23': >-
  “‘There is no calamity for you from anywhere, O lord of the immortals. But I
  grieve for my own two sons, sunk in a dire plight.’”
'24': >-
  “‘Seeing these two, lean and wretched, scorched by the heat of the sun’s rays,
  being driven on—strong though they are—by a ploughman, O lord of the gods—’”
'25': >-
  “‘Both born of my body, afflicted and oppressed by the burden—seeing whom I am
  tormented; for none is dear like one’s own son.’”
'26': >-
  “When Śakra saw her—she whose thousand sons pervade this entire world—yet
  weeping, he understood that nothing is dearer than one’s sons.”
'27': >-
  “Ever of incomparable conduct, desiring to uphold the worlds; possessed of
  fortune, ever endowed with virtues; acting in accordance with her own nature—”
'28': >-
  “Even she, Kāmadhenu, though she has thousands of sons, grieves. What then of
  Kauśalyā—how will she live without Rāma?”
'29': >-
  “Chaste and virtuous, with but one son—today you have made her as one without
  a calf; therefore you shall obtain unceasing sorrow, here and after death as
  well.”
'30': >-
  “But I shall, without doubt, accomplish complete requital to my brother and
  father— and I shall also augment their glory.”
'31': >-
  “Having brought back that son of Kauśalyā, of great splendor, I myself shall
  enter the forest, resorted to by sages.”
'32': >-
  “For I, of sinless intent, cannot endure this sin—done by you, of sinful
  mind—while being looked upon by the citizens, their throats choked with
  tears.”
'33': >-
  “Therefore you—either enter the fire, or yourself go into Daṇḍaka; or bind a
  rope about your neck: for there is no other refuge for you.”
'34': >-
  “When Rāma, whose valor is grounded in truth, has returned and reached the
  earth (Ayodhyā), I too shall become one whose purpose is fulfilled, my stain
  of exile washed away.”
'35': >-
  Speaking thus, Bharata—like an elephant in the wilderness prodded by spear and
  goad—fell to the ground in fury, hissing like a serpent.
'36': >-
  His eyes bloodshot, his garment loosened, all his ornaments shaken
  off—Bharata, the prince, scorcher of foes, lay fallen upon the earth like the
  banner of Śacī’s lord (Indra) when a festival comes to its end.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-fourth chapter in the Ayodhyākāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, called “Bharata’s denunciation of Kaikeyī.”
