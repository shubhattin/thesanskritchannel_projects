  Now, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-first chapter, entitled “The Account of Kumbhakarṇa’s Deeds.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon Rāma, of great splendour and mighty prowess, taking up his bow,
  beheld Kumbhakarṇa—crowned, of विशाल (vast) body and formidable frame.
'2': >-
  Seeing that foremost of rākṣasas, whose appearance was like a mountain,
  advancing as though he were treading the very sky—like Nārāyaṇa of old—Rāma
  marked him well.
'3': >-
  Beholding him, dark as a rain-laden cloud and adorned with golden armlets and
  ornaments, the mighty host of vānaras once again fled in terror.
'4': >-
  Seeing the army in rout, and the rākṣasa growing ever nearer, Rāma, filled
  with astonishment, spoke these words to Vibhīṣaṇa.
'5': >-
  “Who is this hero, mountain-like, wearing a crown, with tawny eyes, seen in
  Laṅkā—like a thunder-bearing cloud with lightning?”
'6': >-
  “He seems a great and singular banner upon the earth. On seeing him, all the
  vānaras are running away in every direction.”
'7': >-
  “Tell me truly—who is this exceedingly mighty being? Is he a rākṣasa, or an
  asura? Never before have I beheld a creature of such a kind.”
'8': >-
  Thus questioned by the prince Rāma, unwearied in action, Vibhīṣaṇa, of great
  wisdom, replied to the scion of Kakutstha.
'9': >-
  “He by whom, in battle, Vaivasvata (Yama) and Vāsava (Indra) were
  vanquished—he is Kumbhakarṇa, the valorous son of Viśravas. Another rākṣasa
  equal to him in stature and measure does not exist.”
'10': >-
  “By him, O Rāghava, in battle, thousands upon thousands of devas and dānavas,
  yakṣas and serpents, flesh-eating beings, gandharvas, vidyādharas, and
  kiṁnaras have been utterly crushed.”
'11': >-
  “The Tridaśas (gods) were not able to slay Kumbhakarṇa—mighty-armed with a
  trident, of distorted-eyed visage, and of immense strength—for they were
  deluded, thinking, ‘This is the appointed time (of destiny).’”
'12': >-
  “By nature indeed this Kumbhakarṇa is radiant and of great might; whereas the
  strength of other lords of rākṣasas is the result of boons bestowed.”
'13': >-
  “Even as a mere child, newly born, that great-souled one, tormented by hunger,
  devoured thousands—indeed very many—of living beings.”
'14': >-
  “While they were being eaten, the people, crushed by fear, went for refuge to
  Śakra (Indra) and reported that matter to him.”
'15': >-
  “Then the great Indra, enraged, the wielder of the thunderbolt, struck
  Kumbhakarṇa with the sharp vajra. Struck by Śakra’s thunderbolt, that
  great-souled one staggered—and in wrath roared exceedingly loud.”
'16': >-
  “Hearing the roar of that rākṣasa Kumbhakarṇa as he bellowed, the people,
  already frightened, were again seized by still greater terror.”
'17': >-
  “Then Kumbhakarṇa, of immense strength, furious at great Indra, tore out a
  tusk from Airāvata and struck Vāsava upon the chest.”
'18': >-
  “Sorely afflicted by Kumbhakarṇa’s blow, that Vāsava blazed up in fury; and
  then, all at once, devas, brahmarṣis, and dānavas were cast into dejection.”
'19': >-
  “Then Śakra, together with the people, went to the abode of Svayambhū
  (Brahmā). To Prajāpati they recounted Kumbhakarṇa’s wickedness.”
'20': >-
  “The devouring of the people, the assault upon the gods, the destruction of
  hermitages, and the violent abduction of other men’s wives—these they
  declared.”
'21': >-
  “‘If he keeps devouring the people continually in this manner, then in a very
  short time the world will become empty.’”
'22': >-
  “Hearing the words of Vāsava, the Grandsire of all worlds summoned the
  rākṣasas and beheld Kumbhakarṇa.”
'23': >-
  “On merely looking at Kumbhakarṇa, Prajāpati was struck with dread. Then
  Svayambhū, having composed himself, spoke these words to Kumbhakarṇa.”
'24': >-
  “‘Surely you have been fashioned by the son of Pulastya (i.e., by your
  lineage) for the destruction of the worlds. Therefore, from this day onward,
  you shall sleep as though dead.’”
'25': >-
  “Then, overpowered by Brahmā’s curse, he fell down before the Lord. Thereupon
  Rāvaṇa, exceedingly agitated, spoke these words.”
'26': >-
  “‘A flourishing golden tree is cut down at the time of fruiting. It is not
  proper, O Prajāpati, thus to curse one’s own grandson.’”
'27': >-
  “‘You are not one whose speech proves false; therefore he shall indeed
  sleep—of this there is no doubt. Yet let a measure be fixed for him—both for
  sleeping and for waking.’”
'28': >-
  “Hearing Rāvaṇa’s words, Svayambhū replied: ‘He shall sleep for six months and
  shall awaken for one day.’”
'29': >-
  “‘In that single day, that hero, roaming upon the earth, ravenous with hunger,
  with mouth wide open, will devour the worlds—like a fire grown in strength.’”
'30': >-
  “Thus now fallen into calamity, Rāvaṇa has awakened Kumbhakarṇa—and, terrified
  of your prowess, the king at present is in fear.”
'31': >-
  “That hero of dreadful valour has come out from the camp; fiercely enraged, he
  runs about, devouring the vānaras.”
'32': >-
  “Seeing Kumbhakarṇa, the monkeys have fled today. How indeed will the vānaras
  be able to check him in battle when he is wrathful?”
'33': >-
  “Let all the vānaras be told that this is a contrivance (a stratagem) that has
  been set in motion; knowing this, the monkeys here will become fearless.”
'34': >-
  Hearing Vibhīṣaṇa’s well-reasoned words, spoken with fair countenance, Rāghava
  then addressed Nīla, the commander of the army.
'35': >-
  “Go—array all the forces and take your stand at the gateway. Seize the gates
  of Laṅkā, and also the approaches, crossings, and passages by which he
  advances.”
'36': >-
  “Gather mountain-peaks, trees, and great rocks. Let all of you vānaras be
  armed—bearing mountains in your hands as weapons.”
'37': >-
  Thus commanded by Rāghava, Nīla, lord of the monkey-host, that foremost of
  apes, directed the vānaras properly in every respect.
'38': >-
  Then Gavākṣa, Śarabha, Hanumān, and likewise Aṅgada, taking mountain-peaks
  like mountains, advanced toward the gate.
'39': >-
  Having heard Rāma’s command, the heroic monkeys—victorious in battle—crushed
  the enemy host, striking them down with trees.
'40': >-
  Thereupon that fierce army of monkeys shone forth, with hands uplifted holding
  rocks and trees—like a vast and terrible mass of great storm-clouds gathered
  near a mountain.
'41': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-first chapter in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Account of Kumbhakarṇa’s Deeds.”
