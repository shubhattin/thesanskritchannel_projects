'0': >-
  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninety-seventh canto, named “Sītā’s entering into Rasātala (the
  nether-region).”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by Vālmīki, Rāghava replied. With palms joined in reverence, in
  the midst of the assembled people, he looked upon that lady of excellent
  complexion and spoke.
'2': >-
  “So indeed it is, O greatly blessed one, as you—knower of
  righteousness—declare. O Brahman, by your stainless words my conviction is
  firmly established.”
'3': >-
  “Formerly, in the very presence of the gods, conviction concerning Vaidehī had
  already been obtained; and there a solemn oath was also made. Yet, even after
  she had been taken into the household, the powerful censure of the world—on
  account of which Maithilī was indeed abandoned—arose.”
'4': >-
  “Therefore, O Brahman, though knowing Sītā to be sinless, I abandoned her out
  of fear of public opinion. Let that intent of mine be forgiven.”
'5': >-
  “And I recognize these two sons of mine—Kuśa and Lava—born as twins. Let my
  affection be for Maithilī, purified in the midst of the world.”
'6': >-
  Understanding Rāma’s purpose, the most excellent among the gods—Indra and the
  others, mighty in splendor—(came forward) at that oath of Sītā.
'7': With Pitāmaha (Brahmā) placed at their head, all of them assembled there.
'8': >-
  The Ādityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the two Aśvins with the hosts of Maruts,
  and also the Gandharvas and the Apsarases—all of them assembled.
'9': >-
  The Sādhyas, the Viśvedevas, and all the supreme seers; the Nāgas, Suparṇas,
  and Siddhas—all of them, their minds delighted, and stirred with awe at Sītā’s
  oath, assembled there.
'10': >-
  Seeing the gods and the seers, Rāghava spoke again: “My certainty, O best of
  men, rests upon the stainless words of the sages.”
'11': “Let my affection be for Vaidehī, purified in the midst of the world.”
'12': >-
  Then a blessed and holy wind, fragrant with divine and delightful scent, blew
  forth; and that best of gods gladdened the multitude on every side.
'13': >-
  All who had assembled gazed upon that wondrous and inconceivable occurrence—as
  men from all kingdoms might gaze in the ancient Kṛta age.
'14': >-
  Seeing all those gathered, Sītā—clad in bark-garments—spoke with palms joined;
  her eyes were cast downward and her face turned toward the earth.
'15': >-
  “If I, even in mind, do not think of any man other than Rāghava, then let the
  goddess Mādhavī (the Earth) be pleased to grant me an opening.”
'16': >-
  “If, by mind, by deed, and by speech, I duly honor Rāma, then let the goddess
  Mādhavī be pleased to grant me an opening.”
'17': >-
  “If I know this utterance of mine to be true—and know none higher than
  Rāma—then let the goddess Mādhavī be pleased to grant me an opening.”
'18': >-
  As Vaidehī thus swore, that marvel came to be manifest: from the surface of
  the earth there arose an unsurpassed divine throne.
'19': >-
  It was borne aloft upon the heads of Nāgas of immeasurable prowess—radiant,
  with divine form, and adorned with celestial jewels.
'20': >-
  Upon that throne, the देवी Dharaṇī (Earth-goddess) took Maithilī in her arms,
  welcomed her with words of greeting, and seated her upon the seat.
'21': >-
  Beholding her seated upon the throne and entering into Rasātala, an unceasing
  shower of divine flowers rained down upon Sītā.
'22': >-
  And at once there rose a mighty cry of approval from the gods: “Well done!
  Well done, O Sītā—such indeed is your conduct!”
'23': >-
  Thus did the devas, stationed in the sky, with minds filled with joy, utter
  many kinds of exclamations on seeing Sītā’s entering (into the earth).
'24': >-
  The sages as well, all of them who were in the sacrificial enclosure, and the
  kings—tigers among men—did not cease from astonishment.
'25': >-
  In the sky and on the earth, all beings, both immovable and moving; and in the
  nether-world, the great-bodied Dānavas and the serpent-lords of Pātāla—(all
  were stirred).
'26': >-
  Some cried out in gladness; some were wholly intent on meditation; some kept
  their gaze upon Rāma; and some, senseless, fixed upon Sītā.
'27': >-
  Having seen Sītā’s entering, such was their concourse: in that very moment the
  whole world seemed exceedingly and evenly bewildered, as though seized by a
  common swoon.
'28': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-seventh canto, named “Sītā’s entering into Rasātala,” in
  the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
