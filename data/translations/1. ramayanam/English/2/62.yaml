  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-second sarga, entitled “The Appeasement of Kausalyā.”
'1': >-
  Thus did the king, having been addressed with harsh words by Rāma’s mother,
  Kausalyā, who was angered and overwhelmed with grief—hearing her speech—sit in
  sorrow, afflicted in mind, and began to ponder.
'2': >-
  Having pondered so, that king, his senses distraught, fell into a swoon. Then,
  after a long time, that subduer of foes regained consciousness.
'3': >-
  Recovering his senses, he heaved a long, hot sigh; and seeing Kausalyā beside
  him, he again fell into anxious thought.
'4': >-
  As he reflected, his former evil deed came clearly to his mind—what he had
  once done in the past, out of ignorance, by striking through sound
  (śabda-vedhin), shooting at a noise.
'5': >-
  His mind was not at ease—oppressed by that sorrow, and also by sorrow for
  Rāma. The great king, scorched by both griefs, suffered intensely.
'6': >-
  Burning with those two griefs, the lord of the earth spoke to Kausalyā.
  Trembling, with joined palms, and with his face cast down, he sought her
  favour and forgiveness.
'7': >-
  “I implore you, Kausalyā; this gesture of folded hands has been made by me.
  You are ever affectionate and compassionate—even toward others.”
'8': >-
  “For women, indeed, the husband—whether endowed with virtues or devoid of
  them—is, for those who deliberate upon dharma, a visible divinity, O queen.”
'9': >-
  “You, who are ever devoted to dharma, who have seen the ways of the world—its
  higher and lower states—ought not to speak what is displeasing, even though
  you are sorrowful, even exceedingly sorrowful.”
'10': >-
  Hearing the king’s compassionate words, spoken in his helplessness, Kausalyā
  let her tears flow—like a channel pouring forth fresh water.
'11': >-
  Crying, and placing upon her head the king’s lotus-like joined palms, she
  spoke in agitation—frightened, hurried, and with trembling syllables.
'12': >-
  “Be gracious! I beg you with bowed head; I lie prostrate upon the ground
  before you. I have entreated you, O lord; you must not slay me—I am not to be
  slain by you.”
'13': >-
  “She is not truly a woman, O hero, worthy of praise by the wise, who does not
  win the favour of her husband in both worlds (here and hereafter).”
'14': >-
  “I know dharma, O knower of dharma; I know you to be a speaker of truth. Yet,
  afflicted by sorrow for my son, I spoke something—whatever it may have been.”
'15': >-
  “Grief destroys steadfastness; grief destroys sacred learning; grief destroys
  everything. There is no enemy equal to grief.”
'16': >-
  “A blow fallen from an enemy’s hand can be endured; but grief that has
  descended—though exceedingly subtle—cannot be borne.”
'17': >-
  “Even those who know dharma and are learned in the Veda, whose doubts
  regarding dharma and artha have been cut asunder—even ascetics, O hero, become
  bewildered when their minds are confounded by grief.”
'18': >-
  “Today a count of five nights is being reckoned for Rāma’s going to dwell in
  the forest; but to me, whose joy has been struck down by sorrow, those five
  nights are like five years.”
'19': >-
  “For me, as I keep thinking of that, this grief increases in my heart—like the
  vast waters of the ocean swelling with force, as though fed by mighty rivers.”
'20': >-
  While Kausalyā thus spoke these auspicious words, the sun’s rays grew faint,
  and night came upon them.
'21': >-
  Thus comforted by the queen Kausalyā’s words, the king—still overwhelmed by
  grief—came under the power of sleep.
'22': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-second sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Appeasement of Kausalyā.”
