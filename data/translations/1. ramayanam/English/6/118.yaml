  Now, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the one hundred
  and eighteenth sarga, called “The Sending Away of Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Rāma, beholding Maithilī who stood at his side, bowed down in reverence, began
  to utter the feeling that lay hidden within his heart.
'2': >-
  “O auspicious lady, you have been won back—having conquered the enemy on the
  field of battle. Whatever was to be accomplished by manly prowess, that has
  been brought to completion by me.”
'3': >-
  “I have reached the end of my intolerable wrath; the insult has been
  thoroughly wiped away. Both the dishonour and the foe have been slain by me at
  one and the same time.”
'4': >-
  “Today my valour has been seen; today my toil has borne fruit. Today I have
  crossed beyond my vow; today I am master of myself.”
'5': >-
  “You who were separated and carried away by a fickle-minded rākṣasa—this
  fault, brought about by fate, has been overcome by me, a mere man.”
'6': >-
  “He who does not, by his own splendour, erase the dishonour that has befallen
  him—what need has such a man, though mighty, of any ‘valour’, when his mind is
  small?”
'7': >-
  “The leaping across the ocean and the subduing of Laṅkā as well—today that
  deed of Hanumān has borne fruit, and it is worthy of praise.”
'8': >-
  “And in battle, showing prowess, and likewise offering wholesome counsel—today
  the exertion of Sugrīva together with his army has been fruitful.”
'9': >-
  “So too, today the exertion of Vibhīṣaṇa has borne fruit—he who, abandoning
  his brother who was without virtue, came of his own accord to me for refuge.”
'10': >-
  Hearing these words of Rāma as he spoke thus, Sītā, her eyes widened like
  those of a doe, became flooded with tears.
'11': >-
  Yet as Rāma looked upon her—she who was dear to his heart and stood near
  him—because of fear of the talk of people, the king’s heart became divided in
  two.
'12': >-
  Then, in the midst of the vānaras and the rākṣasas, he spoke to Sītā—she whose
  eyes were like lotus-petals, whose hair was dark and curled, the noble lady of
  fair limbs.
'13': >-
  “What is to be done by a man who would wipe away an outrage—that I have done,
  slaying Rāvaṇa, I who seek honour.”
'14': >-
  “As the southern quarter—hard to assail—was conquered by the sage Agastya,
  whose self was perfected by austerity, even so have you been won.”
'15': >-
  “Let this fatigue of battle be known to you for your good. This has been well
  endured through the valour of my friends; it was not done by me for your
  sake.”
'16': >-
  “But it was done by me, guarding my own conduct from reproach on all sides,
  and wiping away the stain upon my renowned lineage.”
'17': >-
  “Standing before me, you have become a matter of doubt as to your chastity.
  You are firmly set against me—like a lamp is to one afflicted in the eyes.”
'18': >-
  “Therefore go; today I grant you leave, O daughter of Janaka, as you wish. O
  auspicious one, these ten directions are before you; I have no further need of
  you.”
'19': >-
  “For what man, born in a noble line, being radiant with honour, would take
  back a woman who has dwelt in another’s house—his mind moved by fondness for
  kin?”
'20': >-
  “Afflicted by having rested in Rāvaṇa’s lap, and seen with the wicked eye—how
  could I take you back again, while calling my lineage great?”
'21': >-
  “That for the sake of which you were recovered by me—this has now been
  attained by me. I have no attachment toward you; go wherever you please.”
'22': >-
  “Thus, O auspicious one, this has today been spoken by me with deliberate
  resolve. Fix your mind, as may please you, upon Lakṣmaṇa, or upon Bharata.”
'23': >-
  “Or upon Śatrughna, or upon Sugrīva, or upon the rākṣasa Vibhīṣaṇa; place your
  heart, O Sītā, wherever you yourself may find happiness.”
'24': >-
  “For having seen you—of divine beauty and most charming—Rāvaṇa would not have
  endured for long, O Sītā, your remaining in his own house.”
'25': >-
  Then that proud lady, accustomed to hearing what was pleasing, hearing after
  long time those unpleasing words from her beloved, released her tears and wept
  exceedingly—like a creeper struck by the hand of a mighty elephant.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the one hundred and eighteenth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the holy
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Sending Away of Sītā.”
