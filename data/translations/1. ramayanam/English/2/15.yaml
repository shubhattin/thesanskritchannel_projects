  Now begins the fifteenth chapter in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Dispatching of Sumantra.”
'1': >-
  When that night had passed, the brāhmaṇas—versed in the Vedas—together with
  the king’s royal priest, came and duly presented themselves at the appointed
  place of attendance.
'2': >-
  The ministers, the foremost leaders of the forces, and the principal elders of
  the city as well—well united and rejoicing—assembled for the consecration of
  Rāghava.
'3': >-
  When the pure sun had risen, and on the day when Puṣya had arrived; when the
  auspicious moment had come with Cancer as the ascendant, and when the natal
  constellation of Rāma was in its proper station,
'4': >-
  the best of the twice-born had made ready everything for Rāma’s consecration:
  golden water-pitchers, and a well-adorned, auspicious seat.
'5': >-
  A chariot too was properly spread with a shining tiger-skin; and water was
  brought from the holy confluence of the Gaṅgā and Yamunā.
'6': >-
  And likewise from other sacred rivers, from pools and wells and lakes; from
  streams that flow eastward, those that flow northward, and those that flow
  crosswise; and from milky waters as well,
'7': >-
  water was brought from them, and from the oceans on every side. Honey, curds,
  ghee, parched grain, darbha-grass, fair blossoms, and milk were also made
  ready.
'8': >-
  Eight lovely maidens were in attendance, and an excellent rutting elephant;
  and jars of gold and silver—filled with water and covered with milky
  froth—were arranged.
'9': >-
  Those pitchers, furnished with lotuses and water-lilies, shone, filled with
  the finest water; and there were pale garments, bright as moonbeams when a
  lotus opens, and adorned with jewels.
'10': >-
  Ready and standing there were the finest yak-tail fans for Rāma, and also a
  pale parasol resembling the circle of the moon.
'11': >-
  Ready too were splendid, lustrous articles that precede the consecration; and
  a white bull was prepared, and a white horse stood harnessed.
'12': >-
  All musical instruments as well were prepared, and so too the panegyrists—just
  as, in the kingdom of the Ikṣvākus, a consecration is customarily arranged.
'13': >-
  Having assembled everything of that customary kind for the consecration of the
  prince, they gathered there by the king’s command, surrounding the lord of the
  earth.
'14': >-
  Not seeing him, they said: “Who now will inform our king? We do not see the
  king, though the sun has risen.”
'15': >-
  “The installation as heir-apparent of the wise Rāma is all prepared”—as they
  were thus speaking, along with all those lords of the earth,
'16': >-
  Sumantra, honored by the king, spoke to them these words: “By the king’s आदेश
  I have swiftly set out to bring Rāma.”
'17': >-
  “You are venerable to the king, and especially to Rāma. By his instruction I
  ask after your welfare and your long life.
'18': >-
  And [I shall inquire] the reason why the king, though now awakened, does not
  come forth.” Having spoken thus, that knower of ancient custom approached the
  gateway of the inner apartments.
'19': >-
  Sumantra entered that palace—ever thronged with attendants—and, upon entering
  the dwelling of the lord of men, he praised his lineage.
'20': >-
  Reaching the king’s sleeping chamber, he stood there; and drawing quite near
  to that apartment, remaining beyond the curtain-screen,
'21': >-
  he offered praise, with blessings endowed with virtues, to Rāghava—[invoking]
  Soma and Sūrya, O son of Kakutstha, and also Śiva and Vaiśravaṇa.
'22': >-
  “And may Varuṇa, Agni, and Indra grant you victory. The blessed night has
  passed; the auspicious day has arrived.
'23': >-
  Awaken, tiger among kings, and perform without delay what must be done. The
  brāhmaṇas, the foremost of the troops, and the citizens have come here.
'24': >-
  They desire your audience; awaken, O Rāghava.” While that charioteer
  Sumantra—skilled in counsel—was praising him thus,
'25': >-
  the king, then awakened, spoke these words: “Bring Rāma, O charioteer, as I
  have instructed you.”
'26': >-
  “What is this reason by which my command is being hindered? I have not fallen
  asleep again—go and quickly bring Rāghava here.”
'27': >-
  Thus King Daśaratha again directed the charioteer there. Having heard the
  king’s words, he honored him with bowed head,
'28': >-
  and went out from the royal residence, deeming it a great and welcome task. He
  entered the royal road, adorned with banners and standards,
'29': >-
  and the delighted, joyful charioteer went swiftly, looking about. There the
  charioteer heard talk concerning Rāma—
'30': >-
  talk connected with the consecration—so that all the people seemed
  exhilarated. Then he beheld the charming mansion, radiant like Kailāsa.
'31': >-
  Sumantra saw Rāma’s residence, shining like Indra’s dwelling—shut with great
  doors and adorned with projecting galleries.
'32': >-
  It had a single lofty golden image (emblem) and gateways of gems and coral; it
  gleamed like dense autumn clouds, blazing like a cave of Meru.
'33': >-
  It was richly decorated with excellent garlands of great and precious jewels;
  strewn with pearls and gems; and embellished with sandalwood and agaru.
'34': >-
  It sent forth delightful fragrances, like a mountain peak in the rainy season;
  and it was made splendid by the cries of swans and peacocks.
'35': >-
  It was filled with well-wrought images of deer, carved and inlaid, fashioned
  with devotion; and by its keen brilliance it drew the minds and eyes of living
  beings.
'36': >-
  Resembling moon and sun in splendor, like Kubera’s abode, like the dwelling of
  Mahendra, and crowded with birds of many kinds,
'37': >-
  the charioteer beheld Rāma’s house, equal to a peak of Meru—crowded with
  people standing by with hands folded in reverence.
'38': >-
  It was thronged by countryfolk pressing forward, adorned with faces uplifted
  in eager expectation of Rāma’s consecration.
'39': >-
  Lofty, exceedingly splendid, like a great cloud or a mountain; filled with
  many jewels, and surrounded even by dwarfs (attendants),
'40': >-
  the charioteer—driving a horse-yoked chariot—made the royal precincts
  resplendent, and with his chariot’s protective rails as he moved toward the
  royal house, he gladdened the hearts of the entire city.
'41': >-
  Then, reaching that exceedingly great wealth, the charioteer’s hair bristled
  with delight. The mansion—thronged and splendid with deer and peacocks—seemed
  like the house of Indra, lord of Śacī.
'42': >-
  Entering there the well-adorned courtyards, like the abodes of the gods and
  resembling Kailāsa, the charioteer, having moved aside many dear and excellent
  persons devoted to Rāma’s will, approached the inner apartments.
'43': >-
  There he also heard—filled with joy—the words of people making arrangements
  for Rāma’s consecration: delighted speech of the whole populace, uttered for
  the auspicious welfare of the king’s son.
'44': >-
  And Sumantra beheld Rāma’s lovely mansion—like Mahendra’s palace—frequented by
  deer and birds, shining like a lofty peak of Meru with its radiance.
'45': >-
  At the gateway he saw a great throng: townsmen bearing offerings and standing
  with folded hands, and countless conveyances, set down and emptied of
  passengers.
'46': >-
  Then he saw a splendid elephant, of mighty body—Rāma’s mount—like a great
  cloud or mountain, in musth, uncontrollable, very hard to restrain even with
  the goad, and a conqueror of foes.
'47': >-
  He saw also the beloved chief ministers, beautifully adorned, with their
  horses and chariots and with elephants; and the charioteer, pushing past those
  gathered all around, entered the prosperous inner palace.
'48': >-
  Then, unchecked, the charioteer entered that residence—like a mountain-peak, a
  mountain range, or a cloud—joined with lofty aerial mansions, rich in abundant
  gems, like the ocean abounding in makaras (sea-creatures).
'49': >-
  Thus ends the fifteenth chapter in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the sacred,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Dispatching of
  Sumantra.”
