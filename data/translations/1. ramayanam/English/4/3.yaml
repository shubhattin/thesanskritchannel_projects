  Now begins the third chapter, named “The Sending Forth of Hanuman,” in the
  Kishkindha Kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana. [4.3]
'1': >-
  Having understood the words of the great-souled Sugriva, Hanuman leapt down
  from Mount Rishyamuka to the place where the two descendants of Raghu were.
'2': >-
  Casting aside the form of a monkey, Hanuman—the son of the Wind-god—then
  assumed the guise of a mendicant; that monkey did so with shrewd intelligence
  (as a stratagem).
'3': >-
  Thereupon Hanuman, with speech that was gentle and exceedingly pleasing,
  approached them with humility; and having bowed down before the two—Rama and
  Lakshmana—he prostrated himself.
'4': >-
  He then addressed those two heroic princes and praised them fittingly. Having
  honored them duly according to proper rite, Hanuman—the foremost of
  monkeys—paid them reverence.
'5': >-
  Then, as he desired, he spoke to those two—mild in speech yet true in
  valor—who resembled royal sages and gods, and who, as ascetics, were steadfast
  in well-observed vows:
'6': >-
  “How have you, O fair-complexioned ones, come to this region—causing terror to
  herds of deer and to other creatures that dwell in the forest?
'7': >-
  You look about on every side at the trees growing upon the banks of the Pampa,
  and you adorn this river of auspicious waters by your very presence, O swift
  and mighty ones.
'8': >-
  Endowed with steadfastness, golden-hued, clad in bark-garments—you two
  youths—sighing deeply, O excellent-armed ones, you distress these beings here
  (by the awe you inspire).
'9': >-
  Heroic in aspect, lion-like in your gaze, of great strength and prowess,
  bearing bows like Indra’s rainbow—destroyers of foes—why have you come?
'10': >-
  Prosperous, possessed of beauty and perfect form, with the stride of the best
  of bulls; with arms like an elephant’s trunk; radiant—O best of men!
'11': >-
  This lordly mountain is lit up by your splendor. You seem worthy of kingship,
  godlike in appearance—how is it that you have come to this country?
'12': >-
  Lotus-eyed heroes, wearing circles of matted locks; alike to one another in
  form—have you come here from the world of the gods?
'13': >-
  As though by mere chance, like the Moon and the Sun arriving upon the
  earth—broad-chested heroes—human in birth yet divine in form!
'14': >-
  With shoulders like lions, of mighty energy, like two superb bulls intoxicated
  with rut; your arms are long, well-rounded, and like iron bars.
'15': >-
  Worthy of every ornament, why then are you not adorned? I deem you both fit
  indeed to protect this earth.
'16': >-
  This entire earth, with its oceans and forests, adorned with the Vindhya and
  Meru mountains—(you seem fit to rule it); and these wondrous bows, smooth and
  richly anointed,
'17': >-
  shine forth like Indra’s thunderbolts adorned with gold; and your quivers
  too—pleasing to behold—are fully filled with keen arrows.
'18': >-
  Those arrows, terrible and life-ending, are like blazing serpents; of great
  size and breadth, decorated with heated gold ornaments.
'19': >-
  And these two swords shine forth like serpents that have cast off their
  slough. Though I address you thus, why indeed do you not speak in reply to me?
'20': >-
  There is a certain righteous-souled chief of monkeys named Sugriva—heroic—who
  has been wronged by his brother and wanders sorrowfully through the world.
'21': >-
  Sent by that great-souled Sugriva, the king of the foremost monkeys, I have
  come—Hanuman by name, a monkey.
'22': >-
  That righteous Sugriva desires friendship with you both. Knowing me to be his
  minister—me, the Wind-god’s son, a monkey—he has sent me.
'23': >-
  Disguised in the form of a mendicant for the sake of what is dear to Sugriva,
  I have come here from Rishyamuka—one who can go at will and move as he
  pleases.
'24': >-
  Having thus spoken, Hanuman—who understood speech and was skilled in
  speaking—said nothing further to those two heroes, Rama and Lakshmana.
'25': >-
  Hearing his words, the illustrious Rama, his face bright with joy, said to
  Lakshmana, his brother standing by his side:
'26': >-
  “This is a minister of the great-souled Sugriva, lord of monkeys. Desiring me
  alone, he has come here into my presence.
'27': >-
  Then he addressed, O Saumitri, that monkey—Sugriva’s minister—who was skilled
  in speech, with sweet words, affectionate in tone, and a subduer of enemies.
'28': >-
  “Surely one not trained in the Rigveda, nor a bearer of the Yajurveda, nor a
  knower of the Samaveda could speak in such a manner.
'29': >-
  Indeed, this one has heard the whole of grammar in many ways. Though he has
  spoken much, not a single word has been ill-spoken.
'30': >-
  Neither in his face, nor in his eyes, nor upon his forehead, nor likewise in
  his brows—nor indeed in any other part—has any fault been perceived at all.
'31': >-
  His speech is not prolix, not doubtful, not delayed, and not agitated; it
  rises from the chest, comes through the throat, and proceeds in a measured
  tone.
'32': >-
  He utters auspicious speech that is refined, orderly in its formation,
  wondrous, and unhurried—delighting the heart.
'33': >-
  With such a marvelous voice—set with consonants in the three places of
  articulation—whose mind would not be pleased, even that of an enemy with sword
  uplifted?
'34': >-
  If a king did not have a messenger of this kind, then how, O faultless one,
  could the courses of his undertakings ever reach success?
'35': >-
  For him whose agents are endowed with such a multitude of virtues and are
  capable of accomplishing tasks—all his aims are fulfilled, urged on by the
  messenger’s words.
'36': >-
  Thus spoken to, Saumitri—himself skilled in speech—addressed that monkey,
  Sugriva’s minister: the Wind-god’s son, who too was skilled in speech.
'37': >-
  “We know, O learned one, the virtues of the great-souled Sugriva. It is
  Sugriva himself, the lord of monkeys, whom we also seek.”
'38': >-
  “As you say, O Hanuman—having come here by Sugriva’s command—so indeed shall
  we do, O best of beings, in accordance with your word.”
'39': >-
  Hearing that skillful statement of his, the monkey Hanuman—the son of the
  Wind—became radiant with delight; composing his mind toward the attainment of
  victory, he then desired to establish friendship between them both (Rama and
  Lakshmana) and Sugriva.
'40': >-
  Thus ends the third chapter, named “The Sending Forth of Hanuman,” in the
  Kishkindha Kanda of the revered Valmiki Ramayana, the primeval epic. [4.3]
