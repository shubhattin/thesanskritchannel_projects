  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the Forty-fifth Sarga,
  named “The Binding by the Nāga-pāśa (Serpent Noose).”
'1': >-
  That mighty and valiant prince Rāma, seeking to ascertain his (Indrajit’s)
  course and whereabouts, ordered ten leaders of monkey-troops.
'2': >-
  (He ordered) the two heirs of Suṣeṇa; Nīla, the lord of the monkeys; Aṅgada,
  the son of Vāli; and Śarabha, possessed of great speed and strength.
'3': >-
  And Dvivida; and Hanumān of great might, together with Sānupraṣṭha; and
  Ṛṣabha, broad-shouldered like a bull—those did the scorcher of foes command.
'4': >-
  Those monkeys, exceedingly delighted, lifting up formidable trees as weapons,
  all leapt into the sky, searching out the ten directions for him.
'5': >-
  But Rāvaṇa’s son—supremely skilled in weapons and possessed of the highest
  missiles—checked the speed of those swift ones with arrows swifter still.
'6': >-
  Those monkeys of dreadful onset, struck and wounded by iron shafts, could not
  see him in the darkness—like the sun covered over by clouds.
'7': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa’s son, the conqueror in battle, made shafts that pierced every
  limb enter deeply into the bodies of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa themselves.
'8': >-
  Those two heroes, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, were then covered all over without a
  break—by Indrajit enraged—by serpent-like missiles that had taken the form of
  arrows.
'9': >-
  Along the paths of their wounds much blood flowed forth; and the two of them
  appeared like kiṃśuka trees in bloom.
'10': >-
  Thereupon, with eyes reddened to their edges, dark like a heap of split
  collyrium, Rāvaṇa’s son, having vanished from sight, addressed the two
  brothers.
'11': >-
  Even Śakra, the lord of the thirty gods, is not able to see or even reach a
  fighter who battles unseen—how much less you two?
'12': >-
  The two Rāghavas have been caught in a net of arrows feathered like a heron’s
  wing; I, whose self is encompassed by wrath, shall now lead you to the abode
  of Yama.
'13': >-
  Having spoken thus, he pierced the righteous brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa with
  sharp arrows; and he exulted and roared aloud.
'14': >-
  Dark as a mass of crushed collyrium, stretching his vast bow wide, he again
  discharged dreadful arrows in that great battle.
'15': >-
  Then, skilled in striking vital spots, the hero drove keen arrows into the
  vulnerable points of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, and he roared again and again.
'16': >-
  Bound by the bondage of arrows, the two of them on the very forefront of
  battle could not even look about—within the space of a single blink.
'17': >-
  Then, their bodies pierced in every part, made dense with the barbs of arrows,
  they shook like the two banner-staffs of great Indra, set trembling when their
  ropes are loosed.
'18': >-
  Those two mighty archers, the lords of the earth, swayed, worn down by wounds
  that split their vital parts, and fell upon the ground.
'19': >-
  Those two heroes lay upon the heroes’ bed (the field of battle), drenched in
  blood, their entire bodies wrapped round with arrows, afflicted and grievously
  tormented.
'20': >-
  Indeed, on their limbs there was not found even the space of a finger that was
  not pierced; nor was there anything undisturbed or unbroken—from the very
  forepart of their bodies—by the serpentine shafts.
'21': >-
  Struck down thus by that cruel, shape-shifting rākṣasa, copious blood streamed
  from the two of them, like water from two mountain springs.
'22': >-
  First Rāma fell, pierced in his vital parts by the arrows—by that Indrajit
  who, in wrath, had once before conquered Śakra (Indra).
'23': >-
  With arrows whose shafts were swift as dust and whose tips were clean and
  sharp—nārācas and half-nārācas, bhallas and añjalikas too—he pierced him; and
  with vatsa-dantas, and with siṃha-daṃṣṭras, and with kṣuras likewise.
'24': >-
  He lay upon the heroes’ bed, his bow unstrung and thrown aside—its grip broken
  and circumference split, its curvature bent in three places, and adorned with
  gold.
'25': >-
  When Lakṣmaṇa saw Rāma, the bull among men, fallen there in the interval of
  the shower of arrows, he became hopeless regarding his own life.
'26': >-
  Seeing his brother fallen upon the surface of the earth—Rāma of lotus-petal
  eyes, the refuge of all, delighting in battle—Lakṣmaṇa grieved.
'27': >-
  And the monkeys too, seeing him, were overcome with the utmost anguish;
  tormented by sorrow, they cried out terribly, their eyes filled with tears.
'28': >-
  But when those two lay bound upon the heroes’ bed, the monkeys stood around
  them on every side; gathered there with Vāyu’s son (Hanumān) at their head,
  they were stricken with grief and fell into the deepest despondency.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the Forty-fifth Sarga, named “The Binding by the Nāga-pāśa,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic.
