  Now begins the forty-fourth sarga, named “Hanumān’s Message,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  But Sugrīva, in particular, spoke with a definite purpose to Hanumān; for
  regarding that foremost of monkeys, he was firmly resolved about the
  accomplishment of the task.
'2': >-
  And Sugrīva—the lord of all the forest-dwellers, exceedingly
  delighted—addressed Hanumān, the valiant son of the Wind-god, in these words.
'3': >-
  “Neither on the earth, nor in the sky, nor in the heavens, nor in the abode of
  the gods, nor even in the waters do I perceive any obstruction to your course,
  O bull among monkeys.
'4': >-
  “All the worlds are known to you—together with the asuras, gandharvas, nāgas,
  human beings, and the gods—along with the oceans, the earth, and the
  mountains.
'5': >-
  “Your speed, your swiftness, your splendour, and your lightness of movement, O
  great monkey, O hero, are like those of your father, mighty Maruta, of great
  prowess.
'6': >-
  “Indeed, in brilliance there is no being on earth equal to you. Therefore,
  reflect on that very means by which Sītā may be found.
'7': >-
  “In you alone, O Hanumān, are strength, intelligence, valour, fitness to act
  according to place and time, and policy as well—O knower of right conduct.”
'8': >-
  Then Rāghava, understanding the importance of the undertaking that rested upon
  Hanumān, and recognizing Hanumān’s capability, began to reflect.
'9': >-
  “In every way this lord of monkeys is of settled purpose concerning Hanumān;
  and Hanumān too is even more firmly resolved in accomplishing the task.”
'10': >-
  Thus, as he set forth—his ability known through his deeds, and being embraced
  and accepted by his master—the rise of the fruit of the work was assured.
'11': >-
  Beholding that great monkey, radiant and supreme in determination, he became
  as though already successful, rejoicing—his senses and mind filled with
  gladness.
'12': >-
  Then, pleased, that scorcher of foes gave him a ring as a token of
  recognition, adorned with his own name, belonging to the princess (Sītā).
'13': >-
  “By this sign, O best of monkeys, Janaka’s daughter will recognize you as one
  who has come from my presence, and she will behold you without anxiety.”
'14': >-
  “Your resolve, O hero, and your valour endowed with steadfastness—and also
  Sugrīva’s message—seem to me to proclaim success.”
'15': >-
  Receiving it, that foremost of monkeys, placing it upon his head with folded
  hands, and having bowed at the feet, set forth—the bull among leaping ones.
'16': >-
  That heroic monkey, the son of the Wind, urging forward the great strength of
  the monkeys, shone forth—like the moon in a sky cleared of clouds, its
  spotless orb adorned by a multitude of stars.
'17': >-
  “Relying on strength—O foremost of monkeys—and on immeasurable feats of
  prowess, do you, O son of the Wind, O Hanumān, so act that Janaka’s daughter
  may be found.”
'18': >-
  Thus ends the forty-fourth sarga, named “Hanumān’s Message,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
