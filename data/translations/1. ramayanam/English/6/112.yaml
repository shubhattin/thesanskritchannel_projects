  Now, in the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-twelfth sarga, called “The Lamentation of Vibhīṣaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Seeing his brother slain—lying there, defeated in battle—Vibhīṣaṇa, his soul
  overwhelmed by the rushing surge of grief, lamented aloud.
'2': >-
  “O hero, renowned for valour and prowess; O adept, skilled in policy and wise
  in counsel—why do you lie here slain upon the earth, though once you were
  borne on a most precious couch?”
'3': >-
  “Casting down your long arms—now motionless—adorned with armlets, and with
  your diadem slipped aside, shining with splendour like the sun—”
'4': >-
  “—this very end has now come to pass, O hero, which I had formerly foretold;
  yet, when you were encompassed by desire and delusion, those words did not
  please you.”
'5': >-
  “Neither from pride did you deem many a one insignificant—neither Prahasta,
  nor Indrajit, nor other warriors; not even Kumbhakarṇa, that great
  chariot-fighter; nor Atikāya, nor Narāntaka; nor did you greatly overestimate
  yourself—this is the outcome that has now arrived.”
'6': >-
  “Gone is the bridge of the well-guided; gone is the very embodiment of dharma;
  gone is the sum and substance of courage; gone is the refuge and resort of
  those of goodly hands—gone indeed!”
'7': >-
  “The sun has fallen to the earth; the moon is sunk in darkness; the many-rayed
  fire has stilled its flames; enterprise stands without effort—now that this
  hero, the foremost among weapon-bearers, has fallen upon the ground.”
'8': >-
  “What remains now of this world, bereft of its strength, when the tiger among
  rākṣasas lies on the battlefield as though asleep upon the dust?”
'9': >-
  “Like a mighty tree—the king of rākṣasas—whose tender shoots were firmness,
  whose blossoms were supreme impetuousness, whose strength was austerity, whose
  roots were bound fast by heroism—he has been crushed in battle by the
  Rāghava-wind.”
'10': >-
  “With radiance as his tusks, with noble lineage as his lineage and stem, with
  wrath and favour as the two hands of his other limbs, with a body seized by
  the lion of the Ikṣvāku race—Rāvaṇa, the fragrant elephant, lies asleep upon
  the earth.”
'11': >-
  “That mighty rākṣasa-fire—whose flame rose up as valour and enthusiasm, whose
  smoke was his harsh breathing, whose heat was the prowess of his own
  forces—has been quenched in battle by the rain-cloud that is Rāma.”
'12': >-
  “That bull among rākṣasas—having a lion and bear for tail and hump and horns,
  bearing the fragrance of victory and conquest, with restless ears and eyes—has
  been struck down by the tiger who is the lord of the earth, and now lies
  utterly fallen.”
'13': >-
  When Vibhīṣaṇa, plunged in grief, spoke thus—reasoned words, with their
  meaning clearly discerned and their purpose well determined—Rāma addressed
  him, saying:
'14': >-
  “He is not ruined, nor is he helpless; in battle his prowess was fierce. Of
  exceedingly lofty energy and courage, he has fallen—yet not through any lack
  of vigilance.”
'15': >-
  “Those established in the kṣatriya-dharma do not grieve thus when they fall;
  for they who, aspiring to glory and increase of honour, sink down on the field
  of battle—”
'16': >-
  “—he by whose wise might the three worlds together with Indra were terrified
  in war—now that he has come under the yoke of Time, this is no time for
  lamentation.”
'17': >-
  “In war, complete and one-sided victory has never at any time been seen;
  either a hero is slain by others, or in the conflict he slays others.”
'18': >-
  “This indeed is the course enjoined by the ancients and approved among
  kṣatriyas: that a kṣatriya slain in battle is not to be mourned—this is the
  settled conviction.”
'19': >-
  “Therefore, holding fast to the truth, with this certainty before you and free
  from agitation, consider in your mind what is to be done next, without delay,
  in this matter.”
'20': >-
  Thus spoken to, that valiant prince, Vibhīṣaṇa—tormented by grief—then spoke
  at once what was for his brother’s welfare.
'21': >-
  “He who in encounters had never before been broken—even by all the gods
  together, with Vāsava (Indra)—having come upon you in battle, has been broken,
  as the ocean is broken when it reaches the shoreline.”
'22': >-
  “By him were gifts bestowed upon ascetics dwelling in the forests; enjoyments
  were tasted; servants were maintained and supported; wealth was entrusted to
  friends; and hostilities against enemies were pursued and carried through.”
'23': >-
  “He is one whose fire of enmity is dreadful, and who possesses great
  austerity; he is versed in the Vedānta; and in actions he was a foremost hero.
  By your favour, I desire to perform the rites that are due for him who has
  gone to the state of the departed.”
'24': >-
  Addressed with such compassionate words by the noble Vibhīṣaṇa, the
  great-souled Rāma—undaunted in spirit—commanded that the due funeral rites,
  befitting one departed to heaven, be undertaken.
'25': >-
  “Enmities end with death; our purpose is fulfilled. Let his funeral rites be
  performed—he is to me as he is to you.”
'26': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-twelfth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the sacred
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, called “The Lamentation of Vibhīṣaṇa.”
