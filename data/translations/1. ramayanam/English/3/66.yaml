  Now begins the sixty-sixth chapter in the Aranya-kanda of the glorious Valmiki
  Ramayana, entitled “Awakening to Propriety (Occasion)”.
'1': >-
  Seeing him thus—consumed by grief—lamenting like one without refuge,
  overwhelmed by mighty delusion, utterly dejected and bereft of consciousness,
'2': >-
  then Saumitri, Lakshmana, after but a brief while, consoled him and addressed
  Rama, pressing and clasping his feet.
'3': >-
  “By great austerity indeed, and by great deeds as well, King Dasharatha won
  you—like nectar obtained by the immortals.
'4': >-
  Bound by your very virtues, and unable to bear separation from you, that lord
  of the earth—the king—attained the state of a god, as has been heard from
  Bharata.
'5': >-
  If you, O Kakutstha, will not endure this sorrow that has befallen you, what
  other man—common and of little strength—could possibly endure it?
'6': >-
  Be comforted, O best of men. What living being is there whom calamities do not
  touch? Like fire, O king, they assail, and in a moment they also pass away.
'7': >-
  If you, being afflicted, were to burn the worlds with your splendor, then
  where, O tiger among men, would the distressed subjects go to find peace?
'8': >-
  This indeed is the very nature of the world. Yayati, the son of Nahusha, went
  to share the same world as Indra, yet misfortune came into contact with him as
  well.
'9': >-
  That great sage Vasistha too—who is our father’s family priest—begot a hundred
  sons in a single day, and in the same manner they were again slain.
'10': >-
  And this Earth herself—the mother of the world, worshipped by all the
  worlds—her trembling and upheaval is seen, O lord of Kosala.
'11': >-
  Those two who are the eyes of the world, in whom all is established—the mighty
  Sun and Moon—have undergone eclipse.
'12': >-
  Even the most immense beings, and even the gods, O bull among men—no embodied
  creature at all escapes the dispensation of destiny.
'13': >-
  Among the very gods beginning with Indra, both right conduct and wrongful
  conduct are seen to occur, O tiger among men; therefore you ought not to
  grieve.
'14': >-
  Even if Vaidehi be dead, even if she be lost, O Raghava, you must not grieve,
  O hero, as any other ordinary man would.
'15': >-
  Men like you do not grieve continually—those who see all things clearly. Even
  in exceedingly great hardships, O Rama, they do not look upon matters with
  despair.
'16': >-
  Therefore, O best of men, reflect with your intellect upon the reality of
  things. The very wise, endowed with discernment, understand what is auspicious
  and what is inauspicious.
'17': >-
  For actions whose merits and faults are not evident, and which are uncertain,
  the desired result does not arise without undertaking the proper effort in
  them.
'18': >-
  For in former times, O hero, you yourself have said this to me again and
  again; for who indeed could instruct even you—save Brihaspati himself in
  person?
'19': >-
  And your intellect, O greatly wise one, is difficult even for the gods to
  follow. I am now awakening your knowledge, which has fallen asleep under the
  assault of grief.
'20': >-
  Looking to your own prowess—both divine and human—and to the bull-like
  excellence of the Ikshvaku line, strive for the slaying of your foes.
'21': >-
  What use to you, O bull among men, is the destruction of all through what has
  been done? Rather, having discerned that very sinful enemy, you ought to
  rescue her (by overcoming him).
'22': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-sixth chapter of the Aranya-kanda in the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Adikavya, entitled “Awakening to Propriety (Occasion)”.
