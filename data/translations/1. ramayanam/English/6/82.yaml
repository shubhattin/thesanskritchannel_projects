  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the eighty-second
  canto, named “Hanūmān and the others fall into despondency.”
'1': >-
  But on hearing that dreadful, terrifying roar—resounding like the thunderbolt
  of Śakra (Indra)—and looking in every direction, the Vānara hosts fled in
  great disorder.
'2': >-
  Then Hanūmān, the son of the Wind-god, spoke to them all—those Vānaras who,
  with faces cast down in dejection, wretched and alarmed, were running away
  separately in confusion.
'3': >-
  “Why do you flee, O monkeys, with downcast and despondent faces, having
  abandoned the ardour for battle? Where, indeed, has your heroism gone?”
'4': >-
  “Follow behind me as I go before you in the fight. For men of valour, born in
  a noble lineage, it is not fitting to turn back.”
'5': >-
  Thus addressed by the wise son of the Wind, they became thoroughly enraged;
  and, with hearts made glad, they seized mountain-peaks and also mighty trees.
'6': >-
  Roaring, those foremost of Vānaras sprang upon the Rākṣasas; surrounding
  Hanūmān, they followed him into that great battle.
'7': >-
  Hanūmān, encompassed on every side by those chief Vānaras, shone like a
  blazing fire and scorched the enemy host.
'8': >-
  That great monkey wrought a terrible slaughter among the Rākṣasas; surrounded
  by the Vānara army, he resembled Death, the ender of time (Kāla), even Yama
  himself.
'9': >-
  Then Hanūmān, seized by grief and inflamed with mighty wrath, hurled a huge
  rock at Rāvaṇa’s son upon his chariot.
'10': >-
  Seeing that rock falling, the chariot—yoked with obedient horses—was swiftly
  driven far away at that moment by the charioteer.
'11': >-
  Missing Indrajit who was on the chariot along with his driver, that rock,
  lifted in vain, cleft the earth and entered it.
'12': >-
  When that rock fell, the army of the Rākṣasas was shaken; and by the very
  impact of the descending rock, the Rākṣasas were violently crushed and
  confounded.
'13': >-
  Then, shouting, the forest-dwellers rushed at him by the hundreds, raising up
  great trees and also mountain-peaks.
'14': >-
  Hurling them at Indrajit in battle, the Vānaras of dreadful prowess—those
  monkeys—released a mighty shower of trees and rocks.
'15': >-
  They caused the destruction of the enemies and roared with many kinds of
  cries; and by those exceedingly terrible Vānaras, the night-wandering Rākṣasas
  of frightful aspect were smitten.
'16': >-
  Struck by trees through sheer force, the Rākṣasas writhed and moved about on
  the battlefield; and Indrajit, seeing his host harassed by the Vānaras—
'17': >-
  —grasped his weapons in anger, advanced facing his foes, and, surrounded by
  his own army, discharged torrents of arrows.
'18': >-
  Of firm and mighty valour, he slew very many tiger-like Vānaras with tridents,
  thunderbolt-like weapons, swords, axes, pikes, and mallets.
'19': >-
  And the powerful Vānaras, in the fight, struck down his followers as well,
  with stout-trunked trees, with rocks, and with great stones.
'20': >-
  Hanūmān wrought great slaughter among the Rākṣasas of terrible deeds; then,
  restraining the Vānara ranks, he spoke to those forest-dwellers.
'21': >-
  “O Vānaras, withdraw! This force is not to be overcome by us here—though we
  fight on, giving up our very lives, desiring to do what is dear to Rāma.”
'22': >-
  “For the very reason on account of which we are fighting—Janaka’s daughter has
  been slain. Having informed Rāma of this matter, and Sugrīva as well—”
'23': >-
  “—we shall do whatever course of action those two decide.” Having said this,
  that foremost of Vānaras, holding back all the Vānara hosts—
'24': >-
  —slowly and without panic, withdrew with his forces. Then, observing Hanūmān
  going to where Rāghava was—
'25': >-
  —that wicked-souled Indrajit, desiring to perform the rite, went to the sacred
  place called Nikumbhilā; and taking his seat in Nikumbhilā, he invoked the
  Fire.
'26': >-
  Then, going to the sacrificial ground, the fire invoked by that Rākṣasa blazed
  forth, at that time consuming the blood offered in the oblation.
'27': >-
  Fed with the blood of the offering and wreathed in flames, it appeared like
  the sun at twilight; a very fierce fire arose.
'28': >-
  Then Indrajit, knower of rites, offered oblations according to rule for the
  prosperity of the Rākṣasas. Seeing it, those Rākṣasas stood gathered in great
  assemblies, guiding and assisting the sacrifice.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-second canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable, sacred
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “Hanūmān and the others fall
  into despondency.”
