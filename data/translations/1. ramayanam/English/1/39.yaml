  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, the thirty-ninth sarga,
  called “The Rending of the Earth.”
'1': >-
  Having heard the words of Viśvāmitra, at the conclusion of the narration,
  Rāma, the delight of the Raghu line, exceedingly pleased, spoke to the sage
  who shone like blazing fire.
'2': >-
  “I desire to hear this story in full detail—may good befall you. O Brāhman,
  how did my forefather set about and perform that sacrifice?”
'3': >-
  Hearing his words, and being filled with curiosity, Viśvāmitra addressed that
  descendant of Kakutstha, as though smiling.
'4': >-
  “Listen, O Rāma, to the detailed account of the great-souled Sagara. There is
  Himavān, famed by name as ‘Śaṅkara’s father-in-law.’”
'5': >-
  “Approaching the Vindhya mountain, they beheld one another; and between those
  two regions, O best of men, that sacrifice took place.”
'6': >-
  “That place, O tiger among men, was highly commended for sacrificial rites.
  There, O Kakutstha, Aṁśumān, firm in bow and a great chariot-warrior,
  undertook the guarding of the sacrificial horse, abiding by Sagara’s command.”
'7': >-
  “In accordance with Sagara’s intention, dear one, Aṁśumān kept watch. But at
  the stated sacrificial time, Vāsava (Indra), while Sagara was performing the
  rite,”
'8': >-
  “assumed a rākṣasī form and carried off the consecrated sacrificial horse. And
  when that horse of the great-souled king was being borne away, O Kakutstha,”
'9': >-
  “all the officiating priests then spoke to the sacrificer: ‘At this appointed
  time, the sacrificial horse is being swiftly taken away!’”
'10': >-
  “‘Slay the thief, O Kakutstha, and let the horse be brought back. This will
  become a flaw in the sacrifice—bringing misfortune upon us all.’”
'11': >-
  “‘Let it be done thus, O King; otherwise the sacrifice will be marred.’ Having
  heard the counsel of the priests in that assembly, the ruler of the earth”
'12': >-
  “spoke these words to his sixty thousand sons: ‘O bull-like heroes among men,
  I do not perceive the course taken by the rākṣasas.’”
'13': >-
  “‘This great sacrifice, sanctified by mantras and presided over by highly
  blessed priests, has been undertaken. Therefore go and search, my sons—may
  good be yours!’”
'14': >-
  “‘Traverse the entire earth, girdled by the ocean. Let each of you take a
  stretch of one yojana in breadth.’”
'15': >-
  “‘So long as the horse is not seen, dig into the earth—cleave the
  ground—seeking that very horse-stealer by my command.’”
'16': >-
  “‘I, consecrated for the rite, along with my grandson and accompanied by the
  company of priests, shall remain here—may good be yours—until the sight of the
  horse is obtained.’”
'17': >-
  Those mighty princes, all of them glad at heart, went forth over the face of
  the earth, O Rāma, constrained by their father’s command.
'18': >-
  But having gone throughout the whole earth and not seeing that horse, those
  mighty ones—each taking a yojana’s measure—split open the surface of the
  ground. Those tiger-like men, with arms like the touch of a thunderbolt, tore
  the earth asunder.
'19': >-
  With pikes like lightning-bolts, and with ploughs exceedingly dreadful, as the
  earth was being cleft, she roared aloud, O joy of the Raghu race.
'20': >-
  There arose, O Rāghava, a dreadful din of nāgas being slain, of asuras, and of
  rākṣasas—of other creatures too, hard to assail.
'21': >-
  For sixty thousand yojanas, O Raghunandana, they split the earth, O Rāma, down
  into the excellent Rasātala (nether region).
'22': >-
  Thus, digging all around Jambūdvīpa, crowded with mountains, the king’s sons,
  O tiger among kings, roamed on every side.
'23': >-
  Then all the gods, with the gandharvas, along with the asuras and the pannagas
  (serpents), their minds alarmed, approached Pitāmaha (Brahmā).
'24': >-
  Having sought the favor of that great-souled Lord, with downcast faces, they
  then spoke—utterly terrified—these words to Pitāmaha:
'25': >-
  “O Blessed One, the entire earth is being dug up by Sagara’s sons, and many
  great beings—those that move in the waters—are being slain.”
'26': >-
  “‘This one is the stealer of our sacrifice; by him the horse has been carried
  away’—thus thinking, Sagara’s sons are injuring all classes of beings.”
'27': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-ninth sarga, entitled “The Rending of the Earth,” in the
  Bāla-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
