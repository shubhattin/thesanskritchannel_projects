  Now begins the Fortieth Sarga in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Citizens Following (Rāma) from the City.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, and Sītā, and Lakṣmaṇa, with palms joined in reverence, embraced
  the king and—grief-stricken—went around him in circumambulation.
'2': >-
  And having also sought his permission, the righteous Rāghava—though
  overwhelmed by sorrow—together with Sītā, bowed to his mother.
'3': >-
  Thereafter Lakṣmaṇa, following his elder brother, bowed to Kauśalyā; and again
  he clasped the feet of his own mother Sumitrā.
'4': >-
  Seeing Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) bowing thus, his mother—herself weeping, desiring
  his welfare—kissed the mighty-armed Lakṣmaṇa upon the head and spoke to him.
'5': >-
  “You are set forth for dwelling in the forest, devoted as you are to your
  beloved kinsmen and friends. Do not be heedless, my son, with regard to Rāma,
  as your brother goes (on this path).”
'6': >-
  “Whether he meets with calamity or with prosperity, in him lies your course, O
  sinless one. This is the dharma of the good in this world: that one should be
  obedient to the will of the elder.”
'7': >-
  “For this indeed is the fitting and ancient custom of this lineage:
  generosity, consecration in sacrifices, and the giving up of one’s body in
  battle.”
'8': >-
  Having thus spoken to Lakṣmaṇa, Sumitrā—having fully composed herself for the
  sake of her dear Rāghava—said to him again and again, “Go, go.”
'9': >-
  “Know Rāma to be your Daśaratha; know me to be the daughter of Janaka. Know
  Ayodhyā to be the forest. Go, dear child, as happily as you may.”
'10': >-
  Then Sumantra, with palms joined, spoke to the Kakutstha, humble and
  well-versed in propriety—like Mātali to Vāsava (Indra).
'11': >-
  “Mount the chariot—good be to you, O prince of great renown. Quickly shall I
  convey you, O Rāma, to wherever you bid me.”
'12': >-
  “For fourteen years you must dwell in the forest; those years must now be
  entered upon, as you have been urged by the queen.”
'13': >-
  Then Sītā, the fair-hipped lady, with a delighted heart, having adorned
  herself, mounted that chariot which shone like the sun.
'14': >-
  And Daśaratha gave Sītā—who was to follow her husband—clothes and ornaments,
  considering the life in the forest.
'15': >-
  Likewise he placed upon the chariot-seat weapons of various kinds, and armor
  for the two brothers, together with a tough leather (gear) with its straps
  duly arranged.
'16': >-
  Then the two brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, quickly mounted (the chariot),
  blazing like fire and adorned with gold.
'17': >-
  Seeing them seated with Sītā as the third, Sumantra urged on the well-matched
  horses, swift as the wind in their speed.
'18': >-
  But when Rāghava set forth toward the great wilderness, as though into a long
  night, a swoon came upon the city and upon the people—a very faintness of
  strength.
'19': >-
  That city became a great roar—confused and agitated—like an intoxicated,
  enraged elephant, resounding with the jingling of horses’ trappings.
'20': >-
  Then that city—together with children and the aged—terribly afflicted, ran
  only after Rāma, as one tormented by heat runs to water.
'21': >-
  Hanging on at his sides and even behind, all turning their faces toward him,
  their mouths filled with tears, they spoke with exceedingly loud lamentation:
'22': >-
  “Restrain the reins of the horses, O charioteer; go slowly, slowly. The face
  of Rāma will become hard for us to behold (if you go fast).”
'23': >-
  “Surely the heart of Rāma’s mother is of iron—without doubt—since it does not
  break though he, like a divine embryo in beauty, is going to the forest.”
'24': >-
  “Indeed Vaidehī is fulfilled in her purpose—like a shadow she follows her
  husband; devoted to dharma, she does not abandon him, like the radiance of the
  sun never leaving Meru.”
'25': >-
  “Ah, Lakṣmaṇa, you are successful indeed—you who will ever attend upon your
  elder brother, the godlike one, who always speaks what is dear.”
'26': >-
  “Great indeed is this resolve of yours, and great is this rising of fortune.
  This is the path to heaven as well—that you follow him.”
'27': >-
  Speaking thus, those men could not bear the tears that rose (in them); and
  they followed that beloved delight of the Ikṣvāku line.
'28': >-
  Then the king, surrounded by sorrowing women, his own mind sunk in grief, came
  out of the palace saying, “I shall see my dear son.”
'29': >-
  And ahead there was heard the great sound of women weeping—like the cry of
  she-elephants when a mighty elephant is bound.
'30': >-
  Indeed the royal father, the illustrious Kakutstha (Daśaratha), then appeared
  as though sunk—like the full moon at its time eclipsed by a ग्रह (the seizing
  planet).
'31': >-
  And that illustrious Rāma, Daśaratha’s son, of inconceivable spirit, urged the
  charioteer, saying, “Drive on swiftly.”
'32': >-
  The charioteer was urged on the road by both—by Rāma saying “Go,” and by the
  people likewise saying “Stop”; and he was unable to do both.
'33': >-
  As the mighty-armed Rāma went forth, the dust of the earth—checked by the
  citizens’ tears that had fallen—vanished (was laid).
'34': >-
  At Rāghava’s departure, the city—stunned, crying “Alas, alas!”, drained by
  weeping tears—was exceedingly afflicted.
'35': >-
  From the women’s eyes streamed tears born of weariness—like water among
  lotuses shaken by the stirring of fish.
'36': >-
  But seeing the illustrious king, and the city fixed upon a single thought, he
  fell down in grief like a tree cut at the root.
'37': >-
  Then behind Rāma there arose the cry “Halahalā!”—as men looked upon the king
  sinking down, grievously distressed.
'38': >-
  Some people cried, “Ah, Rāma!” and others, “Rāma’s mother!” and they lamented,
  wailing over the inner apartments rich with women (in turmoil).
'39': >-
  Rāma, looking back, saw along the road the king and his mother, dejected and
  with minds bewildered, following after (him).
'40': >-
  As though a young calf were bound by a rope to its mother, so was he joined to
  them by the bonds of dharma; and he did not look openly (ahead with ease).
'41': >-
  Seeing them—who should have gone in a vehicle, accustomed to happiness,
  unworthy of such sorrow, now going on foot—he urged the charioteer: “Go
  quickly!”
'42': >-
  For that tiger among men had no power to endure the sorrow-born sight of his
  father and his mother—like an elephant prodded by goads.
'43': >-
  Like a cow returning to the cowshed for the sake of her calf—her calf
  restrained—so did Rāma’s mother run after him.
'44': >-
  So too Kauśalyā, weeping, ran after that chariot, crying, “Rāma, Rāma!” and
  “Alas, Sītā! Lakṣmaṇa!”
'45': >-
  And he again and again looked at that mother of his, from whose eyes water
  flowed for Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and Sītā, as she ran—like one dancing (in
  distraction).
'46': >-
  The king shouted “Stop!” while Rāghava cried “Go, go!”—and Sumantra’s very
  self was as though caught between the two wheels.
'47': >-
  Rāma said to him: “Though reproached, you will say to the king, ‘I did not
  hear.’ Most sinful would it be—for a long time—(to be the cause) of this
  grief.”
'48': >-
  Doing Rāma’s bidding, and taking leave of the people as well, the charioteer
  quickly urged on the horses—even as they were moving.
'49': >-
  The people, having circumambulated Rāma, turned back toward the king; yet in
  mind they did not turn back from the man (Rāma) rushing on at swift speed.
'50': >-
  The ministers spoke these words to the great king Daśaratha: “Whomever one
  wishes to return again, one should not follow that person too far.”
'51': >-
  Hearing their words, the king—endowed with every virtue, his limbs sweating,
  his countenance utterly dejected—wretched, together with his queens, stood
  still, his gaze fixed upon that son.
'52': >-
  Thus ends the Fortieth Sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the first epic, entitled “The Citizens Following (Rāma)
  from the City.”
