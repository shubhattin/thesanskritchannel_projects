  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the sixty-eighth
  canto, named “The Funeral Rites of Jaṭāyu.”
'1': >-
  But Rāma, beholding that vulture struck down upon the ground through the
  ferocity of battle, spoke these words to Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), his companion
  and well-wisher.
'2': >-
  Surely this bird, striving on my behalf, has been slain in combat by a
  rākṣasa, and for my sake he is now giving up his very life-breath.
'3': >-
  The life within this body is exceedingly spent, O Lakṣmaṇa; and this one,
  bereft of voice, looks about in weakness and distress.
'4': >-
  O Jaṭāyu, if you are able to utter words once more, tell me, I pray
  you—declare to me about Sītā, and also relate the manner of your own death.
'5': >-
  For what reason did Rāvaṇa carry off the noble lady? And what offence of mine
  did Rāvaṇa perceive, on account of which my beloved was taken away by him?
'6': >-
  How was that moonlike, charming face of Sītā then? And what words were spoken
  by Sītā at that time, O best of birds?
'7': >-
  What was the prowess of that rākṣasa, what his form, and what were his deeds?
  And where, dear one, is his dwelling? Tell me, for I ask you.
'8': >-
  Beholding Rāma lamenting like one without a protector, that righteous Jaṭāyu
  spoke to Rāma in a faltering voice, saying:
'9': >-
  “She has been carried off by the lord of rākṣasas, the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa,
  who resorted to vast illusion, amid a scene confused like a storm and a day of
  darkness.
'10': >-
  “After cutting off my wings, dear one, while I was exhausted, that
  night-ranger, taking Vaidehī (Sītā), set forth facing south.”
'11': >-
  “My life-breaths are being obstructed; my sight is reeling, O Rāghava. I see
  golden trees, as though their crests were fashioned of uśīra-grass.”
'12': >-
  “By the time in which Rāvaṇa goes, taking Sītā away, in that very time lost
  wealth is quickly regained by its owner.”
'13': >-
  “That moment is called Vinda; and you, O scion of Kakutstha, did not realize
  it. Having seized your beloved Jānakī, Rāvaṇa, lord of rākṣasas, will swiftly
  perish—like a fish that has swallowed a hook.”
'14': >-
  “And you should not feel anguish on account of Janaka’s daughter. You will
  soon rejoice with Vaidehī, after slaying him on the forefront of battle.”
'15': >-
  As that vulture, not bewildered, thus spoke to Rāma, blood, mixed with flesh,
  flowed forth from his mouth as he was dying.
'16': >-
  “He is the son of Viśravas directly, and the brother of Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera) as
  well.” Having said this, the lord of birds released his hard-to-surrender
  life-breath.
'17': >-
  While Rāma, with joined palms, kept imploring, “Speak, speak!”, the vulture’s
  life departed, leaving behind his body, and went up to the heavens.
'18': >-
  He set his head down upon the earth, stretched out his feet, and, his body
  thrown apart, fell upon the ground.
'19': >-
  Seeing that copper-eyed vulture—lifeless and like an immovable mountain—Rāma,
  afflicted with many griefs, spoke dejectedly to Saumitri.
'20': >-
  “Having dwelt for many years happily in the abode of rākṣasas, this bird has
  here, in the Daṇḍaka forest, been brought to ruin.”
'21': >-
  “He who lived many years, and had risen up after a long time—he now lies slain
  today. Time indeed is hard to overstep.”
'22': >-
  “Behold, O Lakṣmaṇa—this vulture, my benefactor, has been slain because he
  confronted Rāvaṇa, the mighty one, in the matter of Sītā’s abduction.”
'23': >-
  “Abandoning the great kingdom of vultures, inherited from father and
  forefathers, this lord of birds has given up his life-breath for my sake.”
'24': >-
  “Everywhere, indeed, are seen the good—those who walk in dharma—heroic and
  worthy of refuge, O Saumitri, even among creatures born in the animal kind.”
'25': >-
  “The sorrow born of Sītā’s abduction has not come upon me so intensely, O
  gentle one, as has this destruction of the vulture for my sake, O tormentor of
  foes.”
'26': >-
  “As the illustrious king Daśaratha, my highly renowned father, was worthy of
  worship and honour—so too is this lord of birds.”
'27': >-
  “O Saumitri, bring the firewood; I shall churn forth the sacred fire. I shall
  cremate the king of vultures who, for my sake, has met with death.”
'28': >-
  “I shall place upon the funeral pyre this protector of the bird-world. O
  Saumitri, I shall burn this one, slain by that fierce rākṣasa.”
'29': >-
  “May the course that belongs to those devoted to sacrifices, and the course of
  those who have maintained the sacred fires; the course of those who do not
  turn back (from righteous duty); and the course of those who bestow land—be
  yours.”
'30': >-
  “By me you are granted leave; go to the unsurpassed worlds. O king of
  vultures, great-souled one—go, having been duly honoured and consecrated by
  me.”
'31': >-
  Having thus spoken, the righteous-souled Rāma, sorrowing as though for his own
  kinsman, placed the lord of birds upon the blazing pyre and burned him.
'32': >-
  Then Rāma, together with Saumitri, that mighty man, went into the forest; and
  after slaying large, great deer, he paid honour to that twice-born one
  (Jaṭāyu).
'33': >-
  Cutting out the venison and making it into portions, the greatly renowned Rāma
  gave it, in a beautiful place with green grass, as an offering to the bird.
'34': >-
  That which the twice-born declare regarding a dead mortal—namely, that
  ancestral rite which leads to heaven—that Rāma then recited for him.
'35': >-
  Thereafter, going to the river Godāvarī, the two sons of the best of men
  performed the water-oblation for that king of vultures.
'36': >-
  According to the method seen in the śāstras, the two Rāghavas, having bathed,
  then offered water to the king of vultures.
'37': >-
  That king of vultures, fallen in battle, had performed a deed exceedingly
  difficult, and bringing renown; and then, honoured with rites as though he
  were a great seer, he attained his own auspicious, meritorious state.
'38': >-
  And those two also, having completed the water-oblation to the best of birds,
  and fixing firm resolve, set their minds thereafter upon the finding of Sītā,
  and went into the forest—like Viṣṇu and Vāsava (Indra).
'39': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-eighth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the first epic, entitled “The Funeral Rites of
  Jaṭāyu.”
