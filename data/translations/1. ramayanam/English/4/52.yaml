  Now begins the fifty-second sarga in the Kishkindha-kanda of the glorious
  Valmiki Ramayana, entitled “The narration of the cause for entering the cave.”
'1': >-
  Then that ascetic woman, devoted to righteousness, spoke this speech to all
  those monkey-chiefs who had rested, her mind composed and attentive.
'2': >-
  “O monkeys, if your weariness has been dispelled by eating fruits, and if this
  is something that should be heard by me, I desire to hear that account.”
'3': >-
  Hearing her words, Hanuman, the son of the Wind-god, began to relate the
  matter truthfully, with straightforwardness, just as it had occurred.
'4': >-
  “Rama, the illustrious son of Dasharatha—king of all the world, comparable to
  Indra and Varuna—has entered the Dandaka forest.
'5': >-
  With his brother Lakshmana, and with his wife Vaidehi, he dwelt there; and his
  wife was forcibly abducted from Janasthana by Ravana.
'6': >-
  “Sugriva by name, a monkey, the valorous friend of that king, is the lord of
  the foremost of monkeys—he is the one who dispatched us.
'7': >-
  “Along with these foremost monkeys, headed by Angada, we have come to the
  southern quarter—the region traversed by Agastya and guarded by Yama.
'8': >-
  “All of us together were commanded: ‘Search for Ravana, the rakshasa who can
  assume forms at will, along with Sita Vaidehi.’”
'9': >-
  Having searched through the entire forest and the ocean in the southern
  direction, we all, tormented by hunger, took refuge at the foot of a tree.
'10': >-
  All of us had pallid faces; all were intent on brooding; we could not find any
  way out, plunged into the great ocean of anxiety.
'11': >-
  Then, casting our eyes about, we saw a vast cave, concealed by creepers and
  trees, and enveloped in darkness.
'12': >-
  From it, birds flew out—swans with wings drenched in water and sprinkled with
  watery dust, and also curlews and sarasas.
'13': >-
  Thereupon I said to the monkeys, ‘Let us enter here’; and indeed, the same
  inference occurred to all of them as well.
'14': >-
  All of us, urged on by haste to accomplish our task, descended into it; and
  then, entering closely and firmly, we went down grasping one another’s hands.
'15': >-
  Thus we suddenly entered this cave, covered in darkness. We had come upon this
  action as our very business—this was what we undertook.
'16': >-
  “And all of us, exhausted and hungry, then approached you; and you gave us
  roots and fruits, granted in accordance with the law of hospitality.
'17': >-
  Those were eaten by us, oppressed by hunger; and you protected us all as we
  were perishing from hunger.
'18': >-
  “Tell us, for the sake of repaying your kindness—what should these monkeys do
  for you?” Thus addressed, that all-knowing woman, Swayamprabha, replied to
  those monkeys.
'19': >-
  Then she answered all those leaders of monkey-bands: “I am fully satisfied
  with all of you swift and mighty monkeys.
'20': >-
  As I live here following my dharma, there is no service to be done for me by
  anyone.” When that auspicious, righteous speech of the ascetic was thus
  spoken,
'21': >-
  Hanuman spoke to her—she whose eyes were faultless: “We all have sought refuge
  in you, O woman who walks in dharma.
'22': >-
  The appointed time fixed for us by the great-souled Sugriva has passed by
  while we have been wandering within the cave.
'23': >-
  Therefore you ought to rescue us from this cave—us who have exceeded the time
  given by Sugriva’s command, as though our very life-term were spent.
'24': >-
  “You should save all of us, who are apprehensive and afraid of Sugriva; and
  there is a great task to be accomplished by us, O righteous lady.
'25': >-
  And that task has not been accomplished by us, dwelling here.” Thus spoken to
  by Hanuman, the ascetic said these words:
'26': >-
  “I deem it difficult for one who has entered to return alive, save by the
  excellent power of austerity and by the merit acquired through observances.
'27': >-
  By that power I shall indeed deliver all you monkeys from this cave. Close
  your eyes, all you foremost of monkeys!
'28': >-
  For it is not possible to go out with the eyes unclosed.” Then all of them
  closed their eyes with their tender-fingered hands,
'29': >-
  And suddenly covered their sight, delighted with the desire to depart; and
  those great-souled monkeys then had their mouths and faces covered by their
  hands.
'30': >-
  In the space of but a moment, she brought them out from the cave. Thereupon
  the ascetic, devoted to dharma, spoke to them all there.
'31': >-
  Having comforted them after they had emerged from that perilous place, she
  said this: “This is the glorious Vindhya mountain, filled with many kinds of
  trees and creepers.
'32': >-
  This is the Prasravana mountain; this is the ocean, the great sea. May welfare
  be yours. I shall go to my dwelling, O bull-like monkeys.” Having spoken thus,
  Swayamprabha entered again into that splendid cave.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-second sarga in the Kishkindha-kanda of the revered
  Valmiki Ramayana, the ancient epic, entitled “The narration of the cause for
  entering the cave.”
