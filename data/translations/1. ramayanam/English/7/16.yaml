  Now begins the sixteenth canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “How Rāvaṇa Obtained His Name.”
'1': >-
  Having conquered Kubera, O Rāma, that lord of rākṣasas set out for the great
  Śaravaṇa forest, the birthplace of a mighty army.
'2': >-
  Then Daśagrīva beheld that great Śaravaṇa—golden-hued, covered with a network
  of sunbeams, like a second Sun.
'3': >-
  Ascending a certain mountain within a delightful woodland region, he saw there
  the Puṣpaka aerial car, then held fast and obstructed.
'4': >-
  Seeing the Puṣpaka thus checked—though fashioned to go at will and move as one
  desires—the lord of rākṣasas, surrounded by his ministers, reflected.
'5': >-
  “For what reason is this Puṣpaka not going by my mere wish? This must be the
  doing of someone upon the summit of this mountain.”
'6': >-
  Then Mārīca, skilled in counsel, spoke to him, O Rāma: “This is not without
  cause, O king, that the Puṣpaka does not go.”
'7': >-
  “Or else, this Puṣpaka belongs to Kubera and is no other’s vehicle; therefore
  it has become motionless, its lord of wealth being removed.”
'8': >-
  While he was speaking thus, there appeared a dreadful being—black and
  tawny-eyed; a dwarf, misshapen, shaven-headed—Nandī, of mighty strength and
  reverent, bent arms.
'9': >-
  Then, approaching his side, that attendant of Bhava spoke—Nandīśvara—without
  fear, addressing the lord of rākṣasas with these words:
'10': >-
  “Turn back, Daśagrīva! On this mountain Śaṅkara is at play. It has been made
  inaccessible to all beings—to Garuḍas, Nāgas, Yakṣas, to Devas, Gandharvas,
  and Rākṣasas.”
'11': >-
  Hearing the words of Nandī, his earrings trembling with anger, he was shaken
  with wrath.
'12': >-
  Then, his copper-red eyes inflamed, he descended from the Puṣpaka and, saying,
  “Who is this Śaṅkara?”, went up to the foot of the mountain.
'13': >-
  There he saw Nandī standing at a distance, as the god’s sentinel—leaning upon
  a blazing trident, like a second Śaṅkara.
'14': >-
  Seeing him, the rākṣasa despised that monkey-faced one and burst into laughter
  there, like a cloud rumbling with rain.
'15': >-
  Then the blessed Nandī—another embodiment of Śaṅkara—angered, spoke there to
  that rākṣasa, Daśānana, who stood before him:
'16': >-
  “Because, O Daśānana, you have scorned me for my monkey-form and have let
  loose mockery like a thunderbolt,”
'17': >-
  “therefore monkeys, endowed with my form, equal to my valor and my radiance,
  shall arise indeed for the destruction of your lineage.”
'18': >-
  “Armed with nails and fangs, cruel, swift as the flight of thought; mad for
  battle, swollen with strength—ranging like mountains on the move—”
'19': >-
  “they shall together shatter your mighty pride and your many kinds of
  arrogance, along with your ministers and your sons.”
'20': >-
  “But what can I do now to slay you, O night-roamer? You are not to be
  slain—for you have already been struck down beforehand by your own deeds.”
'21': >-
  When those words were uttered by that great-souled divine being, celestial
  kettledrums resounded, and a rain of flowers fell from the sky.
'22': >-
  But that mighty one, giving no thought to Nandī’s words, approached the
  mountain and spoke, Daśānana saying:
'23': >-
  “Because of you, O guardian of the bull, the course of my Puṣpaka has been
  obstructed as I was going. I shall uproot this very mountain!”
'24': >-
  “By what power does Bhava ever sport here like a king? He does not know that a
  source of fear has come upon him and must be recognized.”
'25': >-
  Having spoken thus, O Rāma, he flung out his arms against the mountain and
  swiftly began to lift it; the mountain shook evenly.
'26': >-
  By the very shaking of the mountain, the gaṇas of the god were disturbed; and
  Pārvatī too was shaken, then clinging fast to Maheśvara.
'27': >-
  Then, O Rāma, the great god—Hara, foremost among the gods—pressed that
  mountain down with the tip of his toe, as if in sport.
'28': >-
  Pressed thus, the arms of that one that had gone beneath the mountain were
  crushed; and there the rākṣasa’s ministers were struck with astonishment.
'29': >-
  Then, from that rākṣasa—through rage and from the crushing of his arms—there
  burst forth suddenly a cry, by which the three worlds were shaken.
'30': >-
  His ministers deemed it a pounding as of a thunderbolt at the end of an age;
  and the gods, led by Indra, began to move along their paths in alarm.
'31': >-
  The oceans too were churned into tumult, and the mountains trembled and
  shifted; Yakṣas, Vidyādharas, and Siddhas said, “What is this?”
'32': >-
  Then his ministers spoke to him as he cried out: “Propitiate
  Mahādeva—Nīlakaṇṭha, the consort of Umā!”
'33': >-
  “We see no other refuge here for you, O Daśānana. Bow with praises and go to
  him alone for shelter.”
'34': >-
  “Śaṅkara is compassionate; if pleased, he will grant you favor.” Thus
  addressed by his ministers, he praised the Bull-bannered Lord.
'35': >-
  Daśānana, bowing with various hymns and conciliatory chants, spent a full
  thousand years in weeping as a rākṣasa.
'36': >-
  Then, pleased, Mahādeva—the Lord standing upon the mountain peak—released his
  arms, and spoke to Daśānana these words, O Rāma:
'37': >-
  “I am pleased with your valor and your bold hardihood, O Daśānana, and with
  that exceedingly dreadful roar that you uttered while pressed beneath the
  mountain.”
'38': >-
  “Because this triple world was made to cry out in terror by it, therefore you,
  O king, shall be named ‘Rāvaṇa’.”
'39': >-
  “Gods, men, Yakṣas, and all others upon the face of the earth shall thus call
  you—Rāvaṇa, the one whose roar makes the worlds cry out.”
'40': >-
  “Go, O Paulastya, confidently, by whatever path you desire; by me you are
  permitted—depart, O lord of rākṣasas.”
'41': >-
  Thus spoken to by Śambhu, the lord of Laṅkā himself replied: “If you are
  pleased, O Mahādeva, grant me a boon, for I ask it.”
'42': >-
  “Let me attain inviolability—against Devas, Gandharvas, Dānavas; against
  rākṣasas, Guhyakas, Nāgas, and others who are stronger.”
'43': >-
  “As for humans, O god, I do not count them—small they are in my judgment. And,
  O Destroyer of the Three Cities, I have obtained long life from Brahmā.”
'44': >-
  “And grant me, for the remainder of my life as I desire, a weapon as well.”
  Thus spoken by Rāvaṇa, Śaṅkara replied.
'45': >-
  The Lord of beings then gave him a sword, exceedingly radiant, renowned as
  ‘Candrāhāsa,’ and also granted him the remaining span of life.
'46': >-
  After giving it, Śambhu said: “This must not be slighted by you. For if you do
  slight it, it will surely come upon me alone (as the witness and consequence
  of your contempt).”
'47': >-
  Thus named by Maheśvara himself, that Rāvaṇa bowed to Mahādeva and then
  mounted the Puṣpaka.
'48': >-
  Then upon the earth, O Rāma, Rāvaṇa ranged about, harassing on every side the
  most mighty and heroic kṣatriyas.
'49': >-
  Some kṣatriyas—brilliant, heroic, and mad with battle—refused to obey his
  command and perished, together with their retinues and equipment.
'50': >-
  Others, deemed wise, knowing the rākṣasa to be unconquerable, said, “We are
  conquered,” to that rākṣasa intoxicated with the pride of strength.
'51': >-
  Thus ends the sixteenth canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  Ādikāvya, entitled “How Rāvaṇa Obtained His Name.”
