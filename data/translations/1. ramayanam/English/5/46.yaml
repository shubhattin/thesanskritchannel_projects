  Now begins the forty-sixth canto in the auspicious Sundara Kāṇḍa of the
  glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Slaying of the Five Commanders of the
  Army.”
'1': >-
  Having learnt that the sons of his ministers had been slain by that
  great-souled Vānara, Rāvaṇa—his countenance drawn tight with suppressed
  wrath—formed a most resolute decision.
'2': >-
  He (summoned) Virūpākṣa and Yūpākṣa, and also the hard-to-overcome rākṣasa
  named Durdhara, as well as Praghasa and Bhāsakarṇa—five leaders who marched at
  the head of the army.
'3': >-
  Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa) commanded those heroes, skilled in statecraft and policy,
  to be unwavering in the task of capturing Hanumān, and to be in battle equal
  in speed to the wind.
'4': >-
  “Go forth—all of you who lead the vanguard, endowed with great strength;
  accompanied by horses, chariots, and elephants—let that Vānara be brought
  under control,” (said he).
'5': >-
  “Whatever must be done by you—having reached that dweller in the forest—let
  the deed be carried out in a manner not opposed to place and time.”
'6': >-
  “For, weighing his actions, I do not at all regard that monkey as a mere
  creature; in every way he appears to be something extraordinary, possessed of
  immense might.”
'7': >-
  “Even though it is known, ‘He is a Vānara,’ my mind does not become at ease.
  Indeed, I do not deem him a mere monkey, as this matter has unfolded.”
'8': >-
  “He may have been created by Indra himself, through the power of austerity,
  for our sake (to bring us to ruin)—(he who can contend with) Nāgas, Yakṣas,
  Gandharvas, Devas, Asuras, and great ṛṣis.”
'9': >-
  “By all of you, who have been dispatched (in former encounters), together with
  me, they have been conquered; therefore they will surely contrive for us some
  deception or harm.”
'10': >-
  “This alone is certain—there is no doubt here: seize him forcibly and take
  him. Go forth, all you leaders of the vanguard, possessed of great strength.”
'11': >-
  “With horses, chariots, and elephants, let that Vānara be subdued. Do not
  treat him with contempt; that monkey is steady and mighty in prowess.”
'12': >-
  “For I have previously seen Vānaras of vast valor—Vālī with Sugrīva, and
  Jāmbavān too, of great strength,”
'13': >-
  “Nīla the commander of the army, and others such as Dvivida; yet in them there
  was not such dreadful speed, nor such splendor, nor such power of assault,”
'14': >-
  “Nor such intelligence, nor such strength and ardor, nor such capacity to
  assume forms at will. This is to be known as a great and uncommon being,
  established in the form of a monkey.”
'15': >-
  “Taking up great effort, accomplish his restraint. Even though the three
  worlds with Indra—together with gods, asuras, and men—”
'16': >-
  “—are not sufficient to stand before you on the battlefield, still, seeking
  victory in war through knowledge of policy,”
'17': >-
  “one must strive to guard oneself, for success in battle is fickle.” Having
  thus received their lord’s command, all those of mighty energy—
'18': >-
  —sprang forth with great speed, blazing like fire, mounted upon chariots, upon
  rutting elephants, and upon horses of tremendous swiftness,
'19': >-
  well furnished with every host of forces and with diverse, sharp weapons. Then
  those heroes beheld the great Vānara, shining in radiance.
'20': >-
  He was like the rising sun, wreathed in the rays of his own splendor—stationed
  upon the gateway-tower (toraṇa), of great speed, great might, and great
  strength.
'21': >-
  He was of great understanding and great ardor, of massive body and mighty
  arms. Having only looked upon him, all of them took their positions in all the
  directions.
'22': >-
  Then, from various sides, they rushed upon him with fearsome weapons of many
  kinds. Five sharp iron arrows—white, with yellowish faces, lotus-petal-like at
  the head—were shot by Durdhara and struck him on the head.
'23': >-
  Pierced on the head by those five arrows, the Vānara sprang up, roaring in the
  sky and making the ten directions resound.
'24': >-
  Then the heroic Durdhara, standing in his chariot with bow made ready, that
  mighty one advanced, showering him with hundreds upon hundreds of arrows.
'25': >-
  That Vānara checked him in midair as he rained arrows—just as the Wind-god
  checks a cloud at the end of the rainy season, laden with rain.
'26': >-
  Struck and harried by Durdhara, the son of the Wind (Hanumān) roared again and
  again, and his valor only grew the more.
'27': >-
  Leaping far in a single bound, that swift Vānara fell upon Durdhara’s chariot
  with great speed, like a mass of lightning crashing upon a mountain.
'28': >-
  His chariot, its eight horses crushed and its axle and yoke broken, being thus
  shattered—Durdhara abandoned it and fell to the ground, his life departed.
'29': >-
  Seeing him fallen upon the earth, Virūpākṣa and Yūpākṣa—both irresistible—were
  inflamed with rage and sprang up, destroyers of foes.
'30': >-
  Hanumān leapt up swiftly, poised in the clear sky. The strong-armed Vānara was
  struck upon the chest by those two with their maces.
'31': >-
  Breaking the force of the forceful pair, that mighty one fell again to the
  ground, swift as Garuḍa in his flight.
'32': >-
  Approaching a sāla tree and tearing it up, the son of the Wind slew those two
  heroic rākṣasas.
'33': >-
  Then, knowing that those three had been slain by the swift and powerful
  Vānara, the mighty Praghasa rushed forward at great speed, laughing aloud.
'34': >-
  And Bhāsakarṇa too, enraged, seized a spear; both of them, full of valor,
  stood on one side facing the tiger among monkeys, the illustrious one.
'35': >-
  Praghasa struck the vānara with a sharp-pointed battle-axe (paṭṭiśa), and
  Bhāsakarṇa, that rākṣasa, struck the elephant among monkeys with the spear.
'36': >-
  With his limbs wounded by them, and his body-hair smeared with blood, the
  Vānara became wrathful, his radiance like that of the rising sun.
'37': >-
  Tearing up a mountain peak—bearing beasts, serpents, and trees—Hanumān, that
  heroic elephant among monkeys, struck down the two rākṣasas. Crushed beneath
  the mountain-peak, they became like sesame seeds ground to powder.
'38': >-
  Then, when those five commanders had thus been laid low, the Vānara destroyed
  the remaining force.
'39': >-
  With horses he destroyed horses; with elephants, elephants; with warriors,
  warriors; with chariots, chariots—like the thousand-eyed Indra destroying the
  asuras.
'40': >-
  With horses, elephants, steeds, and great chariots whose axles were broken,
  and with rākṣasas slain, the earth became blocked all around, the ways
  obstructed everywhere.
'41': >-
  Thus, having slain in battle those leaders of the army—heroes together with
  their forces and their mounts—the hero still held the gateway-tower, appearing
  like Time itself, fully prepared, at the destruction of creatures.
'42': >-
  Thus ends the forty-sixth canto of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the foremost epic, entitled “The Slaying of the
  Five Commanders of the Army.”
