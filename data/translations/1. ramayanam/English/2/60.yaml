  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the sixtieth
  sarga, called “The Consolation of Kausalyā.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon Kausalyā, trembling again and again as though seized by a spirit,
  and as if her very life had sunk down into the earth, spoke to the charioteer.
'2': >-
  “Lead me to where that Kakutstha prince is—where Sītā is, and where Lakṣmaṇa
  is. For without them, even for a single moment, I truly have no strength to
  live here.”
'3': >-
  “Turn back the chariot at once; take me too to Daṇḍaka. Otherwise, if I do not
  follow after them, I shall go to Yama’s abode.”
'4': >-
  Her speech being choked and faltering, overwhelmed by the rush of tears, the
  charioteer, with palms joined, spoke these words to reassure the queen.
'5': >-
  “Cast away grief and delusion, and the agitation born of sorrow; brushing off
  this burning anguish, know that Rāghava will dwell in the forest.”
'6': >-
  “And Lakṣmaṇa also, serving at Rāma’s feet in the forest—righteous-souled,
  knower of dharma, his senses subdued—wins the worlds beyond.”
'7': >-
  “Even in the solitary forest, Sītā, having obtained a dwelling there as though
  in her own home, gains confidence without fear, her mind wholly reposed in
  Rāma.”
'8': >-
  “In her I perceive not even the slightest trace of dejection; Vaidehī appears
  to me as though she were well-suited to life in exile.”
'9': >-
  “Just as formerly, having gone to a garden of the city, she used to delight
  herself, so does Sītā delight herself even in lonely forests.”
'10': >-
  “Sītā, whose face resembles the young moon, sports like a child; devoted to
  Rāma, her spirit is not cast down, though she dwells in the secluded wood.”
'11': >-
  “For her heart has gone with him; on him her very life depends. Ayodhyā would
  be for her as the forest, if bereft of Rāma; and the forest would be for her
  as Ayodhyā.”
'12': >-
  “Vaidehī asks about the villages and the towns, and, seeing the course of the
  rivers, and the diverse kinds of trees as well, she inquires about them.”
'13': >-
  “By asking about Rāma, or about Lakṣmaṇa too, she understands—she who already
  understands—as though she were resting in a place of recreation only a krośa
  from Ayodhyā.”
'14': >-
  “This alone I remember—what she suddenly spoke. The words connected with
  Kaikeyī do not now appear in my mind.”
'15': >-
  Thus, having dispelled that statement which had arisen through heedlessness,
  the charioteer spoke to the queen soothing words, sweet to hear.
'16': >-
  “By the journey, by the force of the wind, by hurried commotion, and by the
  heat of the sun—Vaidehī’s radiance, like moonbeams, does not at all fade.”
'17': >-
  “Her face—like a lotus of a hundred petals, and shining like the full
  moon—does not tremble; such is the countenance of generous Vaidehī.”
'18': >-
  “Even today her feet, devoid of the red dye of lac, still shine like closed
  lotus-buds.”
'19': >-
  “With anklets sounding as though in playful sport, the lovely lady moves along
  in graceful play; even now Vaidehī, having laid aside her ornaments, is
  adorned only with that loveliness.”
'20': >-
  “Seeing an elephant, or a lion, or a tiger while dwelling in the forest, she
  does not admit fear, resting upon the arms of Rāma.”
'21': >-
  “Neither you are to be lamented, nor your own self; nor is the lord of men to
  be lamented. For this conduct will become an everlasting renown in the world.”
'22': >-
  Shaking off grief, their minds made glad, well-established on the path trodden
  by the great seers, delighting in the forest and eating wild fruits, they—true
  to the father’s auspicious promise—keep that vow.
'23': >-
  Yet, though restrained by the charioteer, whose words were well-spoken and
  fitting, the queen—wasted by sorrow for her son—did not cease from her
  lamenting cry, calling out, “Beloved!” and “Son!” and “Rāghava!”
'24': >-
  Thus ends the sixtieth sarga in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Consolation of Kausalyā.”
