  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the seventh canto,
  called “The Counsel Spoken by the Minister.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by the lord of rākṣasas, those mighty rākṣasas all, with joined
  palms, spoke to Rāvaṇa, the sovereign of rākṣasas.
'2': >-
  Not discerning the strength of the hostile side, and being without policy and
  lacking good sense, (you) O King—(though) armed with iron clubs, spears,
  javelins, tridents, and sharp swords—(why should you grieve)?
'3': >-
  Why does your exceedingly great army fall into despondency? You, having gone
  to Bhogavatī, overcame in battle the nāgas.
'4': >-
  The lord of wealth (Kubera), dwelling on the peak of Kailāsa and surrounded by
  many yakṣas—having wrought a very great slaughter, you brought him under your
  control.
'5': >-
  That mighty Lokapāla, proud of his friendship with Maheśvara—him you, O
  powerful one, conquered in battle through wrath.
'6': >-
  Having struck down hosts of yakṣas, and after troubling and subduing them, you
  brought away this aerial chariot from the peak of Kailāsa.
'7': >-
  Mayā, the lord of dānavas—through fear of you and wishing for friendship—gave
  his daughter to you for the sake of being your wife, O foremost of rākṣasas.
'8': >-
  That dānava-lord, O great-armed one, puffed up with prowess and hard to
  assail—after fighting, you brought him under your power; and Kumbhīnasī became
  a bringer of happiness (to you).
'9': >-
  The nāgas were conquered by you, O great-armed one, after you went to
  Rasātala—Vāsuki, Takṣaka, Śaṅkha, and Jatī were brought under your control.
'10': >-
  The dānavas too—imperishable, strong, heroic, and possessed of boons—after you
  fought for a whole year, were conquered by you in battle, O mighty lord.
'11': >-
  Relying on your own strength, you brought them under your sway, O subduer of
  foes; and there, O lord of rākṣasas, many māyās (magical powers and arts) were
  also obtained.
'12': >-
  The sons of Varuṇa as well—heroic, strong, and attended by the fourfold
  forces—were conquered by you in war, O highly fortunate one.
'13': >-
  (You entered) that great grasp of Death’s rod, adorned with śālmali trees;
  that mighty surge of Kāla’s noose; that serpent of Yama’s attendants.
'14': >-
  Plunging into that great ocean of Yama’s realm—hard to assail, by reason of
  its terrible fever—you, O King, crossed into Yama’s sea of strength.
'15': >-
  There, vast victory was won, and Death was turned back; and by your noble
  combat all the worlds there were thoroughly delighted.
'16': >-
  The earth was filled with many heroic kṣatriyas, equal to Śakra (Indra) in
  prowess—like (a forest) filled with great trees.
'17': >-
  In valor, excellence, and energy, Rāghava has no equal in battle; those
  warriors, difficult to conquer in war, were forcibly slain by you, O King.
'18': >-
  Therefore stand firm—why, O great king, should you weary yourself regarding
  the vānaras? Indrajit alone, the great-armed, will destroy them.
'19': >-
  And by him, O great king, after worshipping Maheśvara by an unsurpassed
  sacrifice, a boon has been obtained—exceedingly hard to attain in the world.
'20': >-
  (He will overwhelm them like) an ocean strewn with spear and javelin as its
  fishes, with scattered entrails as its seaweed, crowded with elephants and
  tortoises, and teeming with horses and frogs.
'21': >-
  (Like an ocean) with Rudra and Āditya as great crocodiles, the Maruts and
  Vasus as mighty serpents; with the floods of chariots, horses, and elephants
  as its waters; and with massed foot-soldiers as its broad sandbanks.
'22': >-
  For he, indeed, having encountered the ocean of strength of the gods, seized
  the lord of the gods (Indra) and even brought him into Laṅkā.
'23': >-
  And by the command of Pitāmaha (Brahmā), Śambara-slayer and Vṛtra-slayer
  (Indra) was released, and went to Svarga, O King, worshipped by all the gods.
'24': >-
  Therefore, O great king, send forth that very Indrajit, your son, until he
  leads that vānar host, together with Rāma, to destruction.
'25': >-
  O King, this calamity has come from common men; it should not be taken to
  heart by you— you shall slay Rāghava.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the seventh canto, called “The Counsel Spoken by the Minister,” in
  the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
