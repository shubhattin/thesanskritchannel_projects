  Now begins the twenty-first canto in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Rousing of Khara (to battle).”
'1': >-
  But Khara, again seeing Śūrpaṇakhā fallen (on the ground), spoke to her in
  anger, in clear words—she who had come seeking a disastrous end.
'2': >-
  “Just now, for your sake, those heroic Rākṣasas—flesh-eaters—have been
  dispatched by me. Why then are you weeping again?”
'3': >-
  “They are devoted, attached, and ever well-wishers of mine. When they are
  being slain, they would not be slain; nor would they fail to carry out my
  command.”
'4': >-
  “This is what I wish to hear—what is the cause on account of which, again
  crying ‘Alas, my lord!’ you wail and writhe upon the earth like a serpent?”
'5': >-
  “Why do you lament like one without a protector when I, your lord, am present?
  Rise, rise! Do not be thus—let this helpless faintheartedness be cast away.”
'6': >-
  Thus addressed, and consoled by Khara—the unconquerable—she wiped her
  tear-filled eyes and spoke to Khara, her brother.
'7': >-
  “Now have I come, my nose and ears cut off, drenched with streams of blood—yet
  comforted by you.”
'8': >-
  “And those fourteen heroic Rākṣasas were sent forth by you to slay Rāghava,
  the dreadful one, together with Lakṣmaṇa, for my pleasure.”
'9': >-
  “But all of them, enraged against Rāma, bearing spears and battle-axes in
  their hands, were slain in battle by arrows that pierced the vital parts.”
'10': >-
  “Seeing them, men of great speed, fallen upon the ground in a single moment,
  and beholding the mighty deed of Rāma, a great terror arose in me.”
'11': >-
  “I am afraid, agitated, and cast down, O ranger of the night; I have come to
  you again for refuge—seeing fear on every side.”
'12': >-
  “In this vast ocean of sorrow, whose waves are terror and whose waters are
  darkened by despair and anger, why do you not save me who am sinking?”
'13': >-
  “These too have been slain upon the earth by Rāma with sharp arrows—those
  Rākṣasas, flesh-eaters, who had come upon my path (to aid me).”
'14': >-
  “If you have compassion for me, and if you have compassion also for those
  Rākṣasas; if you have power against Rāma; if energy is in you, O
  night-ranger—”
'15': >-
  “Slay that thorn to the Rākṣasas, dwelling in the Daṇḍaka forest. If today you
  will not kill Rāma, the slayer of foes—”
'16': >-
  “Then, without shame, I shall give up my life right here before you. For I
  perceive with my understanding that you are not able, in battle,”
'17': >-
  “Even with your forces, to stand face to face (against him) in a great fight.
  Boastful of valor, you are not a hero—your prowess is falsely assumed.”
'18': >-
  “Go away quickly from Jana-sthāna together with your kinsmen. Slay the deluded
  (enemies) in battle—or else, O disgrace of your lineage,”
'19': >-
  “Since you cannot slay those two human beings, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, what sort of
  dwelling is this for you here—one who is without true substance and of little
  strength?”
'20': >-
  “Overpowered by the splendor of Rāma, you will swiftly perish. For Rāma, the
  son of Daśaratha, is endowed with that radiance.”
'21': >-
  “And his brother too is of great heroism—by whom I have been disfigured.” Thus
  lamenting again and again, that ogress with a torn belly bewailed.
'22': >-
  Near her brother, afflicted with grief, she fell senseless; striking her belly
  with both hands, she wept, exceedingly miserable.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-first canto in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, entitled “The Rousing of Khara (to battle).”
