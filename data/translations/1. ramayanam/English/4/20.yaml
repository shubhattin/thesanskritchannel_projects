'0': >-
  Then, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the twentieth
  canto, named “Tārā’s Lament.”
'1': >-
  Beholding him—smitten down upon the ground by the arrow released from Rāma’s
  bow, an arrow that brought death—Tārā, moon-faced like the lord of stars, saw
  her lord lying slain.
'2': >-
  That beautiful lady approached her husband and clasped him in her arms, when
  she saw Vāli—like a mighty elephant—struck by the shaft.
'3': >-
  With her mind scorched by grief, Tārā, distressed and bewildered, wailed over
  that foremost of monkeys, mountain-like in splendour, uprooted like a tree.
'4': >-
  “O hero of dreadful valour in battle, O mighty champion, O best among those
  that leap—why do you not speak to me now, you who were ever in front?
'5': >-
  Rise, O tiger among monkeys; take to a nobler couch. For princes of the
  highest order do not lie thus upon the bare earth.
'6': >-
  Truly, this earth is exceedingly dear to you, O lord of the earth; even though
  your life has departed, you still embrace her with your limbs, abandoning me,
  and resort to her!
'7': >-
  Surely today by your conduct, O hero, it is made plain that this fair city
  Kiṣkindhā has been fashioned, as it were, upon the path that leads to heaven,
  in accordance with righteousness.
'8': >-
  All those times when, together with me, you sported in forests fragrant with
  honey—by you, in this hour, an end has been put to them.
'9': >-
  Joyless and without hope am I, sunk in an ocean of sorrow, now that you—O
  great lord of monkey-troops, leader among leaders—have attained the state of
  the five elements (have died).
'10': >-
  How is it that my heart remains whole, when I behold you fallen on the
  earth—my heart which, not scorched by grief, does not this day burst asunder
  into a thousand pieces?
'11': >-
  Sugrīva’s wife was taken away by you, and he was driven into exile; that very
  consequence has now come upon you, O lord of monkeys—this is the repayment of
  that deed.
'12': >-
  Deluded, set upon what you thought to be your own welfare, you reproached me
  too—me who spoke words that were beneficial, seeking your good, O king of
  monkeys.
'13': >-
  O bestower of honour, proud of form and youth, and generous—surely, noble one,
  you will now agitate the hearts of the apsarās (celestial nymphs).
'14': >-
  Time indeed, beyond doubt, has become the ender of your life—by whose force
  you have fallen under the power, against your will, of Sugrīva.
'15': >-
  Having slain Vāli unfairly—while he was engaged in combat with another—does
  not Kakutstha (Rāma) feel anguish, after doing a deed so greatly censured?
'16': >-
  I, poor and wretched, will live on in widowhood, in the burning torment of
  grief—though formerly I was reared in comfort, untouched by sorrow—now like
  one without a protector.
'17': >-
  And brave Aṅgada—cherished and caressed, delicate, accustomed to ease—how
  shall he endure my condition, when his paternal uncle is possessed by wrath?
'18': >-
  Make your son one who has seen his father, O child—(a father) fair to behold
  and devoted to righteousness. For, dear one, rare indeed will your father’s
  sight be for you hereafter.
'19': >-
  Console your son, and convey for me a message; and having kissed him upon the
  head, you are departing on a journey of exile.
'20': >-
  For by Rāma a great deed has been done in slaying you; and he has discharged
  his debt in regard to Sugrīva’s pledge (the promise made to Sugrīva).
'21': >-
  “Be your desire fulfilled, O Sugrīva; you shall regain Rumā. Enjoy the kingdom
  without anxiety; your brother—so worthy—has been your foe.”
'22': >-
  Why do you not answer me, as I speak thus in lamentation—me who am dear to
  you? Behold these excellent arms of yours, O lord of monkeys—(once the embrace
  of) your wife!
'23': >-
  Hearing her lament, all those she-monkeys, gathering from every side,
  sorrowful and afflicted with grief, took hold of Aṅgada and cried aloud in
  response.
'24': >-
  “Leaving Aṅgada—O mighty-armed hero with Aṅgada—have you gone away on a long
  exile? It is not right thus to abandon your son, so near to you in virtue,
  dear, and adorned with pleasing beauty.”
'25': >-
  “If, without due thought, I have done anything in any way displeasing to you,
  O long-armed one—forgive me for that, O lord of the monkey-line. I bow my head
  to your feet, O hero, and depart.”
'26': >-
  Thus Tārā, weeping piteously—faultless in complexion—together with the
  she-monkeys, resolved to fast unto death, and sat down upon the ground close
  to her husband, where Vāli lay.
'27': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa—Ādi-kāvya—within the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the
  twentieth canto, called “Tārā’s Lament.”
