  Now begins, in the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-eleventh canto, called “The Fruit of Hearing the Sacred
  Rāmāyaṇa.”
'1': >-
  So much is this sacred narrative, together with its sequel, revered even by
  Brahmā; it is renowned by the name “Rāmāyaṇa,” the foremost work composed by
  Vālmīki.
'2': >-
  Thereupon Viṣṇu became firmly established in His own heavenly realm, as in a
  splendid city—He by whom this entire universe is pervaded, the three worlds
  with all that is moving and unmoving.
'3': >-
  Therefore the gods, together with the Gandharvas, and the Siddhas and the
  supreme sages, ever hear with satisfaction in heaven this divine Rāmāyaṇa.
'4': >-
  This narrative is a bestower of long life, of good fortune, and a destroyer of
  sin. The wise man should cause the Rāmāyaṇa—equal to the Vedas—to be recited
  at śrāddha rites.
'5': >-
  He who is without a son obtains a son; he who is poor obtains wealth. And he
  who recites even a single verse of it is freed from all sins.
'6': >-
  Even if a man commits sins day after day, by reciting but one single śloka he
  is delivered from sin.
'7': >-
  To the reciter one should give garments, a cow, and gold; when the reciter is
  well pleased, all the deities become pleased.
'8': >-
  A man who recites this life-bestowing Rāmāyaṇa—this sacred narrative—becomes
  honoured in this world along with sons and grandsons, and after departing
  hence he is honoured there also.
'9': >-
  Even the lovely city of Ayodhyā, having remained desolate for many years, upon
  obtaining a bull-like king (a foremost ruler), will again become a place of
  habitation.
'10': >-
  This life-bestowing narrative, together with what is to come and with its
  sequel, was composed by the son of Pracetas (Vālmīki); and Brahmā too approved
  it.
'11': >-
  By the hearing alone of a single canto, a man gains the fruit of a thousand
  Aśvamedha sacrifices and ten thousand Vājapeya sacrifices.
'12': >-
  Prayāga and other sacred bathing-places; the Gaṅgā and other rivers likewise;
  Naimiṣa and other forests; and Kurukṣetra and the rest as well—these have as
  good as been visited in this world by him who has heard the Rāmāyaṇa.
'13': >-
  He who gives, when the sun has been eclipsed, a burden of gold at Kurukṣetra,
  and he who in this world listens to the Rāmāyaṇa—both are equal in merit.
'14': >-
  He who, endowed with proper faith, listens to the Rāghava tale, is freed from
  all sin and goes to the realm of Viṣṇu.
'15': >-
  This primeval poem, this seer-born (ārṣa) work, was composed long ago by
  Vālmīki. He who always listens to it with devotion attains the divine,
  Vaiṣṇava state of being.
'16': >-
  Sons and wives prosper, wealth increases, and lineage continues; knowing this
  to be true, men of disciplined mind should surely listen to it.
'17': That unsurpassed Rāmāyaṇa is the very form of the Gāyatrī (mantra).
'18': >-
  He who is without a son obtains a son; he who is poor obtains wealth. And he
  who recites even a single verse of it is freed from all sins.
'19': >-
  He who recites or hears daily the deeds of Rāghava, becoming sinless through
  devotion, obtains long life.
'20': >-
  He who desires to attain the highest good should ever meditate upon Rāghava,
  and should cause this narrative to be recited to the Brāhmaṇas day after day.
'21': >-
  But he who reads in full this entire history of the Lord of the Raghu line—he
  surely goes to the imperishable realm of Viṣṇu; of this there is no doubt.
'22': >-
  His father, his grandfather, likewise his great-grandfather—his father’s
  father, and his father’s father as well—all go to Viṣṇu; there is no doubt.
'23': >-
  The deeds of Rāghava ever bestow the four aims of human life; therefore, with
  effort, it should always be listened to as the supreme (holy) recital.
'24': >-
  He who listens to the Rāmāyaṇa with devotion—even a quarter-verse or even a
  single word—goes to the abode of Brahmā and is ever honoured by Brahmā.
'25': >-
  Thus is this ancient, well-known narrative. May good be unto you. Proclaim it
  without fear; may the power of Viṣṇu increase.
'26': >-
  Thus ends, in the seer-born, glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki—the Ādikāvya—in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa, the one-hundred-and-eleventh canto, called “The Fruit of Hearing
  the Sacred Rāmāyaṇa.”
