  Then, in the holy, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins
  the forty‑ninth sarga, entitled “The Entry into Vālmīki’s Āśrama.”
'1': >-
  Beholding Sītā weeping there, the young sons of the sages ran swiftly to the
  place where the Blessed Vālmīki, the austere one of mighty splendour, was
  abiding.
'2': >-
  Having bowed down to the sage’s feet, the sages’ sons reported everything to
  the great seer—especially the sound of her sobbing and lamentation.
'3': >-
  “O Blessed One, never before has such a lady been seen by us—like Śrī herself
  as a consort of some great-souled one—yet, as if overwhelmed and bewildered,
  she wails, her face distorted with sorrow.”
'4': >-
  “O Blessed Sir, pray look—she is like a celestial maiden fallen from the sky.
  On the bank of the river, O venerable one, there is some excellent woman,
  deeply afflicted.”
'5': >-
  “We have seen her crying aloud, firmly given over to grief; undeserving of
  pain and sorrow, she is alone, wretched—like one without refuge.”
'6': >-
  “Indeed, we do not know her to be a human woman. Let due rites of hospitality
  be offered to her. Not far from the āśrama she has come to you for shelter.”
'7': >-
  “That virtuous lady seeks a protector; O Blessed One, you ought to protect
  her.” Hearing their words, and ascertaining the matter with his understanding,
  that knower of dharma—whose inner vision had been won by austerities—ran to
  the place where the Maithilī was.
'8': >-
  Perceiving him, that great-minded sage, setting out, his disciples too
  followed; and approaching that region, the great-minded one went forward a
  little on foot.
'9': >-
  Taking a fair arghya offering in hand, he came to the bank of the Jāhnavī
  (Gaṅgā). There he beheld Sītā, beloved of Rāghava, the wife—standing like one
  without protection.
'10': >-
  To that Sītā, oppressed beneath the heavy burden of grief, Vālmīki, foremost
  among sages, spoke words sweet and gentle, as though gladdening her by his
  very spiritual radiance.
'11': >-
  “You are the daughter-in-law of Daśaratha, the beloved chief queen of Rāma.
  Daughter of King Janaka, welcome to you, O faithful wife devoted to your
  husband.”
'12': >-
  “That you are coming has been known to me through my absorption in dharma; and
  the entire cause as well has been perceived by me in my heart.”
'13': >-
  “And, O most fortunate lady, your reality is known to me in truth; and to me
  is known all that occurs in the three worlds.”
'14': >-
  “Sītā, I know you to be free from sin through the sight obtained by austerity.
  Be at ease, O Vaidehī; at present you are under my care.”
'15': >-
  “Near my āśrama are women ascetics, established in penance. They will guard
  you always, O child, as a mother guards her calf.”
'16': >-
  “Receive this arghya, be confident, your fever of anguish gone; enter as
  though into your own home, and do not give way to dejection.”
'17': >-
  Hearing the sage’s supremely wondrous words, Sītā bowed her head to his feet
  and, with joined palms, replied, “So be it.”
'18': Then Sītā followed behind the departing sage, with palms joined in reverence.
'19': >-
  Seeing the sage approaching with Vaidehī, the wives of the sages came forward,
  filled with joy, and spoke these words:
'20': >-
  “Welcome to you, O best of sages; and welcome is your return after a long
  time. We all bow to you—tell us, what shall we do?”
'21': >-
  Hearing their words, Vālmīki said this: “This is Sītā, who has come here—the
  wife of wise Rāma.”
'22': >-
  “She is the daughter-in-law of Daśaratha, the virtuous daughter of
  Janaka—sinless, yet abandoned by her husband. She must ever be protected by
  me.”
'23': >-
  “Let you ladies look upon her with the highest affection; and out of respect
  for me and in obedience to my word, let her be especially honoured by you.”
'24': >-
  Again and again looking back at Vaidehī, the illustrious great
  ascetic—surrounded by his disciples—returned to his own āśrama.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the forty‑ninth sarga of the Uttarakāṇḍa in the sacred, illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Entry into Vālmīki’s Āśrama.”
