'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (the Paramātman).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': >-
  Now, the thirteenth chapter: The Yoga of Discerning the Distinction between
  the Field (kṣetra) and the Knower of the Field (kṣetrajña).
'3': 'Arjuna said:'
'4': >-
  Prakṛti (material nature) and Puruṣa (the conscious principle), and also the
  field and the knower of the field—this I desire to know, O Keśava; and also
  knowledge, and that which is to be known.
'5': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'6': >-
  This body, O son of Kuntī, is called the field; and he who knows this, the
  wise who know the truth call him the knower of the field.
'7': >-
  And know Me also, O Bhārata, to be the knower of the field in all fields. That
  knowledge which is of the field and the knower of the field—this is considered
  by Me to be true knowledge.
'8': >-
  What that field is, and of what nature it is; what its modifications are, and
  from what it arises; and who he is, and what his power is—hear all this from
  Me in brief.
'9': >-
  It has been sung in many ways by the ṛṣis, separately in various Vedic metres;
  and also in the well-reasoned and decisive aphorisms of the Brahma-sūtras.
'10': >-
  The great elements, egoism, intellect, and also the unmanifest; the ten senses
  and the one (mind); and the five objects of the senses—
'11': >-
  Desire and aversion, pleasure and pain, the aggregate (the body),
  consciousness, and fortitude—this, in brief, is declared to be the field,
  together with its modifications.
'12': >-
  Humility, unpretentiousness, non-injury, forbearance, uprightness; service to
  the teacher, purity, steadfastness, self-control—
'13': >-
  Dispassion toward the objects of the senses, and also absence of egoism;
  perception of the evil (the painful defect) in birth, death, old age, and
  disease—
'14': >-
  Non-attachment, and absence of clinging to son, wife, home, and the like; and
  constant evenness of mind in the attainment of the desirable and the
  undesirable—
'15': >-
  And unwavering devotion to Me by exclusive yoga (one-pointedness), and
  resorting to solitary places, and distaste for the company of people—
'16': >-
  Constancy in the knowledge of the Self, and the vision directed to the meaning
  of the knowledge of Reality (tattva)—this is said to be knowledge; what is
  other than this is ignorance.
'17': >-
  That which is to be known I shall declare, knowing which one attains
  immortality: the beginningless supreme Brahman, which is said to be neither
  being (sat) nor non-being (asat).
'18': >-
  With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads, and mouths everywhere; with
  ears everywhere in the world—That stands pervading all, enveloping everything.
'19': >-
  Shining as though endowed with the qualities of all the senses, yet devoid of
  all the senses; unattached, and yet the supporter of all; without qualities
  (nirguṇa), and yet the enjoyer of qualities (guṇa)—
'20': >-
  Outside and inside all beings; unmoving and also moving; and because of Its
  subtlety, That is unknowable; That is far, and That is also near.
'21': >-
  And undivided among beings, yet It appears as if divided; That is to be known
  as the sustainer of beings, and also as That which devours and That which
  brings forth.
'22': >-
  That is the Light even of lights; It is said to be beyond darkness. It is
  knowledge, the object of knowledge, and attainable through knowledge; It is
  seated in the heart of all.
'23': >-
  Thus the field, and also knowledge, and the object of knowledge have been
  stated briefly. My devotee, having understood this, becomes fit to attain My
  state of being.
'24': >-
  Know Prakṛti and Puruṣa both to be beginningless; and know also that the
  modifications and the guṇas arise from Prakṛti.
'25': >-
  Prakṛti is said to be the cause with regard to the agency of cause and effect
  in all actions; Puruṣa is said to be the cause with regard to the experience
  of pleasure and pain, as the enjoyer.
'26': >-
  For the Puruṣa, abiding in Prakṛti, experiences the guṇas born of Prakṛti.
  Attachment to the guṇas is the cause of his birth in good and evil wombs.
'27': >-
  In this body, the Supreme Puruṣa is also called the Witness, the Consenter,
  the Supporter, the Enjoyer, the Great Lord, and the Supreme Self (Paramātman).
'28': >-
  He who thus knows Puruṣa and Prakṛti together with the guṇas—though he may be
  acting in every way, he is not born again.
'29': >-
  Some behold the Self in the self by the self through meditation; others by the
  yoga of Sāṅkhya (discriminative knowledge); and others by the yoga of action.
'30': >-
  Others indeed, not knowing thus, worship, having heard from others; they too,
  being devoted to what they have heard, surely cross beyond death.
'31': >-
  Whatever being is born—whether unmoving or moving—know it, O bull among the
  Bharatas, to arise from the union of the field and the knower of the field.
'32': >-
  He who sees the Supreme Lord abiding equally in all beings—the imperishable
  within the perishing—he truly sees.
'33': >-
  For seeing the Lord equally present everywhere, he does not injure the Self by
  the self; therefore he goes to the supreme goal.
'34': >-
  He who sees that all actions are in every way performed by Prakṛti alone, and
  likewise sees the Self as non-doer—he truly sees.
'35': >-
  When he perceives the diverse states of beings as resting in the One, and
  their expansion as proceeding from That alone—then he attains Brahman.
'36': >-
  Because this Supreme Self is beginningless and without qualities, and
  imperishable, O son of Kuntī—though abiding in the body, It neither acts nor
  is tainted.
'37': >-
  As the all-pervading space, because of its subtlety, is not tainted, so the
  Self, abiding everywhere in the body, is not tainted.
'38': >-
  As the one sun illumines this entire world, so the knower of the field
  illumines the whole field, O Bhārata.
'39': >-
  Those who, with the eye of knowledge, thus know the distinction between the
  field and the knower of the field, and also the liberation from the Prakṛti of
  beings—they go to the Supreme.
'40': >-
  Om Tat Sat—thus in the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, among the Upaniṣads, in the
  science of Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
  Arjuna, ends the thirteenth chapter, entitled “The Yoga of the Discerning of
  the Field and the Knower of the Field.”
