  Now begins the sixty-third chapter, named “Sugrīva’s Joy,” in the
  Sundara-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Thereupon the bull among monkeys, seeing that monkey fallen at his feet with
  his head bowed down, became anxious at heart and spoke these words.
'2': >-
  “Rise, rise! Why have you fallen at my feet? I shall grant you fearlessness;
  let the truth alone be spoken.”
'3': >-
  “Tell me fully what has happened—what is fit for you to speak. Is all well in
  Madhuvana? I desire to hear, O monkey.”
'4': >-
  Thus reassured by that great-souled Sugrīva, Dadhimukha, a most wise monkey,
  rose up and spoke these words.
'5': >-
  “O King, this forest was never before given over (to be freely used) either by
  Vṛkṣarajas, nor by you, nor by Vāli. Yet that forest has indeed been laid
  waste by monkeys.”
'6': >-
  “I tried to restrain them all, together with these other forest-dwellers; but,
  paying no heed to me, they, delighted, keep eating and drinking.”
'7': >-
  “Even when the guardians of the forest tried to stop them and prevent this
  outrage, those forest-ranging monkeys, O lord, disregarding me as well,
  continue to eat.”
'8': >-
  “Some fling away what remains; others go on eating. All of them, though being
  restrained, merely show knitted brows in defiance.”
'9': >-
  “Then those enraged monkey-leaders, being further provoked by the (forest)
  guardians, became still more furious; and they could not be kept back from
  that forest.”
'10': >-
  “Thereafter many heroic monkeys, their eyes reddened with anger, violently
  assaulted the warders (the guardians of Madhuvana).”
'11': >-
  “Some were struck down with hands; some were hit with knees; some were hurled
  away at will, and were shown the ‘path of the gods’ (sent to death).”
'12': >-
  “Thus have these brave guardians been slain while you remain as our lord; and
  the whole of Madhuvana is being eaten at their pleasure.”
'13': >-
  While Sugrīva, the bull among monkeys, was thus being informed, Lakṣmaṇa—most
  wise and a slayer of hostile heroes—questioned him.
'14': >-
  “O King, who is this monkey, the keeper of the forest, who has come before
  you? And for what reason, indicating what matter, does he speak in distress?”
'15': >-
  Thus addressed by great-souled Lakṣmaṇa, Sugrīva, skilled in speech, replied
  to Lakṣmaṇa with these words:
'16': >-
  “Noble Lakṣmaṇa, this heroic monkey is Dadhimukha. By the valiant monkeys
  headed by Aṅgada, the honey has been consumed.”
'17': >-
  “Such a transgression would not occur in those whose task is unaccomplished.
  Since they have entered that forest, their mission has surely been achieved.”
'18': >-
  “The warders who tried hard to restrain them have been struck with knees; and
  this strong monkey Dadhimukha has not been heeded at all.”
'19': >-
  “This one is the lord of my forest, appointed by us ourselves. The Goddess
  (Sītā) has been seen—there is no doubt—and by none other than Hanūmān.”
'20': >-
  “For Hanūmān’s deed there is no other cause of success: accomplishment of the
  task rests in Hanūmān—his very resolve is that of the foremost of monkeys.”
'21': >-
  “His determination and valor are well established, and his learning too is
  renowned—where Jāmbavān is the leader, and Aṅgada is of great strength,”},{
'22': >-
  “and where Hanūmān himself is the chief agent, there can be no other outcome.
  Indeed, the Madhuvana has, as it is said, been destroyed by the heroes headed
  by Aṅgada.”
'23': >-
  “Having searched the southern quarter, the foremost of monkeys returned; and
  by them that Madhuvana—so difficult to assail—has indeed been ravaged.”
'24': >-
  “The entire forest has been violated and used up by the monkeys; and the
  forest-guards were felled then, struck with knees.”
'25': >-
  “For this very reason has this one come here to report—this sweet-voiced
  monkey named Dadhimukha, famed for prowess.”
'26': >-
  “Sītā has been seen, O mighty-armed son of Sumitrā—see the truth of it: that
  is why all the monkeys, having come back, are drinking honey.”
'27': >-
  “For without seeing the princess of Videha, O best of men—those
  forest-dwellers, famed as they are, would not dare to violate that divine
  forest, granted as a boon.”
'28': >-
  Then righteous Lakṣmaṇa, together with Rāghava, was filled with delight,
  hearing that voice—pleasing to the ear—issuing from Sugrīva’s mouth.
'29': >-
  Rāma rejoiced exceedingly, and Lakṣmaṇa of great renown also; and Sugrīva too,
  hearing thus from Dadhimukha, became delighted.
'30': >-
  Again Sugrīva spoke to the forest-guardian: “I am pleased that the forest has
  been eaten by those who have accomplished their work.”
'31': >-
  “The violation and the conduct of those who have fulfilled their task are to
  be borne. Go quickly—guard Madhuvana yourself; and promptly send all those
  monkeys, with Hanūmān at their head.”
'32': >-
  “I desire quickly—together with the two Rāghavas—to question those
  monkey-warriors, headed by Hanūmān, proud as lordly lions, now successful in
  their purpose; and to hear of their effort in the discovery of Sītā.”
'33': >-
  Seeing the two princes, their eyes brimming with joy and themselves exultant;
  and seeing the king of monkeys also with his purpose fulfilled—knowing the
  success of the enterprise, with his whole body thrilled with delight, he
  rejoiced exceedingly, embracing them with his arms.
'34': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-third chapter, named “Sugrīva’s Joy,” in the Sundara-kāṇḍa
  of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
