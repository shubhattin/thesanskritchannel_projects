  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  seventy-first sarga, called “The Return to Ayodhyā.”
'1': >-
  That valiant one, facing eastward, set forth from the royal residence; and
  then, beholding the radiant river Sudāmā, he crossed over it.
'2': >-
  That illustrious scion of Ikṣvāku crossed the river Śatadrū—gladdening, with
  its far shore at a distance, flowing with a current running westward, and full
  of waves.
'3': >-
  Having forded the river Eladhānā, and reaching the further Pārpaṭas, he
  crossed also Śilākuṛvatī, and (then) Āgneyam, named Śalyakartanam (the “cutter
  of spears/shafts”).
'4': >-
  Faithful to truth and pure, the illustrious prince, looking upon Śilāvahā (the
  “stone-bearing” stream), passed beyond the great mountains and advanced
  towards the forest named Caitraratha.
'5': >-
  And having approached the Sarasvatī and the Gaṅgā by the same course, he
  entered northward into the forest called Bhāruṇḍa, in the region of the
  Vīramatsyas.
'6': >-
  Reaching the Yamunā—swift-flowing—and (having passed) the river called
  Kuliṅgā, a delight-giving stream surrounded by mountains, he crossed over and
  then gave rest to his forces.
'7': >-
  Cooling their limbs and refreshing the weary steeds, he bathed there and
  drank, and then set out again, taking water with him.
'8': >-
  The prince, traversing a great wilderness not continually frequented (by men),
  passed on in his auspicious chariot, like the wind speeding through the sky.
'9': >-
  Rāghava swiftly approached the Bhāgīrathī—hard to cross, mighty, and pure—(and
  came) to the renowned town called Prāgvaṭa.
'10': >-
  Crossing the Gaṅgā at Prāgvaṭa, he reached Kuṭikoṣṭhikā; and, along with his
  army, having crossed there, he came to Dharmavardhana.
'11': >-
  By the southern half of (that) gateway, Daśaratha’s son reached Jambūprastha;
  and he also went on to the delightful village called Varūtha.
'12': >-
  Having sojourned in that lovely forest, he proceeded eastward, to the grove of
  Ujjihānā, where there were beloved Priyaka trees.
'13': >-
  Reaching those Priyaka trees, he quickly set the horses in motion; and then,
  having taken leave of the army, Bharata went on in haste.
'14': >-
  Having stayed at every sacred ford, and having crossed the river Uttānakā, and
  also other diverse rivers—mountain-born and swift-flowing—(he pressed onward).
'15': >-
  Having reached Hastipṛṣṭhaka, he passed beyond Kuṭikā; and that tiger among
  men crossed the Lohitya and also the Kapīvatī.
'16': >-
  In one day he crossed the rivers Sthāṇumatī and Vinatā and also the Gomati;
  and reaching Kāliṅga-nagara likewise, he then came to the Sāla forest.
'17': >-
  Bharata arrived quickly, his mounts exceedingly wearied; and having swiftly
  traversed the forest, he came (on) at dawn, when the ruddy sun arose.
'18': >-
  After spending seven nights on the road, that tiger among men beheld Ayodhyā,
  the city built by King Manu.
'19': >-
  Seeing Ayodhyā before him, he spoke to the charioteer in the chariot: “This
  renowned city, with its sacred groves, seems unfamiliar to me indeed.”
'20': >-
  “Ayodhyā is seen from afar, O charioteer—its pale earth (showing). (It is
  known for) Brāhmaṇas, performers of sacrifices, endowed with virtues, and
  perfected in the Vedas.”
'21': >-
  “Abundantly filled with sages, protected by excellent royal sages—formerly in
  Ayodhyā a great and tumultuous sound used to be heard.”
'22': >-
  “That sound, of men and women all around, I do not hear today. For in the
  evenings, when men would cease from work after sporting in the gardens,”
'23': >-
  “those gardens, which on other days would shine with people running about on
  all sides, today seem as though they are weeping—abandoned by
  pleasure-seekers.”
'24': >-
  “The city appears to me like a wilderness, O charioteer; for here neither
  vehicles are to be seen, nor elephants, nor horses.”
'25': >-
  “Neither do the foremost of men go out or come in as they did before. The
  gardens that formerly shone—intoxicated with delight—(now do not).”
'26': >-
  “Those places, once exceedingly rich in every excellence amidst the mingling
  and pleasures of the people—those very places I now behold, utterly joyless.”
'27': >-
  “With trees along the road having drooping leaves, as though crying out—still
  today the cries of intoxicated beasts and birds are not heard.”
'28': >-
  “(Formerly) with the sweet reddened (joyful) voices of many, speaking gently
  and melodiously, and with incomparable incense compounded of sandal and
  agaru,”
'29': >-
  “the auspicious breeze would blow. Why is it not so today as before? And
  again, (formerly) the sound of kettledrums, mṛdaṅgas, and vīṇās—struck and
  resonating in concert—(was heard).”
'30': >-
  “Why has the sound ceased today, though it was ever present before? And I
  behold various evil and sinful portents as well.”
'31': >-
  “Inauspicious and displeasing omens are seen; therefore your mind sinks. In
  every way, O sūta, well-being among my kinsmen seems hard to attain.”
'32': >-
  “Indeed, even without any confusion, my heart seems to sink. I am despondent,
  with a quieted heart, frightened, and with my senses unsettled.”
'33': >-
  Bharata swiftly entered the city protected by the Ikṣvākus; by the gate called
  Vaijayanta he entered, his vehicles worn with fatigue.
'34': >-
  Rising up, the gate-keepers asked him of victory, and along with them he went
  on. And he—having a heart burdened with many forebodings—honoured those men,
  returning their salutations.
'35': >-
  There Rāghava spoke to the charioteer of the lord of horses (his driver), who
  was weary: “For what reason, blameless one, have I been brought in such
  haste?”
'36': >-
  “My heart suspects evil, and my very disposition seems to sink. Such signs as
  we had heard of before at the destruction of kings—”
'37': >-
  “all those signs I see here, O charioteer. I perceive harshness and
  neglect—(things) lacking in due cleansing and order.”
'38': >-
  “Doors with bolts left unfastened, prosperity absent on all sides; offerings
  to the spirits and customary rites not performed; and likewise the perfuming
  with incense absent.”
'39': >-
  “I see householders’ dwellings—families not having eaten, people without their
  former radiance—homes marked by misfortune.”
'40': >-
  “The shrines of the gods, lacking the beauty of garlands, their courtyards
  uncleansed, stand empty; and they do not shine as before.”
'41': >-
  “Worship of the deities lies cast aside, and sacrificial halls are in that
  condition; in the garland-markets too, the goods do not shine today as they
  used to.”
'42': >-
  “Even the merchants are seen today not as before in this place—hearts
  distressed with anxious thought, their trade and enterprises ruined and
  constrained.”
'43': >-
  “And in the temples and caitya-shrines, the flocks of birds likewise appear
  wretched.”
'44': >-
  “I see the people in the city—men and women—with tear-filled eyes, unclean,
  miserable, intent on brooding, emaciated, and pining with longing.”
'45': >-
  Thus speaking, Bharata, with a sorrowful mind, beholding those inauspicious
  signs in Ayodhyā, went on to the royal palace.
'46': >-
  Seeing that city—its lofty mansions empty, its streets and houses deserted,
  its gateways and doors smeared with reddish dust—though it shone like the city
  of Indra, he became filled with yet greater sorrow.
'47': >-
  Beholding many things displeasing to the mind, which had never been in that
  city before, that noble one entered his father’s palace—head bowed, spirit
  cast down, and without joy.
'48': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-first sarga in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, entitled “The Return to Ayodhyā.”
