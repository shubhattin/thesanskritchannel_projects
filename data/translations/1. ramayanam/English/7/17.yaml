  Now begins the Seventeenth Canto in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Curse (and Vow) of Vedavatī.”
'1': >-
  Then, O King, the mighty-armed Rāvaṇa, ranging over the surface of the earth,
  came upon the forest of Himavān and wandered about there.
'2': >-
  There he beheld a maiden wearing a black antelope-skin, with matted locks,
  engaged according to the ordinance of the seers—radiant like a goddess,
  blazing with ascetic splendor.
'3': >-
  Seeing that maiden, endowed with beauty and observing a very great vow,
  Rāvaṇa—his mind overcome by desire and delusion—questioned her, as though with
  a smile.
'4': >-
  “What is this course you follow, O auspicious lady, which is contrary to your
  youth? For such conduct is not fitting in return for such beauty as yours.”
'5': >-
  “Your beauty is incomparable, O timid one—one that maddens men with desire. It
  is not proper for you to remain in austerity; such is the settled conclusion.”
'6': >-
  “Whose are you, O auspicious lady, and what is this (austerity)? And who is
  your husband, O fair-faced one? That man by whom you are enjoyed, O timid one,
  is indeed a most fortunate person upon the earth.”
'7': >-
  “As I ask, tell me everything: for what reason is this toil?” Thus addressed
  by Rāvaṇa, that illustrious maiden (prepared to answer).
'8': >-
  Having duly offered him hospitality, that ascetic maiden spoke: “Kuśadhvaja is
  my father, an immeasurably effulgent Brahmarṣi—glorious, the son of Bṛhaspati,
  and in intellect equal to Bṛhaspati.”
'9': >-
  “While that great-souled one was ever engaged in the constant practice of the
  Vedas, I was born from him as a maiden formed of sacred speech, and I am
  remembered by the name Vedavatī.”
'10': >-
  “Then the gods, together with Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, and Nāgas, went
  also to my father and approved of (sought) my hand in marriage.”
'11': >-
  “But my father did not give me to them, O bull among Rākṣasas. I shall tell
  the reason for that—O night-roaming one, listen.”
'12': >-
  “For my father’s son-in-law is indeed Viṣṇu, the Lord of the gods—the ruler of
  the three worlds—intended (by him); therefore my father wills me for none
  other.”
'13': >-
  “When he wished to give me to Him, hearing that, a king of the Daityas named
  Dambhu, intoxicated with strength, became wrathful.”
'14': “By that sinful one, my father, as he lay sleeping at night, was slain.”
'15': >-
  “Then my mother, afflicted with grief, embraced my father’s body, and that
  noble lady entered the sacrificial fire.”
'16': >-
  “Therefore, to make true my father’s desire toward Nārāyaṇa, I bear Him alone
  within my heart.”
'17': >-
  “Having thus taken up this vow, I practice abundant austerity. All this has
  been declared to you by me, O chief of Rākṣasas.”
'18': >-
  “Nārāyaṇa is my husband, and no other—apart from that Supreme Person. With the
  desire of attaining Nārāyaṇa I undertake a dreadful observance. You are known
  to me, O King—go, O son of Pulastya.”
'19': “By austerity I know everything that occurs in the three worlds.”
'20': >-
  Thereupon Rāvaṇa again spoke to that great-vowed maiden; descending from the
  forepart of his aerial car, afflicted by the arrows of Kandarpa (the god of
  love), he addressed her.
'21': >-
  “You are proud, O fair-hipped one, whose mind is of such a kind. In the eyes
  of the aged, O doe-eyed girl, the store of merit shines forth (in you).”
'22': >-
  “You are endowed with every virtue; you ought not to speak thus. O timid one,
  you are the beauty of the three worlds, yet your youth is passing away.”
'23': >-
  “I am the lord of Laṅkā, O auspicious lady, famed as Daśagrīva. Become my
  wife; enjoy pleasures at your ease, as you wish.”
'24': >-
  “And who, indeed, is that one whom you call Viṣṇu? In valor, in austerity, in
  enjoyment, and in strength, he is not equal to me, O auspicious lady—he whom
  you desire, O woman.”
'25': When he had spoken thus, Vedavatī then replied.
'26': >-
  That maiden said to him, the night-roaming one: “Do not speak to me in this
  manner—about enjoyment and strength. Viṣṇu, the overlord of the three worlds,
  is worshipped by all the worlds. Apart from you, O lord of Rākṣasas, what wise
  man would disdain (insult) Him?”
'27': >-
  Thus addressed by Vedavatī there, the night-ranger, with the tips of his
  fingers, touched her upon the hair of her head.
'28': >-
  Then Vedavatī, enraged, cut off her hair with her own hand; and her hand,
  becoming as it were a sword, made those locks severed.
'29': >-
  Blazing, as it were, with wrath—burning, as it were, the night-roamer—she
  spoke, kindling fire (for herself) and hastening, intent on death.
'30': >-
  “Dishonored by you, O ignoble one, I do not desire to live. Therefore, O
  Rākṣasa, I shall enter the blazing fire before your very eyes.”
'31': >-
  “Since I have been violated by you, a sinful-souled one, in the forest,
  therefore, for the sake of your slaying, I shall arise again (be born again).”
'32': >-
  “For it is not possible for a woman to kill a man, one fixed in sin. If I were
  to cast a curse upon you, there would be a wasting away of my austerity.”
'33': >-
  “If there is in me anything performed—given, offered into the fire, and the
  like—then, by that merit, may I be born from a womb as a virtuous woman, the
  daughter of a righteous man.”
'34': >-
  Having spoken thus, she entered the blazing Jātavedas (fire); and from the
  heavens a divine shower of flowers fell all around.
'35': >-
  Again she arose upon a lotus, having the radiance equal to a lotus, and again,
  just as before, she was reached (approached) by that Rākṣasa.
'36': >-
  Seizing that maiden, who looked like the interior of a lotus, he went to his
  own abode; and having taken her, Rāvaṇa showed her to his minister.
'37': >-
  That minister, a knower of marks (and omens), having examined her, said to
  Rāvaṇa: “This fair-hipped woman appears (destined) for your death—indeed, she
  is seen as the cause of your slaying.”
'38': >-
  Hearing this, O Rāma, Rāvaṇa cast her into the ocean. And she, reaching the
  earth, came to be in the midst of a sacrificial ground.
'39': >-
  Uprooted by the ploughshare of a king, she rose again, chaste. She is the
  daughter born to King Janaka, O Lord—your wife, O mighty-armed one; for you
  are the eternal Viṣṇu.
'40': >-
  “Formerly, with wrath as her cause, by whom that enemy was thus slain—having
  resorted to a mountain-slope—(so too now) by your superhuman valor.”
'41': >-
  “Thus shall this great-fortuned lady be born again among mortals, in a field
  furrowed by the ploughshare, upon the sacrificial altar, resembling a flame of
  fire.”
'42': >-
  “She was formerly named Vedavatī in the Kṛta Yuga; and having attained the
  Tretā Yuga, she was (born) for the sake of slaying that Rākṣasa.”
'43': >-
  “Born in the Maithila line, to the great-souled Janaka, she—Sītā—having sprung
  from the furrow, is again spoken of by men as ‘Sītā.’”
'44': >-
  Thus ends the Seventeenth Canto, entitled “The Curse (and Vow) of Vedavatī,”
  in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
