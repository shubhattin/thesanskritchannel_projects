  Now begins the sixty-third canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “Kumbhakarṇa’s Lament (and Counsel) to Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that lamentation of the king of the Rākṣasas, Kumbhakarṇa spoke these
  words, and even laughed aloud.
'2': >-
  The very fault that was seen by us long ago, at the time of deliberation in
  counsel—because you, though advised for your welfare, did not apply yourself
  to it—that same fault has now been brought upon you.
'3': >-
  Swift indeed has the fruit of sinful action come upon you—like the falling
  into hell itself that befalls one of evil deeds.
'4': >-
  In the first place, O great king, this undertaking was done without
  reflection; solely out of pride in prowess, the consequences and sequel were
  not considered.
'5': >-
  He who, having attained sovereignty, undertakes later what ought to have been
  done first, and does first what ought to have been done later—he understands
  neither right policy nor wrong policy.
'6': >-
  Acts done without due regard to place and time, and performed in a contrary
  manner, become vitiated—like oblations offered into fires by the unrestrained
  and unpurified.
'7': >-
  He who rightly applies the proper combination of the divisions of action, and
  having made a timely compact with his ministers, he indeed proceeds on the
  correct path.
'8': >-
  And that king who desires to act in accordance with the sacred tradition and
  in due season—he understands through the intelligence of his counsellors, and
  also keeps in view his well-wishers.
'9': >-
  Whether it be dharma, artha, or kāma—or all of them, O lord of the Rākṣasas—a
  man should pursue them according to the proper time; or again, he should weigh
  the pairs of opposites among the three.
'10': >-
  Among these three, if a king—or even one who is merely king in name—having
  heard what is best, does not comprehend it, then all his learning and hearing
  of scriptures is futile.
'11': >-
  Conciliation with gifts, soothing assurances, sowing dissension, and valour at
  the proper time—together with right application—these two are indeed the ways
  of policy and impolicy, O best of the Rākṣasas.
'12': >-
  He who, at the proper time, having deliberated with his ministers regarding
  dharma, artha, and kāma, conducts himself with self-mastery in the world—such
  a one does not fall into calamity.
'13': >-
  Having looked to what is wholesome and to the consequences, a king should
  undertake his affairs here, together with ministers who know the true
  principles of statecraft and live by their intellect.
'14': >-
  Men of beast-like understanding, not knowing the meaning of the treatises, and
  made inwardly part of the circle of ministers, wish from sheer presumption to
  speak out.
'15': >-
  For those who do not know the śāstras, their speech is not to be set forth as
  guidance in affairs—especially for those who are ignorant of arthaśāstra yet
  desire abundant prosperity.
'16': >-
  Those men who, out of impudence, speak what is harmful in the guise of what is
  beneficial—such persons, who spoil undertakings, must inevitably be kept
  outside counsel.
'17': >-
  Joining with wise enemies, and bringing ruin upon their lord, such ministers
  cause actions to be done here that are altogether perverse.
'18': >-
  In decisions of counsel, the lord should recognize by practical dealings those
  ministers who appear like friends yet are enemies—those who have insinuated
  themselves into service.
'19': >-
  As for one who is fickle here and rushes headlong in his undertakings, others
  find an opening—like birds finding the gap in the sky for the krauñca.
'20': >-
  For he who, despising the enemy, does not guard himself, indeed meets with
  misfortune, and is even cast down from his position.
'21': >-
  What was spoken to you earlier by my dear younger brother and by me—that alone
  is salutary counsel for us; do as you wish.
'22': >-
  But hearing Kumbhakarṇa’s words, Daśagrīva knitted his brows, and, enraged,
  spoke to him.
'23': >-
  “Are you to instruct me, as though you were a revered teacher and preceptor?
  Having thus exhausted your speech, let what is proper now be done.”
'24': >-
  “Whether through delusion, or through confusion of mind, or through reliance
  on strength and prowess—whatever has not been resolved until now, it is vain
  to speak of it again.”
'25': >-
  “But what is fitting at this time—let that be considered now. The past is not
  bewailed; what is gone is gone indeed.”
'26': >-
  “Set right, by valour, the fault that has arisen from me. If indeed there is
  affection for me in you, then exert yourself in heroism.”
'27': >-
  “If this matter of mine is to you the most important work in your heart—he is
  a true friend who stands by one whose purpose has failed and who has fallen
  into distress.”
'28': >-
  “He is a kinsman who, when one is deprived, comes forward to aid.” As he spoke
  thus—those firm and formidable words—
'29': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa, understanding, “He is angered,” and observing his brother’s
  senses to be greatly agitated, spoke gently and softly.
'30': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa then spoke these words slowly, consoling him: “Hear me, O king,
  with attention, O subduer of foes.
'31': >-
  Enough, O lord of the Rākṣasa kings—this grief befits you not. Casting aside
  wrath, you ought to become composed.
'32': >-
  This should not be held in your mind while I yet live, O sovereign. I shall
  destroy that because of which you are tormented.
'33': >-
  Yet what is beneficial must be spoken by me to you in every condition—spoken
  out of kinship, O king, and from a brother’s affection.
'34': >-
  And what, in this time, is fitting to be done by a loving kinsman—behold the
  slaughter of the enemies, to be wrought by me in battle.
'35': >-
  Today, behold, O mighty-armed one, on the forefront of battle: with Rāma slain
  together with his brother, the monkey host fleeing in rout.
'36': >-
  Today, when I have brought from the battlefield the head of Rāma for you to
  see, be happy, O mighty-armed one; let Sītā become sorrowful.
'37': >-
  Today let all the Rākṣasas in Laṅkā, whose kinsmen have been slain, behold the
  exceedingly dear and great death of Rāma.
'38': >-
  Today, for those overcome with grief, lamenting the slaughter of their own
  kin, I shall wipe away their tears by the destruction of the enemy in war.
'39': >-
  Today behold in battle Sugrīva, lord of the monkeys—torn apart and
  scattered—like a mountain-like cloud with the sun within it shattered asunder.
'40': >-
  How is it, O ever-blameless one, that you—though comforted by me and by these
  Rākṣasas eager to slay the son of Daśaratha—still remain distressed?
'41': >-
  “Rāghava will slay you after slaying me”—if such is your thought, O lord of
  the Rākṣasas, I would not admit such anguish in myself.
'42': >-
  Even now command me, O tormentor of foes; for you have no other to look to for
  battle, O you of incomparable prowess.
'43': >-
  I shall utterly destroy your mighty enemies—be he Indra, be he Yama, be they
  Fire and Wind.
'44': >-
  I shall fight even Kubera and Varuṇa— I whose body is as huge as a mountain,
  who bears the sharp spear.
'45': >-
  At my roaring, with my terrible fangs, even Purandara would be afraid—or else,
  even if I cast away weapons, while crushing foes with sheer speed and force.
'46': >-
  No one who wishes to live is able to stand facing me—not by strength, nor by
  mace, nor by sword, nor by sharp arrows.
'47': >-
  Grasping with my very hands, I shall slay even the wielder of the
  thunderbolt—if that Rāghava can today endure the force of my fists.
'48': >-
  Then my torrents of arrows shall drink the blood of Rāghava. Why do you burn
  with worry, O king, while I am here?
'49': >-
  I, prepared to march out for the destruction of the enemy for your sake, will
  cast off your dreadful fear of Rāma—I shall slay him in battle.
'50': >-
  Rāghava, and Lakṣmaṇa also, and mighty Sugrīva, and Hanumān the slayer of
  Rākṣasas by whom Laṅkā was set ablaze—
'51': >-
  and the monkeys too—I shall devour them when the battle is joined. I desire to
  bestow upon you extraordinary and great glory.
'52': >-
  If there is fear from Indra, O king, or even from the Self-born Brahmā—then I
  shall destroy that, as the radiant sun destroys the darkness of night.
'53': >-
  Even the gods would lie prostrate on the earth when I am enraged. I shall
  subdue Yama, and I shall devour Fire.
'54': >-
  I shall cast down the Sun, along with the stars, upon the earth; I shall slay
  Śatakratu (Indra); I shall drink up the ocean, the abode of Varuṇa.
'55': >-
  I shall pulverize mountains; I shall rend the earth asunder—behold the prowess
  of Kumbhakarṇa, long asleep.
'56': >-
  Today let beings everywhere behold themselves being devoured on all sides. Yet
  even this entire heaven of the gods will not suffice as my food.
'57': >-
  To gather for you the happiness that comes from the slaying of the son of
  Daśaratha, I set forth; having slain Rāma together with Lakṣmaṇa, I shall
  devour all the leaders of the monkey hosts.
'58': >-
  Take your delight, O king, and drink today the wine of Varuṇa; perform your
  royal duties, casting away sorrow. When today Rāma has been sent to Yama’s
  abode by me, before long Sītā will be wholly under your sway.”
'59': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-third canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “Kumbhakarṇa’s Lament (and Counsel).”
