  Now begins the sixty‑fourth sarga, named “The Account of Daśaratha (his past
  deed)”, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Rāghava, that righteous-souled one, lamenting over that killing which was
  wholly unworthy and improper in the case of that great ṛṣi, again spoke to
  Kausalyā.
'2': >-
  Then, having committed that great sin through ignorance, with his senses
  confounded, I, all alone, reflected in my mind: “How, indeed, can any merit
  arise from this?”
'3': >-
  Thereupon, taking up that water‑pot filled with excellent water, I reached
  that hermitage and went by the very path that had been pointed out to me.
'4': >-
  There I saw his two parents—feeble, blind, aged, without any guide—like two
  birds with their wings shorn.
'5': >-
  They sat there, occupied with causes and talk, unable to move about; bereft of
  hope because of me, indifferent and helpless like those without protectors.
'6': >-
  My heart was stricken with grief and my mind was shaken with fear; and having
  gone to that very spot of the hermitage, I fell again into sorrow.
'7': >-
  Hearing the sound of my footsteps, the sage spoke these words: “Why do you
  delay, my son? Bring the water quickly.”
'8': >-
  “For this reason, dear child, you have been sporting in the water—your mother
  here longs for you. Enter the hermitage quickly.”
'9': >-
  “If any fault has been committed, my son, either by your mother or by me, you
  should not place it in your heart, dear child, you who are an ascetic.”
'10': >-
  “You are the refuge of those without refuge; you are the eyes of the eyeless.
  Our very lives cling to you—why do you not speak even a little to us?”
'11': >-
  Seeing that sage, I, with faltering voice, indistinct in my utterance, and
  frightened like one truly afraid, spoke.
'12': >-
  Steadying the force of my speech with the movements and efforts of my mind, I
  explained to him the fearful calamity concerning his son.
'13': >-
  “I am a kṣatriya, Daśaratha; I am not the son of that great sage. This
  grief—despised by the good—has come upon me, born of my own deed.”
'14': >-
  “O Blessed One, having come to the bank of the Sarayū, I—intent on
  killing—aimed at some creature’s track, thinking perhaps to strike a śvapada
  (wild beast), or an elephant that had come to the watering-place.”
'15': >-
  “Then I heard a sound—the filling of a water‑jar in the water. Thinking, ‘This
  is an elephant,’ I struck with an arrow.”
'16': >-
  “Then, going to the riverbank, I saw an ascetic lying on the ground, his chest
  pierced by the arrow, his life-breath gone.”
'17': >-
  “O Blessed One, perceiving the sound, I—desiring to kill an elephant—released
  in the water a sharp arrow; by that, your son has been slain.”
'18': >-
  “Then, at his very word, I approached him as he burned with pain, and I
  quickly drew out the arrow from his vital spot.”
'19': >-
  “And, with the arrow removed, he then and there attained heaven, lamenting:
  ‘Alas, my two blind parents!’”
'20': >-
  “Through ignorance, your son was suddenly struck down by me. In this state of
  affairs, whatever should be done—be pleased to instruct me, O sage.”
'21': >-
  Hearing those cruel words, heaving deep sighs and wasted by grief, the blessed
  ṛṣi could scarcely endure the fierce anguish.
'22': >-
  That great and radiant one, his face filled with tears, sighing and worn by
  sorrow, spoke to me as I stood before him with joined palms.
'23': >-
  “Had you not yourself told me this inauspicious deed, O King, your head would
  have burst at once into a hundred thousand pieces by the fruit (of the act).”
'24': >-
  “The slaying by a kṣatriya, O King—especially of one who has taken to
  forest‑life (a vānaprastha)—if done knowingly, could even shake Indra from his
  station.”
'25': >-
  “A man’s head would split sevenfold if, with full knowledge, he were to cast a
  weapon at such a brahmacārin who abides in asceticism.”
'26': >-
  “But since this was done through ignorance, thereby you still live; otherwise,
  even today the very lineage of the Rāghavas would have perished—how much more
  you!”
'27': >-
  And he said to me, “Lead us, O king, to that place. Today we wish to see our
  son—this will be our last sight of him.”
'28': >-
  “His limbs stained with blood, his deerskin garments scattered, lying on the
  earth unconscious, gone under the sway of Yama, the lord of dharma.”
'29': >-
  Then I, all alone, led those two who were exceedingly afflicted to that place;
  and I made that sage and his wife touch their son.
'30': >-
  Touching their own son and reaching him, those two ascetics fell upon his
  body; and his father spoke these words:
'31': >-
  “Was I not dear to you, my son? Behold your mother, O righteous one. Why do
  you not embrace (us), my son? Speak a tender word.”
'32': >-
  “Was I not dear to you, my son? Behold your mother, O righteous one. Why do
  you not embrace (us), my son? Speak a tender word.”
'33': >-
  “Whose voice, heart‑delighting, shall I hear in the latter part of the
  night—reciting, especially, the sweet śāstras or some other lore?”
'34': >-
  “Who, having performed the twilight worship, having bathed, and having offered
  the oblations and taken food, will sit near and gladden me—stricken by the
  grief and fear born of my son?”
'35': >-
  “Who will bring bulbs, roots, and fruits and feed me—like a beloved guest—me
  who am helpless, without support, without leadership?”
'36': >-
  “And your mother—blind and aged, an ascetic woman—how shall I support her,
  wretched, longing for her son?”
'37': >-
  “Stay—do not go, my son, to the abode of Yama. Tomorrow you shall go with me,
  and with your mother too, well accompanied.”
'38': >-
  “Both of us, tormented by grief, helpless and pitiable in the forest, shall
  quickly go to Yama’s realm, bereft of you.”
'39': >-
  “Then, seeing Vaivasvata (Yama), I shall speak to him: ‘May the King of Dharma
  have patience; let him bear with these two parents.’”
'40': >-
  “That righteous-souled, greatly renowned guardian of the worlds is fit to
  grant to me—such as I am—an inexhaustible gift: a single boon as dakṣiṇā, free
  from fear.”
'41': >-
  “You are sinless, my son, though slain by one of sinful deed. By that truth,
  go quickly to those worlds that belong to warriors of weapons.”
'42': >-
  “The heroic attain that course which those who never turn back in battles
  attain; slain facing the foe, my son—go to that supreme state.”
'43': >-
  “That state which Sagara, Śaibya, Dilīpa, Janamejaya, Nahusha, and Dhundhumāra
  attained—go to that, dear child.”
'44': >-
  “That state which belongs to all the virtuous; which comes from Vedic study
  and from austerity; from gifting land; from maintaining the sacred fires; and
  from the vow of fidelity to one spouse—go to that state, dear child.”
'45': >-
  “That state which is of those who give a thousand cows; of those who serve
  their gurus; and of those who lay down the body (renouncing life in a holy
  manner)—go to that state, dear child.”
'46': >-
  “Indeed, none born in this lineage goes to an evil state. But he shall go to
  such a state—he by whom you were slain, my kinsman.”
'47': >-
  Thus he lamented there piteously again and again. Then, together with his
  wife, he set about making the libation of water (udaka) for him.
'48': >-
  But the son of the sage, by the power of his own deeds, taking on a divine
  form, swiftly ascended to heaven together with Śakra, he who knew dharma.
'49': >-
  And that ascetic spoke to those two aged parents along with Śakra; and,
  comforting his parents for a moment, he spoke these words:
'50': >-
  “A great station have I attained through your service. You too shall swiftly
  reach my very source (that same state).”
'51': >-
  Having spoken thus, the sage’s son—self‑controlled—mounted at once the radiant
  divine aerial car and quickly rose to heaven.
'52': >-
  Then the great and radiant ascetic, having promptly performed the water‑rite
  together with his wife, spoke to me as I stood with joined palms.
'53': >-
  “Slay me this very day, O King; in death there is no pain for me—since, with
  one arrow, you have made me sonless.”
'54': >-
  “But since my pure son was slain by you through ignorance, I shall curse you
  with sorrow—most grievous and exceedingly terrible.”
'55': >-
  “The grief born of calamity to one’s child which is mine at present—so shall
  you, O King, meet your end through grief for your son.”
'56': >-
  “And because this sage was slain by you, a kṣatriya, through ignorance,
  therefore the sin of brahma‑slaughter shall not swiftly enter you, O lord of
  men.”
'57': >-
  “Yet upon you too this very state will quickly come—terrible, bringing life to
  its end—like a dakṣiṇā (gift-fee) returning upon its giver.”
'58': >-
  Thus, laying the curse upon me and lamenting much in great compassion, that
  couple placed their bodies upon the funeral pyre and went to heaven.
'59': >-
  Thinking of that, the sin was remembered by me of my own accord—done in my
  boyhood, O goddess, by one who practiced ‘sound‑piercing’ (shooting by sound
  alone).”
'60': >-
  “This, O goddess, is the ripening of that deed that has now come upon me—like
  a disease arising from the very essence of food eaten together with what is
  unwholesome.”
'61': >-
  “Therefore, O auspicious one, that word of the noble sage has now come to
  me—that I shall abandon my life today through grief for my son.”
'62': >-
  “With my eyes I do not see you, Kausalyā; touch me well.” So saying, weeping
  and terrified, the lord of the earth spoke to his wife.
'63': >-
  “This, O goddess, is befitting of me—what I did to Rāghava; and befitting of
  that very deed is what has been done to me by him (the fruit of karma).”
'64': >-
  “Who, though discerning, would abandon his son on earth even if he were
  ill‑conducted? And what son, when being banished, would not reproach his
  father?”
'65': >-
  “If Rāma were to touch me even once today, or if I could gain but that (one
  meeting), then, having reached Yama’s realm, men would not behold me again.”
'66': >-
  “With my eyes I do not see you; my memory is failing. These are the messengers
  of Vaivasvata (Yama), Kausalyā; they are hurrying me along.”
'67': >-
  “What, then, is more painful than this—that at the ending of my life I do not
  behold Rāma, knower of dharma, whose prowess is true?”
'68': >-
  “The grief born of not seeing my son—against which there is no remedy—dries up
  my life-breath, as a wilderness is dried by but a little water (that is
  withheld).”
'69': >-
  “Not for you are those men, nor for you those gods, who will behold the face
  of Rāma—adorned with lovely auspicious earrings—again in the fifteenth year.”
'70': >-
  “Lotus‑petal eyes, fair-browed, with fine teeth, and a beautiful nose—blessed
  are they who will behold the moon‑like face of Rāma, resembling the lord of
  stars.”
'71': >-
  “Like the autumnal moon and like a fully blossomed lotus, fragrant—the blessed
  will behold that face of my lord.”
'72': >-
  “Happy are they who will behold Rāma returned again to Ayodhyā when his
  forest-dwelling is completed—like bright Venus moving on its path.”
'73': >-
  “Kausalyā, through delusion of mind my heart seems to sink. I do not even
  perceive, as though released, sound, touch, and taste.”
'74': >-
  “With the ruin of my mind, all my senses indeed fail—like the rays of a lamp
  whose oil is exhausted, clinging yet (and then fading).”
'75': >-
  “This grief born of myself overwhelms me—helpless and unconscious—with speed,
  as the river’s rush wears down its bank.”
'76': >-
  “Alas, Rāghava, mighty-armed! Alas, remover of my toil! Alas, my refuge, dear
  to your father—alas, my son, where have you gone today?”
'77': >-
  “Alas, Kausalyā—I perish! Alas, Sumitrā, woman of austerity! Alas, ruthless
  Kaikeyī, my enemy, the defilement of the dynasty!”
'78': >-
  Thus, in the presence of Rāma’s mother and of Sumitrā, King Daśaratha,
  grieving, reached the end of his life.
'79': >-
  And as the lord of men spoke thus in misery—afflicted by the banishment of his
  beloved son—when half the night had passed, grievously oppressed by sorrow,
  that noble‑visaged one gave up his life-breath.
'80': >-
  Thus ends the sixty‑fourth sarga, named “The Account of Daśaratha”, in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
