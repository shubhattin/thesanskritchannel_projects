  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-seventh chapter, called “The Account of the Prowess of Hara and the
  Other Vānara Heroes.”
'1': >-
  “Those leaders of monkey-bands I shall now describe to you, as you look
  on—those who, having marched forth for Rāghava’s cause, do not safeguard their
  own lives.”
'2': >-
  “They are loyal; their arms are mighty and well-developed; they bear long
  tails. Some are copper-hued, some yellow, some pale, some white—scattered
  about, doers of dreadful deeds.”
'3': >-
  “When they seize their weapons and stand ready, they shine like the rays of
  the sun; and they drag (great objects) along the earth. This vānara is named
  Hara.”
'4': >-
  “Behind him follow, by hundreds and by thousands, those intent on scaling
  Laṅkā, suddenly lifting up trees with force.”
'5': >-
  “The leaders of troops—servants of the king of monkeys—stand present there,
  whom you see, like great dark-blue clouds as they stand.”
'6': >-
  “They resemble dark collyrium; in battle their prowess is true and proven.
  They are countless, impossible to enumerate—like the far shore of the ocean.”
'7': >-
  “From mountains, from various regions, and from rivers as well—these terrible
  bears are advancing toward you, O king.”
'8': >-
  “In their midst, O king, stands one with dreadful eyes and fearful aspect,
  surrounded on every side by bears as a rain-cloud is by masses of clouds.”
'9': >-
  “Dwelling on Ṛkṣavat, that best of mountains, and drinking the waters of the
  Narmadā, he is the lord of all bears; this troop-leader is named Dhūmra.”
'10': >-
  “And behold his younger brother—like a mountain in appearance—equal to his
  brother in form, yet surpassing him in valor.”
'11': >-
  “He is named Jāmbavān, the great leader of leaders of troops—calm, obedient to
  elders, and in encounters intolerant of affront.”
'12': >-
  “Through him, mighty aid was rendered to the wise Śakra (Indra) in the war of
  gods and asuras; and by Jāmbavān many boons were obtained.”
'13': >-
  “Climbing the peaks of mountains, they hurl enormous, broad rocks; of huge
  form, they let them fly, and they do not fear death.”
'14': >-
  “Like rākṣasas, and shaggy like piśācas, many of his troops of immeasurable
  might range about.”
'15': >-
  “When he becomes enraged—leaping and poised—then all the vānara hosts stand
  watching that leader of leaders of troops.”
'16': >-
  “This lord of monkeys, O king, attends upon the thousand-eyed one (Indra).
  Endowed with great strength and power, this troop-leader is named Dambha.”
'17': >-
  “While moving, he can pass by the side of a mountain that stands a yojana (in
  extent); and likewise, by an upward motion of his body, he can reach a
  yojana.”
'18': >-
  “Since among four-footed beings no higher form is found, there is heard of one
  named Saṃnādana, the grandsire of the vānara race.”
'19': >-
  “It was he who once joined battle, on the battlefield, with the wise Śakra—and
  he did not meet with defeat. He is this leader of leaders of troops.”
'20': >-
  “In his advancing valor he is like Śakra himself in prowess. He was born of a
  Gandharva maiden, of the dark path (Kṛṣṇavartman).”
'21': >-
  “In that war of gods and asuras, for the aid of the dwellers in heaven—there
  where King Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera) resorts to Jambū—”
'22': >-
  “—he who is lord of the kingly mountains, served by many Kinnaras, ever
  granting the delight of recreation to your brother, O lord of rākṣasas—”
'23': >-
  “—there this illustrious and mighty best of vānara heroes takes his pleasure.
  Ever unboastful in battles, this troop-leader is named Krathana.”
'24': >-
  “Surrounded by a thousand crores of monkeys, standing well arrayed, he too
  longs to crush Laṅkā with his own host.”
'25': >-
  “He who ranges along the Gaṅgā, terrifying the leaders of elephant-herds,
  remembering the former enmity between elephants and monkeys—”
'26': >-
  “—this troop-lord and commander, roaring, dwelling in mountain-caves, checks
  the wild elephants and breaks the great trees.”
'27': >-
  “Chief of the monkey-hosts, along the river Haimavatī, resorting to
  usīra-seed, he inhabits Mandara, the foremost of mountains.”
'28': >-
  “That best of monkeys delights there, like Śakra himself in heaven. Toward him
  advances a thousand out of a hundred thousand (monkeys).”
'29': >-
  “Of those proud in strength and valor, roaring, strong-armed—he is the leader
  of these great-souled monkeys.”
'30': >-
  “This troop-leader, O king, is hard to withstand—named Pramāthī—whom you
  behold, like a cloud driven up and hurled by the wind.”
'31': >-
  “Even the host of swift and impetuous monkeys appears, all around, lifted up
  and whirled by the wind, glowing with a reddish radiance.”
'32': >-
  “Turning again and again, where this thick dust spreads—these are the
  dark-faced, dreadful, red-tailed, great-strong ones.”
'33': >-
  “Having seen the building of the bridge—hundreds of hundreds of
  thousands—(behold) that red-tailed troop-leader, O great king, named Gavākṣa.”
'34': >-
  “Surrounding him, they roar, longing to crush Laṅkā by force—where there are
  wish-fulfilling trees at all seasons, frequented by swarms of bees.”
'35': >-
  “A mountain, sunlike in color, circles round (as it were); by whose radiance
  the beasts and birds ever shine with that very hue.”
'36': >-
  “Whose plateau the great sages do not abandon; whose trees bear all desires,
  ever laden with fruit.”
'37': >-
  “And on that best of mountains are precious honeys. There, O king, he
  delights—on that lovely golden mountain.”
'38': >-
  “The foremost among the foremost of monkeys, a troop-leader named
  Keśarī—(there are) sixty thousand mountains, delightful and golden.”
'39': >-
  “In their midst is an excellent mountain—like you yourself, O faultless one,
  among rākṣasas. There some are tawny, some white; with coppery faces and
  honey-brown hues.”
'40': >-
  “They dwell on the last mountain—sharp-fanged, with claws for weapons; like
  lions with four fangs, and like tigers, difficult to approach.”
'41': >-
  “All of them are like Vaiśvānara (fire), like blazing venomous serpents; with
  very long, curved tails, like intoxicated lordly elephants.”
'42': >-
  “Like great mountains in stature, with the roar of huge thunderclouds; with
  round tawny eyes indeed, and a mighty, dreadful, rushing sound in their gait.”
'43': >-
  “Gazing at Laṅkā, they all stood as though they would crush you; and their
  valiant lord stands in the middle among them.”
'44': >-
  “Ever seeking victory, the mighty one worships the Sun. He is famed on earth
  by name, O king, as Śatabalī.”
'45': >-
  “He too longs to crush Laṅkā with his own host—bold, mighty, heroic, firmly
  established in his manly valor.”
'46': >-
  “For the sake of what is dear to Rāma, the monkey shows no compassion toward
  his own life: Gaja, Gavākṣa, Gavaya, Nala, and the monkey Nīla.”
'47': >-
  “Each single one of these warriors is encompassed by ten crores (of
  followers). Likewise, other foremost monkeys, dwellers on the Vindhya
  mountain—because of their vast numbers, men of swift valor cannot be counted.”
'48': >-
  “All of them, O great king, are of great might; all of them have bodies like
  huge mountains; all of them are capable, in a moment, of making the earth
  shattered and strewn with scattered rocks.”
'49': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-seventh chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, called “The Account of the Prowess of Hara and
  the Other Vānara Heroes.”
