  Now begins, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-eighth sarga, called “Jābāli’s Speech.”
'1': >-
  While Bharata was being consoled, Jābāli—the foremost of Brāhmaṇas—spoke these
  words to Rāma, the knower of dharma, yet (as it were) fallen away from dharma.
'2': >-
  “Well said, O Rāghava; let not your understanding become thus purposeless and
  vain—like the understanding of an ordinary man—(you) who are high-minded, of
  noble intellect.”
'3': >-
  “Who is kin to whom? What indeed is truly ‘one’s own,’ belonging to anyone
  through anyone at all—when a creature is born alone, and alone indeed
  perishes?”
'4': >-
  “Therefore, O Rāma, a man should not cling (thinking), ‘mother’ and ‘father.’
  He should be known as one deluded, as though mad; for no one truly belongs to
  anyone.”
'5': >-
  “Just as some man, going to another village, may dwell somewhere for a time,
  and then, abandoning that lodging, depart on the following day,”
'6': >-
  “even so, for human beings, father, mother, home, and wealth are only a
  temporary lodging, O descendant of Kakutstha. The wise do not become attached
  to these.”
'7': >-
  “Having abandoned the ancestral kingdom, you ought not, O best of men, to take
  to an evil path—painful, uneven, and bristling with many thorns.”
'8': >-
  “In prosperous Ayodhyā, have yourself anointed (as king). The city, with hair
  bound in a single braid (in widow-like mourning), now awaits you.”
'9': >-
  “Enjoying royal pleasures of great value, O son of a king, sport in
  Ayodhyā—just as Śakra (Indra) in Triviṣṭapa (heaven).”
'10': >-
  “Daśaratha is no one to you, and you are no one to him. He is one king; you
  are another. Therefore do as is being said (to you).”
'11': >-
  “A father is but the mere seed for a creature—white (semen) and blood alone.
  Joined with the mother’s season, that is the birth of a man here.”
'12': >-
  “That king has gone there—where he indeed had to go. Such is the course of
  mortals; but you are being vainly obstructed (held back) by false notions.”
'13': >-
  “Those who are devoted to artha and dharma—those and those alone do I lament,
  not others; for they, having obtained suffering here, attained destruction
  after death.”
'14': >-
  “‘The Aṣṭakā offerings are for the Pitṛ-deities’—thus is this belief spread
  among people. See the harm done to food (wasted thereby); for what remains to
  a dead man?”
'15': >-
  “If what is eaten here by one person goes to the body of another, then one
  should offer śrāddha to a man who has gone on a journey; yet that would not
  become wholesome nourishment for him.”
'16': >-
  “These treatises have been composed by the intelligent as a means of inducing
  gifts: ‘Sacrifice; give; take initiation; practice austerities; abandon (this
  and that).’”
'17': >-
  “Therefore, O great-minded one, form the understanding that there is no
  ‘beyond’ (no afterlife). Stand by what is directly perceived; put what is
  unseen behind you.”
'18': >-
  “Holding that understanding in front—one that is, as it were, an example held
  up for all the world—accept the kingdom, you who have been appeased by
  Bharata.”
'19': >-
  Thus ends, in the sacred, illustrious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki—the Ādikāvya—in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, the one-hundred-and-eighth sarga, called “Jābāli’s Speech.”
