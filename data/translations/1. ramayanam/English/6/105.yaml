'0': >-
  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-fifth sarga, entitled “The Bewildering of Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa).”
'1': >-
  But he—Rāvaṇa, famed in battle—being then sorely afflicted by that scion of
  the Kakutsthas through wrath, was seized by an exceeding great fury.
'2': >-
  With eyes blazing, and from intolerant anger, that mighty hero, lifting his
  bow, assailed Rāghava with deep indignation in the supreme combat.
'3': >-
  With those thousands of torrents of arrows, Rāvaṇa, like a rain-cloud pouring
  from the sky, filled Rāghava with shafts as though he were a lake being
  flooded.
'4': >-
  Though in the fight he was filled with a net of arrows discharged from the
  bow, Kakutstha—immovable like a mighty mountain—did not tremble.
'5': >-
  Standing firm in battle, that valiant one warded off those nets of arrows with
  his own shafts, even as one might receive and check the sun’s rays.
'6': >-
  Then the swift-handed night-ranger, enraged, struck the great-souled Rāghava
  on the chest with thousands of arrows.
'7': >-
  Smeared all over with blood in that combat, the elder brother of Lakṣmaṇa was
  seen like a very great kiṃśuka tree in the forest, in full bloom.
'8': >-
  Stirred to wrath by the blows of arrows, Kakutstha—of vast effulgence, radiant
  like the sun at the end of an age—seized up his arrows.
'9': >-
  Then those two, Rāma and Rāvaṇa, mutually enraged, in the battle made dark by
  arrows, could not clearly perceive one another at that time.
'10': >-
  Then Rāma, son of Daśaratha, possessed by anger, the heroic one laughed and
  spoke to Rāvaṇa harsh words.
'11': >-
  My wife, from Janasthāna, was carried away by you, O vilest of rākṣasas,
  helpless, through my unknowing; therefore you are not truly a man of valor.
'12': >-
  Having violently seized Vaidehī while she was separated from me, wretched,
  dwelling in the great forest—do you deem, ‘I am a hero’?!
'13': >-
  O ‘hero’ among women who are without protector—laying hands on another’s wife,
  doing a contemptible deed of a coward—do you deem, ‘I am a hero’?!
'14': >-
  O you who have broken all bounds, shameless, unsteady in conduct—through
  arrogance taking death upon yourself—do you deem, ‘I am a hero’?!
'15': >-
  By you, together with your forces, and with Kubera’s heroic brother—an act has
  indeed been done: great, worthy of proclamation, and famed.
'16': >-
  Now, today, receive the exceedingly great fruit of that deed—of one overcome
  by pride, blameworthy and harmful.
'17': >-
  You imagine yourself, O evil-minded one, to be a hero; yet you have no shame,
  carrying off Sītā like a thief.
'18': >-
  If Sītā had been violated by you by force in my very presence, then you would
  have beheld your brother Khara slain by my arrows.
'19': >-
  By good fortune, O base-minded one, you have come within the range of my
  sight; today, with sharp arrows, I shall send you to Yama’s abode.
'20': >-
  Today, with my arrows, your head—adorned with blazing earrings—shall be
  severed; let flesh-eaters drag it about, scattered in the dust of battle.
'21': >-
  When you, Rāvaṇa, are cast down upon the earth, let vultures, falling upon
  your chest, drink in their thirst the blood welling up between the
  arrow-wounds.
'22': >-
  Today, when you are pierced by my arrows, lifeless and fallen, let birds tear
  out your entrails—like Garuḍa dragging serpents.
'23': >-
  Thus speaking, that hero Rāma, the subduer of foes, showered the rākṣasa-lord
  who stood near with volleys of arrows.
'24': >-
  In the combat, Rāma’s valor, strength, and exultation became doubled, and also
  his might of weapons—since he longed for the enemy’s death.
'25': >-
  All his weapons manifested forth for that knower of the Self; and from
  exhilaration, that great-souled one became even swifter of hand.
'26': >-
  Recognizing these auspicious signs arisen within himself, Rāma, the destroyer
  of rākṣasas, pressed Rāvaṇa still more fiercely.
'27': >-
  And Daśagrīva, being struck by the troops of monkeys with heaps of stones and
  by Rāghava’s showers of arrows, became shaken at heart and bewildered.
'28': >-
  When he could no longer take up a weapon, nor draw his bow, his valor did not
  answer—his inner spirit having become faint.
'29': >-
  And the arrows swiftly hurled by him, and the various weapons too, served only
  toward death; the time of death drew near.
'30': >-
  But his charioteer, seeing him in that condition, unconfused, slowly drove his
  chariot away from the battle.
'31': >-
  And then the charioteer, swiftly restraining that dreadful chariot which
  rumbled like a cloud, departed in fear from the battlefield, having beheld the
  king laid low, his prowess gone, and fallen.
'32': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vedic seers’ tradition, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the primeval epic, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the one-hundred-and-fifth sarga
  entitled “The Bewildering of Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa).”
