  Now, in the blessed Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fourteenth canto named “The Exploration of the Aśoka Grove.”
'1': >-
  He, the mighty one of great splendour, reflected as it were for a moment; and,
  having ascertained that place in his mind, he sprang and leapt upon the
  rampart of that mansion.
'2': >-
  Standing upon the wall, that great monkey, with all his limbs thrilled with
  delight, beheld in the beginning of spring many kinds of trees with flowering
  tops.
'3': >-
  He saw sāla-trees and aśoka-trees, and splendid champaka-trees in full bloom;
  uddālaka-trees, nāga-trees, mango-trees, and even the ‘kapi-mukha’ trees.
'4': >-
  Beholding it rich with mango-groves and adorned with hundreds of creepers, he
  sprang into that garden of trees like an arrow released from the bowstring.
'5': >-
  Entering that wondrous grove, resounding with the cries of birds, and enclosed
  on every side with trees of silver and of gold, he went within.
'6': >-
  That powerful Hanumān beheld that marvellously variegated woodland, thronged
  with birds and herds of deer, shining like the risen sun.
'7': >-
  He saw it covered with many kinds of trees—laden with blossoms and laden with
  fruits—ever frequented by cuckoos and intoxicated bhṛṅgarāja-bees.
'8': >-
  At that season it was filled with delighted creatures; it was crowded with
  deer, birds, and maddened bees; it rang with the calls of intoxicated peacocks
  and was thronged with multitudes of different birds.
'9': >-
  While seeking that faultless princess of noble hips, the monkey startled and
  awakened the birds that were sleeping peacefully.
'10': >-
  As the flocks of birds sprang up, struck by the flapping of wings and stirred
  by the winds, showers of blossoms—many-coloured and diverse—were released.
'11': >-
  Strewn all over with flowers, Hanumān, son of the Wind-god, shone in the midst
  of the Aśoka grove like a mountain made of blossoms.
'12': >-
  Seeing the monkey rushing in all directions among masses of trees, all
  creatures there imagined, “Spring itself has come.”
'13': >-
  There the earth, covered with various blossoms fallen from the trees, shone
  like a young woman beautifully adorned.
'14': >-
  Those trees, shaken greatly by the impetuous one with his force, then
  scattered forth blossoms of many wondrous kinds because of that monkey.
'15': >-
  With leaf-crowns shaken off, their blossoms and fruits shed, the trees looked
  like defeated rogues, their garments and ornaments cast down.
'16': >-
  Shaken by swift Hanumān, those excellent fruit-bearing trees quickly let fall
  their blossoms, leaves, and fruits.
'17': >-
  Deprived of flocks of birds, those trees—now with only bare trunks and
  branches to cling to—were all left hard to climb, shaken violently by the
  wind-like force.
'18': >-
  Like a young woman with dishevelled hair, her complexion marred—her good teeth
  and lips bruised, and scratched by nails and bitten by teeth—
'19': >-
  —so too that Aśoka grove, with its forest-trees broken, was crushed and
  trampled by his tail and hands, and by his feet as well.
'20': >-
  With speed the monkey shattered the garlands and festoons of great creepers,
  as the wind in the rainy season, with its force, breaks apart masses of
  clouds.
'21': >-
  There the monkey, moving about, beheld charming grounds of gems, of silver,
  and likewise grounds of gold.
'22': >-
  He saw pools of various shapes, filled with most excellent water, here and
  there furnished with splendid stairways of precious gems.
'23': >-
  Their sands were pearls and coral; their pavements were inlaid with crystal;
  their banks were adorned with wondrous golden trees.
'24': >-
  They were filled with blooming lotus and blue-lotus groves; they were
  beautified by cakravāka birds; they resounded with the cries of natyūha birds,
  and were vocal with swans and cranes.
'25': >-
  All around were long streams lined with trees, their waters like nectar,
  auspicious and well-ordered.
'26': >-
  They were overhung by hundreds of creepers and covered with clusters of
  santāna-blossoms; their woods were veiled by many shrubs, and within were made
  lovely by karavīra plants.
'27': >-
  Then he saw a mountain like a mass of clouds, its summit grown lofty, with
  many marvellous peaks, and ringed on all sides by other peaks.
'28': >-
  That tiger among monkeys beheld that delightful mountain upon the earth,
  spread over with stone-houses and covered with trees of many kinds.
'29': >-
  From that mountain the monkey also saw a river rushing down—springing forth as
  though from a lap—like a beloved woman fallen away from her beloved.
'30': >-
  Adorned with trees whose tips dipped into the water, it appeared like an angry
  maiden being held back by her dear companions.
'31': >-
  And that great monkey saw its water turning back again, like a beloved wife
  returning—serene—once more to her lover.
'32': >-
  Not far from there, Hanumān—the tiger among monkeys, son of the
  Wind-god—beheld lotus-ponds thronged with multitudes of diverse birds.
'33': >-
  He also saw an artificial long tank, filled with cool water, with stairways of
  excellent gems, beautified with sands of pearls.
'34': >-
  He beheld a woodland marvellously varied, with herds of different deer, and
  with very lofty mansions built by Viśvakarmā.
'35': >-
  And it was adorned on every side with artificial groves as well. Whatever
  trees were there, they were laden with blossoms and laden with fruits.
'36': >-
  All had canopies and railings, all had golden platforms, and were covered with
  many tendrils of creepers and with many leaves.
'37': >-
  That great monkey beheld one golden śiṃśapā tree, encircled on every side by
  platforms made of gold.
'38': >-
  He saw portions of ground and waterfalls from the mountain; and he also saw
  other golden trees, gleaming like peacocks.
'39': >-
  By the radiance of those trees, like that of Mount Meru, the heroic great
  monkey then thought, “Everywhere I am as though made of gold.”
'40': >-
  Seeing those golden clusters of trees shaken by the wind, sounding with the
  tinkling of hundreds of little bells, he was filled with amazement.
'41': >-
  Then, with great speed, he climbed that leaf-covered śiṃśapā tree, whose tops
  were beautifully in bloom, with tender sprouts and young shoots.
'42': >-
  “From here I shall behold Vaidehī, longing for the sight of Rāma—distressed
  with sorrow—wandering hither and thither by chance.”
'43': >-
  “This Aśoka grove surely is exceedingly delightful, though it belongs to the
  wicked one; it is adorned with sandal-trees, champakas, and bakula-trees.”
'44': >-
  “And this lovely lotus-pond, frequented by flocks of birds—surely that queen
  Jānakī will come to this.”
'45': >-
  “She is Rāma’s queen, the virtuous beloved of Rāghava; skilled in moving about
  in forests—Jānakī will certainly come.”
'46': >-
  “Or else, the doe-eyed lady, well acquainted with this forest, worn down by
  the anguish of thinking of Rāma, will come into this grove even today.”
'47': >-
  “Afflicted by Rāma’s grief, that goddess of lovely eyes—ever delighting in
  forest-dwelling—will come, moving about in the forest.”
'48': >-
  “Surely, the virtuous daughter of Janaka, beloved companion of Rāma, has long
  yearned continually for the ways of those who dwell in the woods.”
'49': >-
  “Her mind set on the twilight hour, that dark-hued Jānakī will certainly come;
  and this river too, with auspicious waters, will the fair-complexioned lady
  approach for her evening rites.”
'50': >-
  “And this auspicious Aśoka grove is fitting for her—the auspicious consort,
  approved wife of Rāma, lord among kings.”
'51': >-
  “If that देवी lives, her face like the lord of the stars (the moon), she will
  surely come to this river of cool waters.”
'52': >-
  Thus thinking, great-souled Hanumān waited for the consort of the lord of men;
  and, concealed amid the dense leaves of the profusely flowering tree, he
  watched and observed everything.
'53': >-
  Thus ends the fourteenth canto, named “The Exploration of the Aśoka Grove,” in
  the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
