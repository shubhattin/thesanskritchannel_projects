'0': >-
  Then, in the holy and glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-second chapter, called “The Sacrifice of Ambarīṣa.”
'1': >-
  Having taken hold of Śunaḥśepa, that highly renowned king rested at Puṣkara at
  midday, O Raghunandana (delighter of the Raghu line).
'2': >-
  While that king was resting, Śunaḥśepa, the illustrious one, came to Puṣkara
  the elder (the chief Puṣkara) and indeed beheld Viśvāmitra.
'3': >-
  He saw his maternal uncle, tormented by austerities along with the
  ṛṣis—himself exceedingly distressed—his face downcast, wretched, and afflicted
  by thirst and exhaustion.
'4': >-
  Falling into the lap of the sage, O Rāma, he spoke these words: “I have no
  mother, no father; where then are my kinsmen and relatives?”
'5': >-
  “O gentle one, O foremost of sages, you should save me in accordance with
  dharma. You indeed are the protector, O best of men; you are truly the
  benefactor of all.”
'6': >-
  “And the king would have his purpose fulfilled, while I—possessed of long,
  undiminishing life—would partake of the world of heaven, having performed
  unsurpassed austerity.”
'7': >-
  “Therefore become the refuge of me who am without refuge, with a noble intent.
  O righteous-souled one, as a father saves his son, you should save me from
  sin.”
'8': >-
  Hearing those words of his, the great ascetic Viśvāmitra, having consoled him
  in many ways, spoke to his sons as follows:
'9': >-
  “That very end for which fathers, seeking good, beget sons—for the welfare of
  the other world—its time has now arrived.”
'10': >-
  “This boy, the son of a sage, seeks refuge in me. By the mere preserving of
  his life, do what is dear to me, my sons.”
'11': >-
  “All of you are doers of meritorious deeds; all of you are devoted to dharma.
  Become the sacrificial animal for the king, and grant satisfaction to Agni.”
'12': >-
  “Thus Śunaḥśepa will have a protector, and the sacrifice will proceed without
  obstacle; the deities will be satisfied, and my word too will have been
  carried out.”
'13': >-
  On hearing the sage’s words, his sons—beginning with Madhucchandas—spoke, O
  best of men, with pride and with tears, saying:
'14': >-
  “How, O Lord, abandoning your own sons, do you seek to save another’s son? We
  regard this as improper—like dog’s flesh in a meal.”
'15': >-
  Hearing those words of his sons, that foremost of sages, his eyes reddened
  with anger, began to utter (a response).
'16': >-
  “This has been spoken without propriety, and is censured even by
  dharma—transgressing my command—cruel and hair-raising.”
'17': >-
  “All of you shall become eaters of dog’s flesh, like the Vasiṣṭhas in their
  births, and you shall dwell upon the earth for a full thousand years.”
'18': >-
  Having thus laid that curse upon his sons, the excellent sage then addressed
  the afflicted Śunaḥśepa, having made a protective charm for him, free from
  ailment:
'19': >-
  “Bound with the sacred nooses (pavitra-bonds), adorned with red garlands and
  unguents, and having approached the Vaiṣṇava sacrificial post, invoke Agni
  with words (hymns).”
'20': >-
  “And you shall sing these two divine gāthās, O son of a sage. In this
  sacrifice of Ambarīṣa, thereafter you will attain success.”
'21': >-
  Śunaḥśepa, having received those two gāthās, and being well-composed and fully
  attentive, quickly spoke to that lion among kings, Ambarīṣa:
'22': >-
  “O lion among kings, O great-minded one, let us go swiftly. O lord of kings,
  bring the consecration to an end and proclaim it (i.e., proceed to the next
  rite).”
'23': >-
  Hearing that speech of the ṛṣi’s son, the king, filled with joy, went quickly
  and without slackness to the sacrificial enclosure.
'24': >-
  With the assent of the officiants, the king, having performed the requisite
  purificatory marks, clothed the victim in red garments and bound him to the
  sacrificial post.
'25': >-
  Thus bound, the sage’s son praised with excellent utterances the two
  gods—Indra and Indra’s younger brother—duly, as prescribed.
'26': >-
  Then the thousand-eyed Vāsava (Indra), pleased and satisfied by that secret
  (mystic) hymn of praise, granted long life to Śunaḥśepa.
'27': >-
  And the king, O best of men, also completed the sacrifice, obtaining manifold
  fruit, O Rāma, born of the favor of the thousand-eyed one.
'28': >-
  Viśvāmitra too, righteous-souled and of great austerity, again performed tapas
  at Puṣkara, O best of men, for ten hundreds of years.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-second chapter, called “The Sacrifice of Ambarīṣa,” in the
  Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
