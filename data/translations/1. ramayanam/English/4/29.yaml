'0': >-
  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the
  twenty-ninth chapter, called “The Rousing (Admonition) of Hanumān.”
'1': >-
  Having beheld the spotless sky, freed from lightning and from cloud-masses;
  resounding with the calls of flocks of sārasas (cranes); and made beautiful as
  though anointed with the loveliness of moonlight,
'2': >-
  and having observed Sugrīva—abounding in prosperity, yet slack in the
  gathering of dharma and artha; greatly turned aside into the path of the
  unrighteous; his mind fixed wholly in solitary enjoyment,
'3': >-
  one whose undertakings had ceased, whose aims were fulfilled, ever devoted to
  delights with women, having obtained all his long-desired wishes—every one of
  his heart’s intentions,
'4': >-
  with his own beloved wife Tārā, also sought and obtained, sporting day and
  night, satisfied of purpose, with fever (of anxiety) gone from him,
'5': >-
  like the Lord of the gods disporting with companies of Gandharvas and
  Apsarases; having entrusted his affairs to his ministers, yet not attending to
  the ministers,
'6': >-
  his doubt concerning the kingdom cut off, standing as one established in the
  conduct of pleasure;—then the son of the Wind-god (Hanumān), resolute of
  purpose, knower of the truth of policy, discerning the special obligations of
  time and circumstance,
'7': >-
  appeased the lord of the monkeys—skilled in speech and knowing the essence of
  speech—by many kinds of reasoned, pleasing, and persuasive words.
'8': >-
  Those words were beneficial, true, and wholesome; endowed with the policy of
  conciliation and with dharma and artha; joined with affection and
  friendliness; and framed to establish trust and firm resolve.
'9': >-
  Approaching the lord of the monkeys, Hanumān spoke these words: “You have
  regained your kingdom; your fame too (has increased); and the splendor of your
  lineage has been augmented.
'10': >-
  But one duty remains—the safeguarding and fulfillment of friendship; that,
  sir, you ought to do. For he who understands the proper time in matters
  concerning friends, and ever acts rightly toward them,
'11': >-
  for him, both sovereignty and renown and valor increase. O king of the
  monkeys, he in whom these are all equal—treasury, punitive power, friends, and
  his own self—he attains great dominion.
'12': >-
  Therefore you, possessed of good conduct, established on an unfailing path,
  should duly carry out what is fitting in the interest of your friend, with
  proper and well-ordered effort.
'13': >-
  He who, abandoning all other concerns, does not act for a friend’s sake—his
  energy, thrown into confusion by heedlessness, does not escape calamities.
'14': >-
  For he who applies himself to a friend’s work after the right time has
  passed—though he accomplish even great advantages—does not truly succeed in
  serving the friend’s cause.
'15': >-
  This duty to our friend has now become overdue, O subduer of foes. Let this be
  done: the searching out of Vaidehī (Sītā) for Rāghava.
'16': >-
  Yet the knower of time (Rāma) does not inform you that the time has passed;
  even while hastening, that wise one, O king, follows your will and remains
  under your control (out of regard and restraint).
'17': >-
  Rāghava is the cause of your flourishing line, a kinsman bound to you in
  lasting friendship; of immeasurable might; and himself unequaled in virtues.
'18': >-
  Therefore do for him the work that he earlier did for you. O lord of the
  monkeys, best of monkeys, you ought to command the foremost leaders of the
  monkey-bands.
'19': >-
  Indeed, time would not pass without urging; for when a task is urged on, yet
  not accomplished, then occurs the transgression of time.
'20': >-
  Even of work not yet begun, you are the one who can cause it to be done, O
  lord of the monkeys—how much more so when it is a matter of repaying him,
  since you were restored both with kingdom and with the slaying (of your
  enemy).
'21': >-
  O ruler of the hosts of monkeys and bears, mighty and exceedingly
  valiant—knowing (what is due) to please Dāśarathi (Rāma), why do you not set
  yourself to the command?
'22': >-
  Indeed, Dāśarathi, capable by his arrows of bringing gods, demons, and great
  serpents under his power, is waiting upon your pledge (to keep your promise).
'23': >-
  Without fear of giving up his very life, he has done you great kindness. Let
  us search for Vaidehī—on the earth and also in the sky.
'24': >-
  The gods, Dānavas, and Gandharvas, the Asuras along with the Marut hosts—nor
  even the Yakṣas—could cause him fear; what then could the Rākṣasas do?
'25': >-
  Thus, to Rāma, endowed with such strength, who has already repaid you first in
  that manner—O lord with tawny eyes— you ought with your whole being to do what
  is dear (and pleasing) to him.
'26': >-
  Neither below upon the earth, nor in the waters, nor above in the sky is any
  path difficult for any of us, O lord of the monkeys, when it is by your
  command.
'27': >-
  Therefore command: who should determine what is to be done, and from where?
  For your monkeys are irresistible—numbering crores at the forefront, O
  blameless one.
'28': >-
  Hearing that speech, well-reasoned and fitting to the time, Sugrīva, endowed
  with courage, formed an excellent resolve.
'29': >-
  That exceedingly intelligent Sugrīva commanded Nīla—ever constant in prompt
  exertion—(to arrange) the assembling of all the armies, in all directions.
'30': >-
  “So that my army, entire, and the troop-leaders everywhere, may come together
  without obstruction—do thus at the head of the forces.”
'31': >-
  “And those boundary-guarding monkeys, swift-footed and resolute, let them
  quickly bring (the forces); hasten them by my order. And you yourself,
  immediately thereafter, should personally oversee the task.”
'32': >-
  “If any monkey should arrive here after three times five nights (fifteen
  nights), for him the punishment is death; in this there is no deliberation to
  be made.”
'33': >-
  “And you, with Aṅgada, shall go to the aged monkeys, firmly empowered with my
  settled command.” Thus having established this ordinance, the mighty lord
  among the best of monkeys entered his dwelling.
'34': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-ninth chapter of the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa in the sacred
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, called “The Rousing (Admonition) of Hanumān.”
