  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa,
  begins the thirty-sixth chapter, called “The Seeking of Aid.”
'1': >-
  “Mārīca, hear my words, dear one, as I speak. I am afflicted, and for me who
  am afflicted, you indeed are the highest refuge.”
'2': >-
  “You know Janasthāna, where my brother Khara is, and mighty-armed Dūṣaṇa also,
  and my sister Śūrpaṇakhā as well.”
'3': >-
  “And Triśiras too, the mighty-armed rākṣasa, a devourer of flesh; and many
  other valiant night-rangers besides, heroes whose aim has found its mark.”
'4': >-
  “By my command the rākṣasas dwell there and have made their settlement,
  harassing in the great forest those sages who practice righteousness.”
'5': >-
  “Fourteen thousand rākṣasas of dreadful deeds—heroes whose aim has found its
  mark, who follow the bent of Khara’s mind—”
'6': >-
  “Those very powerful ones, dwelling now in Janasthāna, have encountered Rāma
  in battle and been utterly brought under his power.”
'7': >-
  “Armed with weapons of many kinds, those rākṣasas headed by Khara—at the head
  of the fight—were met by Rāma, whose wrath had arisen.”
'8': >-
  “Without uttering even a single harsh word, his bow set to work by his arrows,
  he—Rāma—(slew) fourteen thousand rākṣasas of fierce radiance,”
'9': >-
  “struck down by blazing shafts by a human, a foot-soldier. And Khara was slain
  in the combat, and Dūṣaṇa too was felled.”
'10': >-
  “And having killed Triśiras also, he made the Daṇḍaka forest fearless. One who
  was cast out by his enraged father—together with his wife—(yet) is one whose
  life is now all but spent.”
'11': >-
  “That Rāma, the slayer of that host, is the very scum of kṣatriyas—without
  good conduct, harsh and sharp, foolish, greedy, and with senses unconquered,”
'12': >-
  “one who has abandoned dharma, a man of unrighteous nature, delighting in the
  harm of beings—who in this forest has taken up sheer brute force, without any
  cause for enmity.”
'13': >-
  “By the cutting off of ears and nose my sister has been disfigured. Therefore
  from Janasthāna I shall carry off his wife Sītā, resembling the daughter of
  the gods.”
'14': >-
  “I shall bring her back by valor; be you my helper in that. For with you as my
  helper, standing at my side, O mighty one,”
'15': >-
  “even with all my brothers I do not here reckon upon all the gods. Therefore
  become my ally; you are capable, O rākṣasa.”
'16': >-
  “In prowess, in battle, and in pride there is none equal to you; by stratagem
  you are a great hero, highly skilled in mighty illusion.”
'17': >-
  “For this very purpose have I come near you, O night-ranger. Hear then the
  deed to be done as assistance, which must be carried out according to my
  words.”
'18': >-
  “Become a golden deer, wondrous, with silver spots, and roam before Sītā in
  the hermitage of that Rāma.”
'19': >-
  “And Sītā, seeing you without doubt in the form of a deer, will say to her
  husband—and to Lakṣmaṇa as well—‘Let him be caught!’”
'20': >-
  “Then, when those two are away and Sītā is left alone, at my ease I shall
  carry her off, unimpeded—like Rāhu (seizes) the moon’s radiance.”
'21': >-
  “Thereafter, when Rāma is worn with anguish from the abduction of his wife, I
  shall, with a heart inwardly satisfied, strike him down at leisure,
  unsuspecting.”
'22': >-
  Hearing that account concerning Rāma, the great-souled Mārīca’s mouth became
  dry, and he became exceedingly frightened.
'23': >-
  Licking his dry lips, and with eyes as though unblinking, distressed like one
  already dead, he gazed upon Rāvaṇa.
'24': >-
  Then Mārīca—his mind terrified and despondent, knowing in the great forest the
  prowess of Rāma—having joined his palms, spoke to Rāvaṇa words expressing the
  true situation, beneficial to him, and beneficial to himself as well.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-sixth chapter in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the revered Ādi-kāvya, called “The Seeking of Aid.”
