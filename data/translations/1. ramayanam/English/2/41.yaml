  Now begins the Forty-first Sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Tumult in the City.”
'1': >-
  But when that tiger among men (Rāma) was setting forth, with hands joined in
  reverence, a mighty cry of anguish indeed arose among the women within the
  inner apartments.
'2': >-
  “For this people—helpless, weak, and afflicted—he was the refuge and the
  shelter. Where now does that lord, our protector, go?”
'3': >-
  “He grows not wrathful even when reviled; he avoids all that should provoke
  anger; he pacifies all who are enraged; equal in the sorrows of all—where does
  he go?”
'4': >-
  “As that great-souled, mighty one behaves toward Kauśalyā as toward his own
  mother, so does he conduct himself toward us as well—where now does that
  high-souled Rāma go?”
'5': >-
  “Urged to the forest by the king who is being tormented through Kaikeyī—where
  now does he go, he who is the deliverer of this people, indeed of the whole
  world?”
'6': >-
  “Alas, the king is without discernment, bringing ruin upon the world of the
  living, in that he will send to forest-dwelling Rāma, righteous and bound by
  the vow of truth!”
'7': >-
  Thus all those chief queens, anguished with grief, wept and cried aloud—like
  cows bereft of their calves.
'8': >-
  Hearing that dreadful wail of distress in the inner apartments, the lord of
  the earth (Daśaratha), scorched by grief for his son, became exceedingly
  sorrowful.
'9': >-
  The fire-offerings were not performed; householders did not cook; the citizens
  performed no tasks; and even the sun seemed to vanish from sight.
'10': >-
  Elephants let fall the mouthfuls they held; cows did not suckle their calves;
  and even a mother who had obtained her first-born son felt no joy.
'11': >-
  Triśaṅku and Lohitāṅga, and Bṛhaspati (Jupiter) and Budha (Mercury) too—indeed
  all the planets, ominous and dreadful, having approached the moon, stood as
  though arrayed in threatening formation.
'12': >-
  The stars shone as though their radiance were gone, and the planets too were
  bereft of their splendor; and the Viśākhā (constellation) appeared in the sky
  as if wreathed in smoke.
'13': >-
  When Rāma set forth to the forest, the city shook—like the great ocean risen
  up under the rush of a dark, stormy wind.
'14': >-
  All the quarters became confounded, as though enveloped in darkness; neither
  planet nor constellation, nothing at all, gave forth its light.
'15': >-
  Suddenly all the people of the city fell into dejection; in eating or in
  recreation no one’s mind took delight.
'16': >-
  Ever scorched by successive waves of grief, continually drawing long sighs,
  all the people in Ayodhyā cried out to the lord of the earth.
'17': >-
  With faces bewildered by tears, the people thronging the royal highway—no one
  could be found cheerful; all were wholly given over to sorrow.
'18': >-
  The cool breeze did not blow; the moon did not appear with its gentle aspect;
  the sun did not warm the world—everything in the universe was thrown into
  turmoil.
'19': >-
  Sons without purpose, husbands and brothers of women likewise—all, abandoning
  everything, thought only upon Rāma.
'20': >-
  And all who were Rāma’s friends—bereft of sense, overwhelmed by the heavy
  burden of grief—did not even take to their beds.
'21': >-
  Then Ayodhyā, bereft of that great-souled one, trembled like the earth with
  its mountains when Indra, the destroyer of citadels, is gone; aflame with
  terrible fear and sorrow, with its elephants, warriors, horses, and hosts, it
  resounded with a dreadful roar.
'22': >-
  Thus ends the Forty-first Sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Tumult in the
  City.”
