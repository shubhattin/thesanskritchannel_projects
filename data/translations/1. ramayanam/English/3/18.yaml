  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  eighteenth canto, named “The Disfigurement of Śūrpaṇakhā.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, seeing that Śūrpaṇakhā was bound fast in the noose of desire,
  addressed her of his own accord with gentle, smooth words, preceded by a
  smile.
'2': >-
  Lady, I am one who has taken a wife; this is my beloved consort. But for women
  such as you, to have a co-wife is exceedingly painful indeed.
'3': >-
  There is my younger brother—of good conduct, pleasing to behold—glorious, yet
  unmarried, and mighty in prowess; his name is Lakṣmaṇa.
'4': >-
  He is youthful, of pleasing appearance, and desirous of obtaining a wife; and
  he will be a husband suited to you and to your beauty.
'5': >-
  O large-eyed lady, seek him—my brother—as your husband. Then, O fair-limbed
  one, you will be without a rival wife, like Mērumarkaprabha (radiant as a
  golden peak).
'6': >-
  Thus spoken to by Rāma, that rākṣasī, deluded by lust, abruptly abandoning
  Rāma, then spoke to Lakṣmaṇa.
'7': >-
  To your beauty I am a fitting wife—I, a woman of excellent complexion. With me
  you shall roam happily through all the Daṇḍaka forests.
'8': >-
  When thus addressed, Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), skilled in speech, then, smiling at
  Śūrpaṇakhā, replied with words that were proper (to the occasion).
'9': >-
  How do you wish to become the wife of me—a servant—being yourself a female
  servant? For I, O lotus-hued lady, am dependent upon my noble elder brother.
'10': >-
  O large-eyed one of stainless, fair complexion, become the younger wife of my
  noble brother—he who is prosperous, has attained his purpose, and is
  contented.
'11': >-
  Casting off this ugly, unchaste, grim-visaged, pot-bellied old wife, he will
  indeed take delight in you alone.
'12': >-
  For what wise man, O lady of excellent hue, would abandon such surpassing
  beauty as yours, and set his affection upon human women, O fair-hipped one?
'13': >-
  Thus addressed by Lakṣmaṇa, that grim (rākṣasī), pot-bellied one, lacking
  discernment of jest, deemed his words to be true.
'14': >-
  Deluded by desire, she spoke to Rāma—seated in the leaf-hut, the scorcher of
  foes—there together with Sītā, the unassailable.
'15': >-
  Because you cling to this ugly, unchaste, grim, pot-bellied old wife, you do
  not think much of me!
'16': >-
  Today, before your very eyes, I shall devour this human woman; and then I
  shall wander with you, free of any rival, at my pleasure and in comfort.
'17': >-
  Having spoken thus, with eyes like those of a young deer, yet with gaze
  resembling glowing coals, she rushed forward in great wrath—like a great
  blazing meteor falling upon Rohiṇī.
'18': >-
  Seeing her—like a noose of death—rushing upon them, mighty-armed Rāma seized
  her back, and in anger then spoke to Lakṣmaṇa.
'19': >-
  O Saumitri, jesting should never in any way be done with the cruel and the
  ignoble. Behold Vaidehī—this gentle lady—somehow still alive!
'20': >-
  This ugly, unchaste, exceedingly frenzied, big-bellied rākṣasī—O tiger among
  men—you ought to disfigure her.
'21': >-
  Thus commanded, Lakṣmaṇa—angered—before the very eyes of Rāma, drew his sword;
  and that mighty one cut off her ears and nose.
'22': >-
  With her ears and nose cut off, she raised a harsh, discordant cry, and fled
  away as she had come—terrible Śūrpaṇakhā—into the forest.
'23': >-
  Disfigured, exceedingly dreadful, that rākṣasī, drenched in blood, roared with
  many kinds of cries, like a rain-cloud in the season of storms.
'24': >-
  Streaming blood in many ways, fearsome to behold, lifting up her arms and
  roaring, she entered the great forest.
'25': >-
  Then that disfigured one came to Khara—surrounded by a host of
  rākṣasas—dwelling at Jana-sthāna; and approaching that brother of hers, of
  terrible energy, she fell to the ground like a thunderbolt from the sky.
'26': >-
  Thereafter, overcome by fear, delusion, and swoon, she related to Khara—(how)
  Rāghava had come into the forest with his wife and with Lakṣmaṇa; and, herself
  disfigured and bleeding, she reported everything (that had happened).
'27': >-
  Thus ends the eighteenth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the revered, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Disfigurement of
  Śūrpaṇakhā.”
