  Now begins the one-hundred-and-thirtieth Sarga (chapter) of Yuddha-Kāṇḍa in
  the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Meeting with Bharata.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that supremely joyful news, Bharata of true prowess, whose valour was
  ever faithful to righteousness, delightedly commanded Śatrughna, the slayer of
  hostile heroes.
'2': >-
  “Let all the deities and the sacred shrines of the city be worshipped by
  purified men with fragrant garlands and with the sound of musical instruments.
'3': >-
  Let the charioteers, the bards skilled in hymns and ancient lore, and all the
  panegyrists likewise—together with all who are adept with musical instruments,
  and the courtesans in every quarter—go forth.
'4': >-
  Let the royal ladies, the ministers, the troops and the companies of women of
  the army; the brāhmaṇas and the kṣatriyas; the leaders of guilds and the
  assembled corporations—let them all proceed.
'5': >-
  “Let them go out to behold Rāma’s moon-like face.” Thus hearing Bharata’s
  word, Śatrughna, the slayer of hostile heroes, set about the task.
'6': >-
  He set thousands of labourers to work in divisions, saying: “Level the uneven
  places—make the low grounds, the rough spots, and the level stretches all
  even.
'7': >-
  Clear away the foul and filthy places from here onwards, starting from
  Nandigrāma. Sprinkle the whole earth with water chilled like snow.
'8': >-
  Then let others strew everywhere parched grain and flowers. Let the streets of
  that best of cities be adorned with banners raised aloft.
'9': >-
  Let the houses be beautified facing the rising of the sun, with wreaths,
  festoons, loose blossoms, and with gold of five colours.
'10': >-
  Let men in hundreds scatter (perfumed offerings and flowers) along the royal
  road, leaving it unconfined and unobstructed.” Hearing Śatrughna’s command,
  the people rejoiced.
'11': >-
  Dhṛṣṭi, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhārtha the accomplisher of aims, Aśoka,
  Mantrapāla, and Sumantra also—all went forth.
'12': >-
  Some went out with thousands of intoxicated elephants, decorated excellently
  and bearing standards; others with female elephants, their temples adorned
  with golden head-gear.
'13': >-
  Great warriors also went forth in chariots thronged with horses—men with
  lances, spears, and nooses in hand—bearing flags and pennons.
'14': >-
  Surrounded by thousands of horses—chief steeds with other foremost ones—and by
  thousands of foot-soldiers, the heroes marched on.
'15': >-
  Then all the wives of Daśaratha mounted their conveyances and set out, placing
  Kausalyā at the head, and taking Sumitrā also.
'16': All of them, together with Kaikeyī, proceeded to Nandigrāma.
'17': >-
  Bharata, righteous-souled, was surrounded by foremost twice-born, by leaders
  of guilds and citizens; and by ministers holding garlands and sweetmeats in
  their hands.
'18': >-
  He was greeted with the sound of conches and kettle-drums, and by eulogists.
  Skilled in dharma, he took the feet of the noble elders and bowed with his
  head.
'19': >-
  Taking up a pale-white royal umbrella adorned with white garlands, and the
  white yak-tail fans fit for a king and ornamented with gold,
'20': >-
  —Bharata, emaciated by fasting, wretched in appearance, clad in bark-garments
  and black antelope-skin—having earlier heard of his brother’s coming, was
  filled with joy,
'21': >-
  and then the great-souled one went forth to meet Rāma, together with his
  ministers. With the sound of horses’ hooves and the rumble of chariot-wheels,
'22': >-
  with the blare of conches and the beating of drums, the earth seemed to quake;
  and with the trumpeting of elephants too, amid those conch-and-drum
  reverberations,
'23': >-
  the whole town came to Nandigrāma. Seeing (the signs before him), Bharata
  spoke these words to the Wind-god’s son (Hanumān):
'24': >-
  “Surely this fickleness of mind is not being indulged by me like a she-monkey;
  for I do not behold the noble Kākutstha—Rāma, the scorcher of foes.
'25': >-
  Surely those shape-shifting monkeys are not visible either!” When these words
  were spoken, Hanumān replied thus:
'26': >-
  While conveying what was needful to Bharata of true prowess: “Having reached
  trees that ever bear fruit and are in blossom, dripping with honey,
'27': >-
  made resonant with the humming of intoxicated bees by the grace of
  Bharadvāja—O scorcher of foes—there a boon was granted indeed by Vāsava
  (Indra).
'28': >-
  A welcome, endowed with every excellence, was offered to the army. A terrible
  din is heard—the uproar of the forest-dwellers exulting.
'29': >-
  I think that very Vānara host is crossing the river Gomati. Behold the cloud
  of dust rising up, towards the sāla-grove.
'30': >-
  I think the monkeys are swaying and shaking that delightful sāla-wood. And
  there, seen from afar, is the aerial car, moon-like in splendour.
'31': >-
  It is the divine Puṣpaka aerial car, fashioned by Brahmā through thought;
  obtained by the great-souled Rāma after slaying Rāvaṇa together with his
  kinsmen.
'32': >-
  That aerial car, like the young sun in radiance, is Rāma’s conveyance—divine,
  swift as the mind—by the favour of the Lord of Wealth (Kubera).
'33': >-
  In it are the two heroic brothers, the Rāghavas, along with Vaidehī (Sītā);
  and Sugrīva of great splendour; and the rākṣasa Vibhīṣaṇa.
'34': >-
  Then a roar born of joy rose up and seemed to touch the heavens, as women,
  children, youths, and the aged proclaimed, “This is Rāma!”
'35': >-
  Dismounting from chariots, elephants, and horses, the people came to the
  ground and beheld him seated in the aerial car, like the moon in the sky.
'36': >-
  Bharata, with folded palms, exultant, and facing toward Rāghava, then
  worshipped Rāma in due manner with offerings of honour, water for washing the
  feet, and the rest.
'37': >-
  In that aerial car created by Brahmā through thought, Bharata’s elder brother
  shone—broad-eyed and long-eyed—like the god bearing the thunderbolt among the
  immortals.
'38': >-
  Then Bharata, seeing his brother upon the forepart of the aerial car, bowed
  down in reverence to Rāma, like the Sun stationed upon Mount Meru.
'39': >-
  Then, with Rāma’s permission, that unsurpassed aerial car, yoked with swans
  and moving with great speed, descended upon the surface of the earth.
'40': >-
  Bharata of true prowess was lifted into that aerial car. Reaching Rāma and
  rejoicing, he once again bowed to him in salutation.
'41': >-
  Then the Kākutstha, rising to greet him—Bharata who after so long had come
  again within his sight—lifted him onto his lap and embraced him joyfully.
'42': >-
  Then, approaching Lakṣmaṇa and Vaidehī, the scorcher of foes—Bharata—glad at
  heart, paid them reverence and spoke his name.
'43': >-
  Kaikeyī’s son embraced Sugrīva, the bull among monkeys, and then Jāmbavān and
  Aṅgada; and Mainda, Dvivida, Nīla, and also Ṛṣabha.
'44': >-
  And he embraced Suṣeṇa and Nala as well; Gavākṣa and Gandhamādana; Śarabha and
  Panasa too—embracing them all around.
'45': >-
  Those wishful and shape-shifting Vānaras, assuming human forms, then asked
  Bharata of his welfare, rejoicing greatly.
'46': >-
  Then the prince, Bharata—of great splendour, best among the righteous—after
  embracing Sugrīva, the bull among Vānaras, spoke:
'47': >-
  “You are the fifth brother to us four, O Sugrīva. From goodwill friendship
  arises; doing harm is the mark of an enemy.
'48': >-
  And Bharata spoke to Vibhīṣaṇa words of reassurance: “Fortune indeed! With you
  as an ally, a deed most difficult has been accomplished.
'49': >-
  Then Śatrughna, the hero, saluted Rāma together with Lakṣmaṇa; and, out of
  humility, he bowed to Sītā’s feet.
'50': >-
  Rāma approached his mother, pale and worn away by grief; bowing down, he took
  hold of her feet, bringing great gladness to his mother’s heart.
'51': >-
  Having saluted Sumitrā and the illustrious Kaikeyī, he then approached all the
  mothers, and (after that) the family priest.
'52': >-
  With palms joined, all the citizens said to Rāma: “Welcome to you,
  mighty-armed one, increaser of Kausalyā’s joy!”
'53': >-
  Bharata’s elder brother saw those thousands of palms joined and uplifted by
  the townspeople, like lotuses with open blossoms.
'54': >-
  Then Bharata himself took Rāma’s sandals and, knowing dharma, placed them upon
  the king’s feet.
'55': >-
  With folded palms, Bharata then said to Rāma: “This entire kingdom—held by me
  in trust—has been restored to you.
'56': >-
  Today my birth has become fruitful, and my heart’s desire fulfilled, in that I
  behold you, my king, returned again to Ayodhyā.
'57': >-
  Let your lordship inspect the treasury, the storehouses, the household, and
  the army. By your splendour, I have made everything tenfold greater.
'58': >-
  Seeing Bharata speak thus, so devoted to his brother, the Vānaras shed tears,
  and Vibhīṣaṇa the rākṣasa too.
'59': >-
  Then, out of joy, Rāghava placed Bharata upon his lap and, with the army, went
  by that aerial car to Bharata’s hermitage.
'60': >-
  Reaching Bharata’s hermitage, Rāghava, together with the army, alighted from
  the forepart of the aerial car and stood upon the earth.
'61': >-
  Then Rāma spoke to that unsurpassed aerial car: “Go now to the divine
  Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera). I grant leave—depart.”
'62': >-
  Then, permitted by Rāma, that unsurpassed aerial car went forth, turning
  toward the northern quarter, to the abode of the Lord of Wealth.
'63': >-
  The divine Puṣpaka aerial car, which had been seized by the rākṣasa, sped to
  the Lord of Wealth, urged on by Rāma’s command.
'64': >-
  Then the valiant Rāghava—like Śakra, lord of the immortals, with
  Bṛhaspati—pressing the feet of the family priest who was his very soul’s
  friend, sat with him upon a separate auspicious seat.
'65': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-thirtieth Sarga of Yuddha-Kāṇḍa in the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-Kāvya, called “The Meeting with Bharata.”
