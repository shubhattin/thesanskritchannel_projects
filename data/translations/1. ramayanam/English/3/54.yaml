  Now begins the fifty-fourth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Reaching of Laṅkā.”
'1': >-
  But as Vaidehī was being carried away, seeing no one at all as her protector,
  she beheld five foremost of monkeys stationed upon the peaks of a mountain.
'2': >-
  In their midst, that large-eyed lady of fair limbs cast down her upper
  garment—of fine silk, shining with the hue of gold—together with her
  auspicious ornaments.
'3': >-
  That lovely woman released it, thinking, “If they should report this to Rāma,”
  and, casting off the cloth, she dropped it among them along with the
  ornaments.
'4': >-
  But Daśagrīva, through agitation, did not comprehend that deed of hers; while
  the tawny-eyed Rākṣasas, as though with unblinking eyes, kept their gaze fixed
  upon that large-eyed lady.
'5': >-
  Then those best of monkeys saw Sītā crying out aloud; and he—having passed
  beyond Pampā—went facing the city of Laṅkā.
'6': >-
  Taking Maithilī, weeping, the lord of the Rākṣasas proceeded; thus Rāvaṇa,
  exultant, carried her away—his own death embodied.
'7': >-
  As one might bear in the lap a female serpent with sharp fangs and deadly
  venom, so did he carry her through the sky, leaving behind forests, rivers,
  mountains, and lakes.
'8': >-
  He swiftly came upon the ocean, like an arrow loosed from a bow; that abode of
  whales and sea-monsters, the inexhaustible dwelling-place of Varuṇa.
'9': >-
  Reaching the refuge of rivers, he approached the sea, whose waves, in turmoil,
  were heaving, and in which fish and great serpents were thrown into confusion.
'10': >-
  When Vaidehī was being borne away, the ocean—the abode of Varuṇa—became filled
  with voices moving through the mid-air; and then the Cāraṇas sent forth those
  cries.
'11': >-
  “This is the end of Daśagrīva,” so spoke the Siddhas. But Rāvaṇa, taking Sītā
  upon his lap as she struggled and writhed,
'12': >-
  entered the city of Laṅkā—she who was, in truth, death in bodily form for him.
  Having thus come to Laṅkā, the city with its great roads well laid out,
'13': >-
  he entered his inner palace, with its lofty ramparts and abundant defenses.
  There he placed her—the black-eyed lady—overwhelmed with grief and delusion.
'14': >-
  Rāvaṇa set Sītā down, as though she were an asuric illusion wrought by Māyā;
  and Daśagrīva spoke to the rākṣasī women of dreadful appearance:
'15': >-
  “Let no man or woman, unless permitted, behold this Sītā. Give her pearls,
  gems, gold, garments, and ornaments,
'16': >-
  whatever she may desire, just so—according to my will. But whoever speaks to
  Vaidehī any word that is in the least displeasing,
'17': >-
  whether out of ignorance or knowingly—if that one holds her life as not dear—”
  Thus commanding, that powerful lord of the Rākṣasas,
'18': >-
  went out from that inner palace, pondering, “What is to be done?” Then he saw
  eight Rākṣasas of great prowess, flesh-eaters,
'19': >-
  and that mighty one, deluded by the boon he had obtained, seeing them,
  addressed them with these words, praising their strength and valor:
'20': >-
  “Armed with various weapons, go quickly from here with all speed—to
  Janasthāna, that place of slaughter, formerly the dwelling of Khara.
'21': >-
  Take your positions there at Janasthāna, now empty, its Rākṣasas slain;
  relying on your manly prowess and strength, casting fear far away.
'22': >-
  A great and mighty host was stationed at Janasthāna; yet in battle, together
  with Dūṣaṇa and Khara, it was slain by the arrows of Rāma.
'23': >-
  Therefore an unprecedented wrath of mine increases beyond all steadiness; and
  a very great enmity has arisen against Rāma—most dreadful indeed.
'24': >-
  I desire to bring that enmity to completion against that great foe; for I
  shall not obtain sleep until I have slain the enemy in battle.
'25': >-
  Having now slain that Rāma—the slayer of Khara and Dūṣaṇa—I shall attain
  contentment, like a poor man who has gained wealth.
'26': >-
  And you, dwelling at Janasthāna, must keep watch upon Rāma—ascertain truly his
  movements, what exactly he is doing.
'27': >-
  And all you night-rangers must go with vigilance; ever must effort be made,
  always, toward the killing of Rāghava.
'28': >-
  Your strength has been known many times on the forefront of battle; therefore
  it is here at Janasthāna that I have stationed you.
'29': >-
  Then those eight Rākṣasas, having received the meaningful and pleasing
  command, bowed to Rāvaṇa and, leaving Laṅkā together, set out toward
  Janasthāna—of stealthy, unperceived appearance.
'30': >-
  Thus, having obtained Sītā, Rāvaṇa—highly delighted—seized Maithilī; and
  fastening upon Rāma a supreme enmity, that Rāvaṇa, through delusion, became
  glad.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fourth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Reaching of Laṅkā.”
