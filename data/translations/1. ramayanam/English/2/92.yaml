  Now begins the ninety-second chapter of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Leave-taking of Bharadvāja.”
'1': >-
  Then, when that night had passed, Bharata—together with his attendants and all
  his equipment—having duly received hospitality, went again to Bharadvāja, as
  he desired.
'2': >-
  Seeing that tiger among men, Bharata, arrive with joined palms—while he
  (Bharadvāja) had completed his oblations into the sacred fire and his
  Agnihotra—the sage Bharadvāja addressed Bharata.
'3': >-
  “Did the night pass pleasantly for you here in our abode? And is your entire
  following well and at ease? Tell me, O sinless one, regarding the hospitality
  (you have received).”
'4': >-
  Bharata, joining his palms and bowing, replied to the sage of excellent
  splendour, who had come forth from the hermitage.
'5': >-
  “I have dwelt happily here, O Blessed One, together with my full force,
  mounts, and vehicles; and by your might, along with my ministers, I have been
  satisfied with every comfort.”
'6': >-
  “Freed from weariness and distress, with abundant provisions and good
  shelter—taking along even our servants—all of us have indeed dwelt here in
  great ease.”
'7': >-
  “I take leave of you, O Blessed One, O best of sages; since I am setting out
  toward my brother, look upon me with a friendly eye, as I depart.”
'8': >-
  “Tell me of the hermitage of that great-souled one—Rāma—who knows dharma and
  is righteous: which is the way, and how far is it? Declare this to me.”
'9': >-
  Thus questioned, Bharadvāja—of great splendour and great austerities—answered
  Bharata, who longed to see his brother.
'10': >-
  “At two and a half yojanas from here, in a solitary forest, there is the
  mountain Citrakūṭa, lovely, with charming caves and woodlands.”
'11': >-
  “Reaching its northern side is the river Mandākinī, covered with trees laden
  with blossoms, and adorned with delightful, flower-filled groves.”
'12': >-
  “Next to that river is the mountain Citrakūṭa; between those two, dear child,
  there is a leaf-hut—there, those two certainly dwell.”
'13': >-
  “Proceed by the southern route—keeping to the right-hand course—O lord of the
  host. Convey your army, thronged with elephants, horses, and chariots, O
  greatly fortunate one; then you shall behold Rāghava (Rāma).”
'14': >-
  Hearing those words about the departure, the women of the imperial king—though
  worthy of riding in conveyances—abandoned their vehicles and surrounded the
  Brāhmaṇa (the sage).
'15': >-
  Trembling, emaciated, and wretched—together with the queen Sumitrā—Kauśalyā
  there grasped with both her hands the feet of the sage.
'16': >-
  Kaikeyī—censured by all the world for her unfulfilled desire—grasped his feet,
  feeling shame upon her left side (i.e., with downcast embarrassment).
'17': >-
  Having come and circumambulated that Blessed great sage, she then stood nearby
  Bharata himself, her mind dejected.
'18': >-
  Then Bharadvāja, steadfast in vow, asked Bharata: “O Rāghava, I wish to know
  particularly about your mothers.”
'19': >-
  Thus addressed by Bharadvāja, righteous Bharata—skilled in speech—spoke with
  folded hands.
'20': >-
  “This one whom you see, O Blessed One—wretched, wasted by grief and by
  fasting—is indeed the chief queen, the देवी (royal lady) of my father; behold
  her as you would a goddess.”
'21': >-
  “She is Kauśalyā, who gave birth to Rāma—that tiger among men, who walks with
  the stride of a lion—just as Aditi bore Dhātṛ.”
'22': >-
  “And she who stands clasping his left arm, downcast—like a branch of a
  karnikāra tree in the forest with its blossoms fallen—”
'23': >-
  “—to that queen were born two sons, princes with the complexion of the gods:
  both Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna, heroes of true valour.”
'24': >-
  “For her sake, those two tigers among men went, counting their very life as
  nothing; and Daśaratha, bereft of his sons, has gone to heaven.”
'25': >-
  “As for Kaikeyī—called ‘Wrath’ itself, without wisdom, arrogant, deeming
  herself most beautiful, desirous of sovereignty—unworthy in conduct though
  bearing the appearance of nobility—”
'26': >-
  “Know her to be my mother: cruel, resolved upon sin; for I see in her the very
  root of this great calamity that has befallen that great-souled one (Rāma).”
'27': >-
  Having spoken thus, that bull among men, with eyes reddened (from tears), his
  speech choked with sobs, sighed—like an enraged elephant breathing hard in
  anger.
'28': >-
  Bharadvāja, the great ṛṣi, hearing Bharata speaking in that manner, replied—of
  great intellect—with these meaningful words:
'29': >-
  “Kaikeyī should not be regarded as at fault by you, Bharata; for this sending
  forth of Rāma to the forest shall have a happy outcome.”
'30': >-
  “Indeed, from Rāma’s exile here, what will come about shall be for the welfare
  of the gods and the Dānavas, and of the sages of purified selves.”
'31': >-
  Then Bharata, having saluted him, and having circumambulated him, and taking
  leave, urged the army, saying, “Let it be yoked (let the vehicles be made
  ready)!”
'32': >-
  Thereupon, having yoked divine chariots and horses, adorned with gold, many
  people of various kinds, intent on departure, mounted (their vehicles).
'33': >-
  Elephants and young female elephants, with golden girths and bearing banners,
  set forth with loud din—like clouds rising at the end of summer.
'34': >-
  Various other conveyances too—great and small—most precious—went forth; and
  the foot-soldiers marched on foot alone.
'35': >-
  Then the women, led by Kauśalyā, riding in excellent vehicles—desiring the
  sight of Rāma—departed, joyful at that time.
'36': >-
  Bharata, illustrious and furnished with all his attendants, set out, seated in
  an auspicious palanquin appointed for him, shining like the moon, the sun, and
  the youthful dawn.
'37': >-
  That vast army, filled with elephants, horses, and chariots, turned toward the
  southern quarter and advanced, like a great cloud risen up.
'38': >-
  Crossing forests frequented by deer and birds, and along the farther bank of
  the Gaṅgā, and among mountains and rivers as well,
'39': >-
  That army of Bharata—its warriors with horses and with joyous birds (calls)
  all around—frightening flocks of deer and gatherings of birds as it entered
  that great forest—shone resplendent there.
'40': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-second chapter of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the sacred composition of the Ṛṣis, the first epic, entitled
  “The Leave-taking of Bharadvāja.”
