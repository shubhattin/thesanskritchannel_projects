  Now begins the forty-first canto in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Completion of Sagara’s Sacrifice.”
'1': >-
  Knowing that his sons had long since departed (and had not returned), King
  Sagara, O delight of the Raghus, spoke to his grandson Aṁśumān, who was
  radiant with his own splendour:
'2': >-
  “Thou art valiant and accomplished in learning, and in energy thou art equal
  to the forefathers. Seek out the course (and fate) of thy grandsires, and also
  the manner in which the sacrificial horse was carried off.”
'3': >-
  “There are beings that move within the earth—mighty and vast in prowess. For
  warding off their assault, take up thy bow along with thy sword.”
'4': >-
  “Having duly saluted those worthy of reverence, and having slain even those
  who would create impediments, return with thy purpose fulfilled—thou who shalt
  bring my sacrifice to its further shore (to completion).”
'5': >-
  Thus addressed in fitting words by the great-souled Sagara, Aṁśumān—swift in
  valour—took up his bow and sword and set forth.
'6': >-
  Urged on by that king, the best of men entered upon the subterranean path that
  had been dug out by his mighty forefathers.
'7': >-
  There the mighty one beheld a lordly elephant of the quarters, worshipped by
  gods, Dānavas, Rākṣasas, Piśācas, birds, and serpents.
'8': >-
  Circumambulating him in reverence and inquiring after his well-being, he
  questioned him about his forefathers and about the very one who had borne away
  the horse.
'9': >-
  Hearing that, the elephant of the quarters, of great understanding, replied:
  “O Aṁśumān, thou shalt accomplish thy end; with the horse thou shalt return
  quickly.”
'10': >-
  Having heard his words, he proceeded to question all the elephants of the
  quarters—each in due order and in the proper manner.
'11': >-
  And by all those guardians of the directions—skilled in speech and well-versed
  in words—he was honoured and encouraged (with assurance) that he would return
  together with the horse.
'12': >-
  Hearing their words, that swift-in-valour hero went on to the place where his
  forefathers—those sons of Sagara—had been reduced to heaps of ashes.
'13': >-
  Then the son of Asamañjā, overcome by sorrow, cried aloud in utmost anguish,
  deeply afflicted by their destruction.
'14': >-
  And there, not far away, that tiger among men—filled with grief and
  lamentation—saw the sacrificial horse wandering.
'15': >-
  Wishing to perform the water-obsequies for those royal princes, the mighty one
  sought water, but he saw no reservoir of water.
'16': >-
  Casting his keen gaze about, he then beheld the lord of birds—Supaṛṇa—maternal
  uncle of his forefathers, O Rāma, and swift as the wind.
'17': >-
  And that mighty Vainateya spoke to him these words: “Grieve not, O tiger among
  men; this slaying is held to be sanctioned by the world (ordained and
  accepted).”
'18': >-
  “For these mighty ones have been burnt by the immeasurable Kapila. O wise one,
  thou oughtest not to offer them ordinary worldly water.”
'19': >-
  “Gaṅgā, the eldest daughter of Himavat, O bull among men—perform, O
  mighty-armed one, the water-rites for thy forefathers in her.”
'20': >-
  “That purifier of the worlds shall inundate these who have been reduced to
  heaps of ashes. When this ash is wetted by Gaṅgā—the beloved of the
  worlds—those sixty thousand sons shall go to the world of heaven.”
'21': >-
  “Go forth, O fortunate one; gather up the horse, O best of men. O hero, thou
  art worthy to bring the ancestral sacrifice to its completion.”
'22': >-
  Hearing the words of Supaṛṇa, Aṁśumān—of exceeding prowess—quickly took up the
  horse and returned, the great ascetic.
'23': >-
  Then, approaching the king who was under consecration, O delight of the
  Raghus, he reported everything as it had occurred, and likewise the words of
  Supaṛṇa.
'24': >-
  Hearing that dreadful-sounding account from Aṁśumān, the king brought the
  sacrifice to completion, according to the prescribed ordinance and in the
  proper manner.
'25': >-
  The illustrious lord of the earth, having duly completed the sacrifice,
  returned to his own city; yet the king could not arrive at any resolve
  concerning the bringing of Gaṅgā.
'26': >-
  Without reaching a decision, that great king, after a long time, ruled his
  kingdom for thirty thousand years and then went to heaven.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the forty-first canto in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Completion of Sagara’s Sacrifice.”
