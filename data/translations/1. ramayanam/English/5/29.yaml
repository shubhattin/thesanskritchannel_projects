  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-ninth chapter, called “Auspicious Omens.”
'1': >-
  When she had come to such a state—afflicted yet blameless, her former joy
  departed and her mind sunk in dejection—auspicious signs, auspicious indeed,
  attended upon her, like attendants serving a man favored by Fortune.
'2': >-
  Then, for that fair-haired lady, her left eye—black and large, with the lovely
  curve of the lashes as with a swan’s wing—began to throb, like a lotus made
  slightly reddish by the touch of a fish.
'3': >-
  And her left arm too—beautiful, well-rounded, full and firm, worthy of the
  most precious dark aloe-wood and sandal unguents—long unused to the touch of
  her peerless beloved—quickly began to tremble.
'4': >-
  And her left thigh—full, resembling the trunk of a lordly elephant—formed of
  the two well-knit thighs, began again to quiver; and by that throbbing it
  seemed to point out Rāma as standing before her.
'5': >-
  Moreover, her garment—of auspicious hue, like the color of gold, as though
  lightly dust-stained—slipped a little from the fair-limbed lady as she stood,
  like a peak’s crest gently shedding its edge.
'6': >-
  Urged on by these omens and by other signs as well—signs earlier declared by
  holy and accomplished ones—the fair-browed lady rejoiced once more, like a
  seed thought lost, exhausted by wind and sun, springing back to life when the
  rains return.
'7': >-
  Again her face—its lips like a bimba fruit, its eyes, brows, and hairline
  lovely, its lashes gracefully curved—shone forth with teeth white and bright,
  like the moon released from the jaws of Rāhu.
'8': >-
  Freed from sorrow, her weariness dispelled, her fever calmed, her very being
  awakened by joy, the noble lady shone with her bright, fair face like the
  night illumined by the risen moon.
'9': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-ninth chapter, called “Auspicious Omens,” in the
  Sundara-kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
