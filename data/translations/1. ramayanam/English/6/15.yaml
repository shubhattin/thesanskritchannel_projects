  Now, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Yuddha-kanda, the fifteenth sarga,
  named “The Dispute between Indrajit and Vibhishana.”
'1': >-
  Hearing with care the words of Vibhishana—wise in counsel, with an
  understanding equal to that of Brihaspati—then the great-souled Indrajit,
  foremost leader of the Rakshasa hosts, spoke there in reply.
'2': >-
  “What is this, dear uncle, younger one, this speech of yours—so meaningless,
  and as though spoken in excessive fear? In this lineage, whoever has been born
  here—none would ever speak or do anything of this kind.”
'3': >-
  “In courage, in strength, in prowess, in steadfastness, in heroism, and in
  splendor—there is but one man in this lineage who is, as it were, set free
  from them: Vibhishana—yes, uncle, this younger one!”
'4': >-
  “What indeed are those two sons of a human king to us—when even by a single
  Rakshasa among us, though of ordinary make, it is possible to slay them? How
  then do you, being timid, seek to frighten us about them?”
'5': >-
  “The lord of the three worlds, the king of the gods—Shakra himself—was made by
  me to sit down upon the surface of the earth. Even the quarters were given
  over to fear, and all the hosts of the gods, entire, were then driven to
  terror.”
'6': >-
  “His Airavata, trumpeting loudly, was struck down by me upon the ground. And
  forcibly dragging out its tusks, I put all the companies of the gods to flight
  in utter panic.”
'7': >-
  “I—who am a breaker of the pride even of the gods, and a maker of grief even
  for the best of the Daityas—how should I not be able, with my great valor, to
  vanquish the sons of a human king—mere men of common nature?”
'8': >-
  Then Vibhishana, the foremost of those who bear weapons, hearing that speech
  of Indrajit—Indra-like, unapproachable, and of mighty energy—spoke words of
  great import.
'9': >-
  “Dear one, there is no settled judgment in your counsel; you are still a boy,
  your understanding not yet mature. Therefore you have spoken many purposeless
  words—mere babbling—leading only to your own destruction.”
'10': >-
  “By being called Ravana’s son, Indrajit, you are an enemy in the guise of a
  friend. For, on hearing of the destruction of Raghava in such terms, you
  approve it out of delusion.”
'11': >-
  “You yourself are to be slain, and you are of thoroughly perverse mind; and he
  too is to be slain who brought you here—who today, a mere boy yet obstinate
  and rash, led you into the presence of those skilled in counsel.”
'12': >-
  “Deluded, immature, given to insolence, sharp by nature, of small
  understanding, and evil-souled—foolish and exceedingly ill-advised—you speak
  thus, Indrajit, because of your very childishness.”
'13': >-
  “Who could endure the arrows of Raghava, released in battle at close
  range—shining like the rod of Brahma, blazing with radiance, bearing the
  semblance of Time itself, and comparable to Yama’s staff?”
'14': >-
  “Let us present to Rama the lady Sita, together with wealth, jewels, fine
  ornaments, divine garments, and wondrous gems; and then, O king, let us dwell
  here free from sorrow.”
'15': >-
  Thus ends the fifteenth sarga of the Yuddha-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the primal epic, entitled “The Dispute between Indrajit and
  Vibhishana.”
