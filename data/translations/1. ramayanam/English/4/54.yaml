  Now begins the fifty-fourth canto, named “Hanuman’s Sowing of Dissension
  (Hanūmad-bhedanam)”, in the Kishkindhā Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  When Tārā—radiant with the splendour of the lord of stars (the moon)—spoke
  thus, then Hanumān regarded that kingdom as having been, by that (course),
  taken away from Vāli’s son Aṅgada.
'2': >-
  Hanumān deemed Vāli’s son to be endowed with eightfold counsel (well-fashioned
  wisdom), furnished with the four military forces, and possessed of
  fourteenfold excellence (manifold virtues and qualifications).
'3': >-
  He saw him as ever filling out and increasing through brilliance, strength,
  and valour—like the moon, waxing in prosperity at the beginning of the bright
  fortnight.
'4': >-
  He beheld him equal to Bṛhaspati in understanding, in prowess resembling his
  father, and attending upon Tārā—like Purandara (Indra) serving Śukra (his
  preceptor) in obedience and reverence.
'5': >-
  Then Hanumān, who was weary for the sake of his lord and who was well versed
  in all the treatises, set about to bring Aṅgada over to his purpose (to win
  him to a decision).
'6': >-
  Expounding the third among the four means (of statecraft), Hanumān, by the
  wealth of his speech, set about creating division among all those Vānara
  chiefs.
'7': >-
  When all of them had thus been divided, then he sought to intimidate Aṅgada
  with dreadful and varied words, joined to the stratagem of provoking anger.
'8': >-
  “You are surely more capable than your father in battle, O son of Tārā. You
  are firmly able to uphold the monkey-kingdom just as your father did.”
'9': >-
  “For monkeys are ever fickle-minded, O foremost of the Vānaras; they will not
  endure to be commanded by you—deprived of son and wife.”
'10': >-
  “These will not truly be devoted to you—I tell you plainly—such as this
  Jāmbavān, Nīla, and Suhotra, the mighty monkey.”
'11': >-
  “Indeed, I say that by the qualities of conciliation and gifts and the like,
  these all cannot be drawn away by you from Sugrīva; nor can it be done by
  force (punishment).”
'12': >-
  “Even the seizing of a seat (of sovereignty) is spoken of as being done by the
  stronger against the weak; therefore, let not a weak one enter into
  conflict—for conflict is but self-destruction for him.”
'13': >-
  “And this which you take to be a sure refuge—heard of as this cave—this is but
  a slight work of piercing for the arrows of Lakṣmaṇa.”
'14': >-
  “Of old, Indra did but a little by casting his thunderbolt; Lakṣmaṇa, with his
  sharp arrows, would split (this) as one splits a leaf-packet.”
'15': >-
  “And Lakṣmaṇa has many steel shafts of that very kind—whose touch is like the
  thunderbolt, and which can rend even mountains.”
'16': >-
  “At the very moment you sit down here (remain to make your stand), O scorcher
  of foes, at that very moment all the Vānaras—having formed their resolve—will
  abandon you.”
'17': >-
  “Remembering their sons and wives, ever anxious and hungry, worn out and
  afflicted by beds of misery, they will make you ‘their rear’—they will turn
  their backs on you.”
'18': >-
  “Then you, bereft of friends and of kinsmen who seek your good, will become
  exceedingly fearful—even of a trembling blade of grass.”
'19': >-
  “And those terrible arrows of Lakṣmaṇa—swift, irresistible, and hard to
  withstand—will never refrain from harming you, seeking to slay you when you
  have turned away (in retreat).”
'20': >-
  “But as for us, we have gone along with you and have approached you in a
  disciplined and respectful manner; and then Sugrīva, in due order, will
  establish you in the kingdom.”
'21': >-
  “Your paternal uncle is a king of righteousness, desirous of goodwill, firm in
  vow, pure, and true to his promise; he would never bring you to ruin.”
'22': >-
  “Moreover, he seeks what is dear to your mother, and his very life is for that
  purpose; and he has no other offspring besides you—therefore, O Aṅgada, let
  this course be taken (let us go).”
'23': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fourth canto, named “Hanuman’s Sowing of Dissension
  (Hanūmad-bhedanam)”, in the Kishkindhā Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primordial epic.
