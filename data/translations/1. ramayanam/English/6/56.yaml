  Now begins the fifty-sixth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Slaying of Akampana.”
'1': >-
  Beholding that exceedingly mighty deed accomplished by the foremost of the
  Vānara warriors, Akampana in the midst of battle was seized with fierce wrath.
'2': >-
  Overpowered by a swoon of anger, and shaking his excellent bow, he, seeing the
  exploit of the enemies, spoke these words to his charioteer:
'3': >-
  “Quickly, charioteer, bring the chariot right there at once; these powerful
  ones are slaying very many Rākṣasas in the fight.
'4': >-
  “These Vānaras are indeed mighty and terrible in their rage, wielding trees
  and rocks as weapons; they stand facing me in the forefront.
'5': >-
  “I desire to slay them, for I am one who glories in battle; by them the entire
  strength of the Rākṣasas is seen to be crushed.”
'6': >-
  Then Akampana, foremost among chariot-warriors, in a chariot whose horses were
  set in motion, rushed upon the monkeys from afar with a net of arrows.
'7': >-
  The Vānara hosts were not able to stand—how much less to fight in the
  encounter; broken by Akampana’s shafts, they all fled headlong.
'8': >-
  Seeing those kinsmen, fallen under the sway of Death and pursued by Akampana’s
  arrows, mighty Hanumān went to their aid.
'9': >-
  Seeing that great monkey, all those bull-like leaders of the monkeys—heroes in
  battle—came together, rejoicing, and surrounded him.
'10': >-
  When the foremost of the monkeys beheld Hanumān standing firm, they became
  strong, taking refuge in one who was strong.
'11': >-
  But Akampana, seeing Hanumān stationed like a mountain, rained upon him
  arrows, even as Mahendra showers torrents of rain.
'12': >-
  Without giving thought to the multitude of arrows that had struck his body,
  the mighty monkey set his mind upon the slaying of Akampana.
'13': >-
  Then the glorious Hanumān, son of the Wind-god, laughing aloud, charged at
  that Rākṣasa, as though shaking the very earth.
'14': >-
  And as he roared and blazed with splendour, his form became unassailable—like
  fire when it is fiercely aflame.
'15': >-
  Knowing himself to be not vulnerable to weapons, and filled with wrath, the
  leader among monkeys tore up a rock with great speed.
'16': >-
  Grasping that huge rock with one hand, the mighty Māruti, raising a great
  roar, whirled it about.
'17': >-
  Then he rushed upon Akampana, lord of the Rākṣasas—like Purandara of old
  charging in battle upon Namuci with his thunderbolt.
'18': >-
  Akampana, seeing that mountain-peak lifted up, from afar cleft it with great
  arrows shaped like half-moons.
'19': >-
  Seeing that mountain-top, split by the Rākṣasa’s arrows, scattered and fallen
  from the sky, Hanumān was overwhelmed by a surge of anger.
'20': >-
  Then the monkey, possessed of wrath and pride, coming upon an aśvakarṇa tree,
  swiftly tore it up—lofty like a mighty mountain.
'21': >-
  Seizing that aśvakarṇa with its huge trunk, the radiant hero, grasping it with
  exceeding delight, whirled it about in the battle.
'22': >-
  Running with tremendous speed, and exceedingly enraged, Hanumān shattered
  trees in his impetuosity, tearing up the earth with his feet.
'23': >-
  The wise Hanumān struck down elephants with their riders, chariots with their
  chariot-warriors, and also Rākṣasas fighting on foot.
'24': >-
  Seeing Hanumān—like Death himself when enraged—bearing a tree and taking away
  life, the Rākṣasas fled in dismay.
'25': >-
  Akampana, the hero, saw him rushing in, wrathful and dreadful to the Rākṣasas;
  and he was agitated, and he roared aloud.
'26': >-
  And with fourteen sharp arrows, rending the body, Akampana pierced that
  mighty-spirited Hanumān.
'27': >-
  Thus strewn with steel shafts—sharp, spear-like arrows—Hanumān the hero
  appeared like a mountain bristling with peaks.
'28': >-
  That great-armed, great-bodied, great-strong hero shone forth—resembling a
  blossoming aśoka tree, or like smokeless fire.
'29': >-
  Then tearing up another tree, gathering unsurpassed momentum, he swiftly
  struck Akampana, lord of the Rākṣasas, upon the head.
'30': >-
  Struck by that tree by the great-souled Vānara lord, the Rākṣasa fell and
  died.
'31': >-
  Seeing Akampana, lord of the Rākṣasas, slain upon the ground, all the Rākṣasas
  were shaken—like trees in an earthquake.
'32': >-
  Casting away their weapons, all those defeated Rākṣasas ran toward Laṅkā in
  terror, being chased by those Vānara warriors.
'33': >-
  With hair dishevelled, bewildered, their pride broken, defeated, they ran,
  their limbs streaming with drops of sweat-water from fear.
'34': >-
  Jostling one another, they entered the city in fear; and behind them,
  confused, they kept looking back again and again.
'35': >-
  When those Rākṣasas had entered Laṅkā, all the mighty monkeys assembled
  together and honoured Hanumān.
'36': >-
  He too, exalted in spirit and endowed with valour, honoured all those monkeys
  in return, duly and graciously, according to what was fitting.
'37': >-
  Then the monkeys, their desire for conquest fulfilled, roared with all their
  strength; and there again they dragged living Rākṣasas (as captives) in their
  hands.
'38': >-
  Having come together and slain the Rākṣasas, Māruti, the great monkey,
  attained the splendour of a hero—like Viṣṇu in the forefront of an army,
  destroying foes and overthrowing a mighty and dreadful Asura by vast strength.
'39': >-
  The hosts of the gods honoured that monkey; and so too did Rāma himself, and
  the exceedingly mighty Lakṣmaṇa; likewise the monkeys headed by Sugrīva, and
  Vibhīṣaṇa also, mighty in prowess, at that time.
'40': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-sixth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Slaying of Akampana.”
