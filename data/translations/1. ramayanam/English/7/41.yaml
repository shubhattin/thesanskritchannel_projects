  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-first chapter, called “The Renewed Permission (and Dismissal) of
  Puṣpaka.”
'1': >-
  Having dismissed the bears, the monkeys, and the rākṣasas, the great-armed
  Rāma, together with his brothers, rejoiced greatly, being himself happy and
  content.
'2': >-
  Then, at the time of the latter part of the day, Rāghava, along with his
  brothers, heard a sweet voice spoken from the sky.
'3': >-
  “O gentle Rāma, look upon me with a gentle countenance. Know me, O lord, to be
  Puṣpaka, come from Kubera’s abode.”
'4': >-
  “Knowing your command, I went to Kubera’s dwelling in order to attend upon
  him, O best of men; and he spoke to me in reply.”
'5': >-
  “You have been conquered by the great-souled Rāghava, lord among men, after he
  slew in battle the hard-to-assail Rāvaṇa, sovereign of the rākṣasas.”
'6': >-
  “In that wicked one’s being slain—Rāvaṇa together with his host, with his sons
  and with his kinsmen—I too have felt the highest joy.”
'7': >-
  “Therefore, O gentle one, you who were overcome by Rāma—the Supreme Soul—in
  Laṅkā: bear that very Rāma; this is what I command you.”
'8': >-
  “For this is my greatest desire—that you should carry Rāghava’s son (Rāma),
  the resort of the world. Go forth, free from all feverish distress.”
'9': >-
  “Thus, having understood the command of the magnanimous Lord of Wealth
  (Kubera), I have come into your presence without fear. Await me.”
'10': >-
  “By the command of the Lord of Wealth, I move about unseen by all beings—by my
  power—while faithfully observing your order.”
'11': >-
  Thus addressed, the mighty-armed, exceedingly powerful Rāma, seeing
  Puṣpaka—the aerial car—returned again, spoke to it.
'12': >-
  “If it is so, then welcome to you, O excellent aerial car, Puṣpaka. Through
  the favor of the Lord of Wealth, may there be no fault in our conduct (in
  relation to you).”
'13': >-
  Then the great-armed Rāghava honored Puṣpaka with parched grains, with
  flowers, and with fragrant incense.
'14': >-
  And he said, “Go, then; and come when I remember you. O gentle one, in the
  path of the Siddhas, do not be joined to sorrow. And may there be no
  obstruction to you as you go, at your pleasure, to whatever quarter you
  desire.”
'15': >-
  “So be it,” said Puṣpaka; and having been honored by Rāma and dismissed, it
  then departed from there in the direction it desired.
'16': >-
  When that virtuous Puṣpaka had thus vanished, Bharata, with joined palms,
  spoke these words to Raghunandana (Rāma).
'17': >-
  “O hero, while you rule, diverse utterances of beings that are not human are
  repeatedly seen (and heard) in regard to you.”
'18': >-
  “This full month has passed in the wellbeing of creatures; even for beings who
  are aged, death does not come, O Rāghava.”
'19': >-
  “Women give birth without illness, and men are indeed possessed of splendid
  bodies; and the joy of the people dwelling in the city is greatly increased, O
  king.”
'20': >-
  “In due season the rain-cloud pours down nectar-like water; and these winds
  too blow—pleasant, auspicious, and delightful to the touch.”
'21': >-
  “In the city, O king, the townsmen and the people of the countryside alike
  declare: ‘Such is a king, undecaying and imperishable, as a lord of men should
  be.’”
'22': >-
  Hearing these exceedingly sweet words spoken by Bharata, Rāma—best of
  kings—was filled with joy.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the forty-first chapter of the Uttarakāṇḍa of the sacred
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “The Renewed Permission (and
  Dismissal) of Puṣpaka.”
