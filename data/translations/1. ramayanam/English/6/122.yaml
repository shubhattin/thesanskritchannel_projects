  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-twenty-second sarga, called “Daśaratha’s Instruction and
  Admonition.”
'1': >-
  Hearing these auspicious words spoken by Rāghava, Maheśvara (the Great Lord)
  then uttered words still more auspicious.
'2': >-
  “O Puṣkarākṣa (lotus-eyed one), O mighty-armed, broad-chested hero, O scorcher
  of foes, fortunate indeed is this deed accomplished by you, O best of the
  uphold­ers of dharma.
'3': >-
  “Fortunate indeed that the dreadful darkness which had grown over all the
  worlds has been turned back by you in battle; and, O Rāma, the fear born of
  Rāvaṇa has been dispelled.
'4': >-
  “After comforting despondent Bharata, and illustrious Kauśalyā, and also
  Kaikeyī and Sumitrā—Lakṣmaṇa’s mother—having seen them all,
'5': >-
  “and, having obtained the kingship in Ayodhyā and gladdened your circle of
  well-wishers, O great-armed one, and having firmly established the lineage of
  the Ikṣvākus in its noble line,
'6': >-
  “and having performed the Aśvamedha (horse-sacrifice) and attained unsurpassed
  renown, and having bestowed wealth upon brāhmaṇas, you are worthy to go to the
  threefold heaven.”
'7': >-
  “This king Daśaratha—your father—stands in a celestial aerial car. O scion of
  Kakutstha, in the human world he was your venerable preceptor, of great fame.
'8': >-
  “That splendid one has gone to Indra’s world, and through you—his son—has been
  delivered. Together with your brother Lakṣmaṇa, pay him homage.”
'9': >-
  Hearing Mahādeva’s words, Rāghava, together with Lakṣmaṇa, bowed in reverence
  to his father who stood upon the summit of the aerial car.
'10': >-
  The Lord beheld his father—radiant with his own splendor, free from all taint,
  clad in celestial raiment—together with his brother Lakṣmaṇa.
'11': >-
  Then Daśaratha, the lord of the earth, stationed in the aerial car, was filled
  with exceeding joy on seeing his son, dearer to him than life itself.
'12': >-
  That mighty-armed king, seated upon a noble throne, drew him onto his lap,
  embraced him with both arms, and then began to speak.
'13': >-
  “To me, bereft of you, O Rāma, even heaven has not seemed of much worth, nor
  the honors paid by the foremost of gods. This is the truth I declare to you.
'14': >-
  “Today, beholding you with your foes slain, your heart wholly fulfilled, and
  your forest-dwelling brought to its end, supreme joy has arisen in me.
'15': >-
  “The words that Kaikeyī spoke—O best among speakers—meant to bring about your
  banishment, have remained fixed within my heart.
'16': >-
  “But today, seeing you safe and well, and embracing you together with
  Lakṣmaṇa, I am freed from sorrow—like the sun freed from mist.”
'17': >-
  “I have been saved by you, my son—by you, that great-souled and truly worthy
  son—just as the righteous brāhmaṇa Kahola was saved by Aṣṭāvakra.”
'18': >-
  “And now I understand, O gentle one, how it was ordained by the lords of the
  gods that the Supreme Person should be established here for the slaying of
  Rāvaṇa.”
'19': >-
  “Surely fulfilled in purpose is Kauśalyā: she will behold you, O Rāma,
  returned home from the forest, rejoicing, O destroyer of foes.
'20': >-
  “Surely fulfilled in purpose are those men, O Rāma, who will behold you enter
  the city and also see you consecrated in sovereignty as lord of the earth.”
'21': >-
  “I desire to behold you united with Bharata—he who is devoted, mighty, pure,
  and a practiser of dharma.”
'22': >-
  “Fourteen years, O gentle one, were spent by you in the forest, dwelling
  together with Sītā, and with Lakṣmaṇa—out of affection for me.
'23': >-
  “Your forest-dwelling has come to an end; your vow has been fulfilled by you;
  and, having slain Rāvaṇa in battle, you have satisfied the gods.”
'24': >-
  “A deed has been accomplished—praiseworthy and fame-bestowing—and you have
  attained it, O subduer of foes. Established in the kingdom together with your
  brothers, attain long life.”
'25': >-
  As the king spoke thus, Rāma, with hands joined in reverence, replied: “Show
  your favor, O knower of dharma, toward Kaikeyī and toward Bharata.”
'26': >-
  “The curse that you uttered to Kaikeyī—‘I abandon you together with your
  son’—may that dreadful curse not touch Kaikeyī together with her son, O Lord.”
'27': >-
  “So be it,” said that great king to Rāma who stood with folded hands; and,
  embracing Lakṣmaṇa also, he spoke again.
'28': >-
  “By serving Rāma with devotion, together with Vaidehī Sītā, you have given me
  very great delight; and you have also attained the fruit of dharma.
'29': >-
  “O knower of dharma, you shall attain dharma and abundant fame upon the earth;
  and when Rāma is pleased, you shall attain heaven and likewise the highest
  glory.”
'30': >-
  “Serve Rāma—good be to you, O increaser of Sumitrā’s joy. Rāma is ever engaged
  in what is beneficial for all the worlds.”
'31': >-
  “These three worlds together with Indra, and the Siddhas, and the supreme
  ṛṣis—having saluted the great-souled one—honor the Supreme Person.”
'32': >-
  “This is that imperishable Brahman, beyond full manifestation, comparable to
  Brahman itself—O gentle one—the very heart of the gods, the secret: Rāma, the
  scorcher of foes.”
'33': >-
  “Through you, who were intent on service—together with Vaidehī Sītā—dharma has
  been attained and abundant fame as well.”
'34': >-
  Having thus addressed Lakṣmaṇa, the king then spoke gently to his
  daughter-in-law, who stood with hands clasped in reverence, calling her
  “daughter,” and he spoke to her softly, little by little.
'35': >-
  “O Vaidehī, you should not harbor anger regarding this act of abandonment.
  This was done by Rāma for the sake of purification, with your welfare in view.
'36': >-
  “This, my daughter, is exceedingly difficult—the mark of your conduct and
  character; for what you have done will indeed surpass the fame of other women.
'37': >-
  “You must not be wholly intent only upon satisfying your own wish in the
  matter of serving your husband; yet I must certainly say this to you: he is
  your supreme divinity.”
'38': >-
  Thus, after instructing and admonishing his two sons and Sītā, King Daśaratha
  went to Indra’s world in the aerial car.
'39': >-
  Mounting the aerial car, that great-souled best of kings—his body thrilled
  with delight and splendor—having taken leave of his two sons together with
  Sītā, went to the world of the foremost of the gods.
'40': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa,
  the one-hundred-and-twenty-second sarga, called “Daśaratha’s Instruction and
  Admonition.”
