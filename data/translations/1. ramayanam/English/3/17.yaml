  Now, in the blessed Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the seventeenth
  canto, called “The Disclosure of Śūrpaṇakhā’s Intent.”
'1': >-
  But Rāma, having performed his rite of consecration, together with Sītā and
  Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), then set out from the bank of the Godāvarī and went
  thence to their own hermitage.
'2': >-
  Having approached that hermitage, Rāghava, along with Lakṣmaṇa, performed the
  forenoon observances, and then entered the leaf-thatched hut.
'3': >-
  He dwelt there contentedly, being honored by the great sages; and that Rāma,
  seated in the leaf-hut together with Sītā, remained at ease.
'4': >-
  The mighty-armed one shone there like the moon amid variegated clouds; and
  along with his brother Lakṣmaṇa he engaged in diverse conversation.
'5': >-
  While Rāma sat thus, his mind absorbed in discourse, a certain rākṣasī came by
  chance into that region.
'6': >-
  She was named Śūrpaṇakhā, sister of the rākṣasa Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa); coming
  upon Rāma, she beheld him, as it were, like a god.
'7': >-
  She saw him with a radiant countenance, mighty-armed, lotus-petal-eyed; with
  the gait of an elephant in his stride, bearing a circle of matted locks.
'8': >-
  She saw Rāma—tender yet of great spirit, endowed with the marks of
  sovereignty; dark as a blue lotus, with splendor like Kāma (the god of love).
'9': >-
  On beholding him, equal to Indra, the rākṣasī, deluded by desire, was overcome
  by passion—she, ill-featured, gazing on Rāma of fair countenance; she,
  pot-bellied, seeing him slender-waisted.
'10': >-
  She, wide-eyed though misshapen-eyed; he, with beautiful hair, while she had
  coppery locks; she, ugly, looking upon him of pleasing form; he, sweet-voiced,
  while her voice was dreadful.
'11': >-
  He, youthful, while she was fierce and aged; he, gracious, while she spoke
  harshly and perversely; he, upright in conduct, while she was utterly
  ill-conducted; he, pleasing to behold, while she was unpleasant to see.
'12': >-
  That rākṣasī, seized by bodily passion, spoke to Rāma: “Though matted-haired
  and clad in ascetic guise, you bear your wife with you, and you carry bow and
  arrows.”
'13': >-
  “How have you come into this region, frequented by rākṣasas? What is the
  purpose of your coming? You ought to tell me the truth of it.”
'14': >-
  Thus addressed by the rākṣasī Śūrpaṇakhā, the scorcher of foes, with his
  straightforward understanding, began to relate everything.
'15': >-
  “There was a king named Daśaratha, possessing prowess like that of the gods.
  Of him I am the eldest son, known among men by the name Rāma.”
'16': >-
  “This is my younger brother named Lakṣmaṇa, devotedly following me. And this
  is my wife, the princess of Videha, famed as Sītā.”
'17': >-
  “By the command of the lord of men—constrained by my father and mother—and
  desiring dharma, I have come here to dwell in the forest for the sake of
  dharma.”
'18': >-
  “But I wish to know you: whose are you, and who are you, or to whom do you
  belong? For you appear to me to be a rākṣasī, though with limbs that are, for
  the moment, pleasing.”
'19': >-
  “Or for what reason have you come here? Tell me the truth.” Hearing his words,
  the rākṣasī, tormented by love, spoke.
'20': >-
  “Listen, Rāma, to the true matter; I shall speak my words. I am the rākṣasī
  named Śūrpaṇakhā, able to assume forms at will.”
'21': >-
  “I roam this forest alone, dreadful to all. I have a brother named Rāvaṇa—if
  his name has reached your ears.”
'22': >-
  “A hero, the son of Viśravas—if his fame has reached your ears. And there is
  Kumbhakarṇa, of great might, ever sunk in deep sleep.”
'23': >-
  “And Vibhīṣaṇa is righteous-souled and does not follow rākṣasa ways. And there
  are also my two brothers, Khara and Dūṣaṇa, renowned for valor in battle.”
'24': >-
  “Passing over them all, O Rāma, since I beheld you—never seen before—I have
  come to you in earnest feeling, as to my husband, O best of men.”
'25': >-
  “I am endowed with power, moving with unrestricted strength at will. Be my
  husband for a long time; what will you do with Sītā?”
'26': >-
  “She is deformed and ugly; she is not fit to match you. I alone am suited to
  you—look upon me as the one fit to be your wife.”
'27': >-
  “This ill-conducted human woman—ugly, hideous, and with a sunken belly—I shall
  devour her, along with your brother, before your very eyes.”
'28': >-
  “Then, as a lover, beholding mountain-peaks and forests of many kinds together
  with me, you shall wander through the Daṇḍakas.”
'29': >-
  Thus addressed, the son of Kakutstha, laughing at the intoxicated-eyed woman,
  began to speak these words—he who was skilled in speech.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the seventeenth canto in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, named “The Disclosure of Śūrpaṇakhā’s Intent.”
