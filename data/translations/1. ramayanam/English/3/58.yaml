  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-eighth chapter, named “The Perception of Ill Omens
  (Animiitta-darśanam).”
'1': >-
  Seeing Lakṣmaṇa dejected, and finding the place empty, righteous-souled Rāma,
  son of Daśaratha, questioned him, not seeing Vaidehī there.
'2': >-
  “She who set forth with me into the Daṇḍaka forest and followed me—where is
  that Vaidehī, O Lakṣmaṇa? Leaving her behind, how have you come here?”
'3': >-
  “Where is that slender-waisted Vaidehī, my companion in sorrow, while I—fallen
  from my kingdom, wretched—wander about the Daṇḍaka woods?”
'4': >-
  “Without her, O hero, I am not able to live even for a moment. Where is Sītā,
  like unto the daughter of the gods, my helper as life-breath itself?”
'5': >-
  “Even the lordship of the immortals, and even the sovereignty of the earth, O
  Lakṣmaṇa, would I not desire without that daughter of Janaka, radiant like
  molten gold.”
'6': >-
  “Does Vaidehī yet live—she who is dearer to me than my very life-breaths? Will
  not this exile of mine, O hero, prove vain and false?”
'7': >-
  “If I have died on account of Sītā, and you have gone hence (after me), will
  Kaikeyī then attain her desire and live happily?”
'8': >-
  “Will Kausalyā—ascetic in her grief, her son dead, yet with her purpose
  fulfilled in the kingdom for her son—will she, in gentleness, attend upon
  Kaikeyī?”
'9': >-
  “If Vaidehī lives, I shall go back again to the hermitage. But if she has met
  with calamity, I shall cast away my life-breaths, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'10': >-
  “If, when I return to the hermitage, Vaidehī does not speak to me—Sītā who
  used to smile before me—then I shall perish, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'11': >-
  “Tell me, Lakṣmaṇa, whether Vaidehī lives or not—whether, while you were
  careless, that hermit-lady has been devoured by the rākṣasas.”
'12': >-
  “Delicate, and youthful, and ever one who had no share in sorrow—Vaidehī,
  separated from me, surely grieves, her mind distressed.”
'13': >-
  “In every way, fear was produced even in you by that crooked, utterly wicked
  rākṣasa, who cried aloud, ‘O Lakṣmaṇa!’”
'14': >-
  “And I think that voice—so like my own—was heard by Vaidehī; and you, sent by
  her in terror, have come quickly here to see me.”
'15': >-
  “Truly, grievous harm has been done by leaving Sītā alone in the forest,
  granting an opening to the merciless rākṣasas to strike.”
'16': >-
  “The flesh-eating rākṣasas, distressed by the slaying of Khara, will surely
  cause Sītā to be slain by those dreadful ones—of this there is no doubt.”
'17': >-
  “Alas! I am sunk in calamity in every way, O destroyer of foes. What shall I
  do now? I fear that such a fate was destined to befall.”
'18': >-
  Thus thinking of Sītā of noble hips, Rāghava came in haste to Jana-sthāna
  together with Lakṣmaṇa.
'19': >-
  Censuring his younger brother, whose form was stricken with distress from
  hunger, fatigue, and thirst, Rāma sighed deeply—his mouth parched, his heart
  despondent—and, reaching the shelter, he beheld it empty.
'20': >-
  That hero entered his own hermitage and, following after certain places of
  their accustomed wanderings, when he came upon the ground of their dwelling,
  he became—crying, as it were, “This is it, this indeed is it!”—with bristling
  hairs (from agitation), yet afflicted with anguish.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-eighth chapter, named “The Perception of Ill Omens
  (Animiitta-darśanam),” in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the primeval epic.
