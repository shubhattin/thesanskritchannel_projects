  Now begins, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, the
  thirty-sixth canto, called “The Greatness of Umā.”
'1': >-
  When that sage had thus spoken, the two heroic sons of Raghu—Rāma and
  Lakṣmaṇa—having expressed their approval of the narrative, addressed that
  foremost of ascetics.
'2': >-
  “O Brāhmaṇ, this highest and righteous account has been related by you. You
  ought to tell us, in full detail, of the eldest daughter of the lord of
  mountains—indeed you are one who knows the expanse in its expanse—(and) of the
  divine and human course of events (concerning her).”
'3': >-
  “For what reason did the purifier of the worlds cause (herself) to flow in
  three paths? How did Gaṅgā, famed as the river that moves in three courses,
  become renowned as the foremost of streams?”
'4': >-
  When the Kakutstha thus spoke, then Viśvāmitra, the knower of dharma and rich
  in austerities, (began to speak).
'5': >-
  In the midst of the sages he related the entire account in full: “Formerly, O
  Rāma, the great ascetic Śitikaṇṭha (Śiva) had entered into wedlock.
'6': >-
  And the Blessed Lord, beholding the Goddess, set about union (with her). While
  that wise Mahādeva—Śitikaṇṭha, the divine one—was sporting (with her), a full
  hundred divine years passed.
'7': >-
  Yet, O Rāma, no son was born to him of her, O scorcher of foes. Then all the
  gods, with the Grandfather (Brahmā) at their head, became intent (upon
  intervention).
'8': >-
  “Whatever being may be born here—who could endure it?” Thus thinking, all the
  gods approached, and bowing low, spoke these words:
'9': >-
  “O God of gods, O Mahādeva, you who delight in the welfare of this world—be
  pleased to show favor, in response to the obeisance of the gods.
'10': >-
  “The worlds will not be able to bear your fiery energy, O best of the gods.
  Endowed with Brahmā’s austerity, practice tapas together with the Goddess.”
'11': >-
  “For the sake of the welfare of the three worlds, restrain your energy within
  your own energy. Protect all these worlds; do not make them worldless (by
  consuming them).”
'12': >-
  Hearing the words of the deities, the Great Lord of all the worlds said to
  them all, “So be it,” and again he spoke this (further):
'13': >-
  “I shall restrain my energy along with Umā, even as energy (is held) within
  energy. May the gods and the earth indeed attain peace (and relief).”
'14': >-
  “But this unsurpassed energy of mine, stirred up from its place—who will bear
  it? Let the best of the gods tell me.”
'15': >-
  Thus addressed, the gods replied to the Bull-bannered Lord (Śiva): “That
  energy which has been stirred up today—Dhara (the Earth) will bear it.”
'16': >-
  Thus spoken to, the mighty Lord of the gods released it—by that energy the
  earth, together with her mountains and forests, was pervaded.
'17': >-
  Then the gods again spoke also to Hutaśana (Agni): “Enter into it, O greatly
  radiant one—(enter) that Rudra-like energy, accompanied by the wind.”
'18': >-
  Then, pervaded once more by Agni, there came into being the White Mountain;
  and also a divine reed-bed (Śaravaṇa), radiant like fire and the sun.
'19': >-
  There was born the greatly radiant Kārtikeya, sprung from Agni. Then, at that
  time, the gods together with the hosts of sages honored Umā and Śiva.
'20': >-
  They worshiped them exceedingly, their minds then full of delight. Thereupon
  the daughter of the mountain, O Rāma, spoke these words to the gods:
'21': >-
  In anger she cursed them all, her eyes reddened with wrath: “Because I was
  restrained when I was joined (with him) out of desire for a son—”
'22': >-
  “—you shall not be able to beget offspring in your own wives. From this day
  onward, let your wives be without children.”
'23': >-
  Having thus spoken, she cursed all the gods, and also cursed the earth: “O
  Earth, of manifold forms, you shall have many husbands.”
'24': >-
  “And you, O foolish-minded one, sullied by my wrath, shall not obtain the joy
  produced by a son; unwillingly (and against your desire), you shall receive my
  son.”
'25': >-
  Seeing all those gods thus afflicted, the lord of the gods then set out to
  depart toward the quarter protected by Varuṇa (the western direction).
'26': >-
  Having gone, the Great Lord, together with the Goddess, undertook austerities
  beside the northern mountain, upon a peak born of Himavat.
'27': >-
  “Thus, O Rāma, has the detailed account concerning the daughter of the
  mountain been set forth to you. Now, together with Lakṣmaṇa, listen from me
  also to the origin of Gaṅgā.”
'28': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-sixth canto of the Bālakāṇḍa in the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, called “The Greatness of Umā.”
