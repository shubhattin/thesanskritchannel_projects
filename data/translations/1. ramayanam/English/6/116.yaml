  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the one hundred
  and sixteenth sarga, entitled “The Reporting of Glad Tidings to Maithilī
  (Sītā).”
'1': >-
  Thus instructed again and again, Hanūmān, the son of the Wind-god, entered the
  city of Laṅkā, being honoured by the night-rangers (rākṣasas).
'2': >-
  Having entered the city of Laṅkā and, with due leave, having obtained
  Vibhīṣaṇa’s permission, Hanūmān—so permitted by him—then proceeded to the
  grove (Aśoka-vāṭikā).
'3': >-
  Entering in the proper manner, that best of monkeys made himself known to
  Sītā, and beheld her—without the red cosmetic (on her feet), full of
  anxiety—like Rohiṇī bereft of her beauty.
'4': >-
  At the foot of a tree he saw her, joyless and surrounded by rākṣasī-women.
  Quietly approaching, bowed low and humble, he went up to her and paid
  reverence.
'5': >-
  Seeing that mighty Hanūmān come, the divine lady (Sītā) remained silent; yet,
  on beholding him and remembering (who he was), she became glad at heart.
'6': >-
  Beholding the gracious face of hers, Hanūmān, foremost among leaping monkeys,
  began to relate in full the entire message of Rāma.
'7': >-
  “O Vaidehī, Rāma is well, together with Sugrīva and Lakṣmaṇa. Successful in
  his purpose, he is in welfare—his foes slain, a conqueror of enemies.
'8': >-
  “With Vibhīṣaṇa’s aid, and with the monkeys alongside him, Rāma has slain
  Rāvaṇa, O Lady—and the valiant one (Lakṣmaṇa) too (has wrought great deeds in
  that victory).”
'9': >-
  “I tell you this glad news, O Lady, and I honour you yet again: by your
  majesty, O knower of dharma, great was Rāma in battle.
'10': >-
  “This victory has been won, O Sītā. Be composed; let your fever of grief
  depart. Rāvaṇa, the enemy, has been slain, and Laṅkā too has been brought
  under control.
'11': >-
  “For I, sleeping not, held fast to my resolve for your deliverance. That vow
  has been fulfilled—after the bridge was bound across the mighty ocean.
'12': >-
  “No agitation is to be made now, while you dwell in the house of Rāvaṇa; for
  this sovereignty over Laṅkā has been effected under Vibhīṣaṇa’s governance.
'13': >-
  “Therefore be reassured; trustfully you shall return to your own home. And he
  (Rāma) is coming, overjoyed, eager for the sight of you.
'14': >-
  Thus addressed, that goddess Sītā, moon-faced, was so choked with delight that
  she was unable to utter a word.
'15': >-
  Then the foremost of monkeys spoke to Sītā, who remained without reply: “What
  do you ponder, O Lady? Why do you not speak to me?”
'16': >-
  So spoken to by Hanūmān, Sītā—steadfast on the path of dharma—replied,
  exceedingly pleased, in a voice faltering with tears.
'17': >-
  “Hearing this beloved news that rests on my lord’s victory, I have been
  overcome with joy, and for a moment I am bereft of speech.
'18': >-
  “For, O leaping one, though I reflect, I do not see anything fitting by which
  I may give you a proper welcome for your narration.
'19': >-
  “Indeed, O gentle one, O monkey, I do not see—upon this earth even—anything
  comparable by giving which one could gain happiness sufficient for your glad
  tidings.
'20': >-
  “Whether gold or fine gold, various jewels, or even sovereignty over the three
  worlds—none of these is worthy as recompense for your words.”
'21': >-
  Thus spoken to by Vaidehī, the leaping one replied, standing before Sītā with
  hands joined in reverence, through joy.
'22': >-
  “Devoted to what is dear and beneficial to your lord, and desiring your lord’s
  victory, you alone are worthy, O blameless one, to speak such affectionate
  words.
'23': >-
  “This speech of yours, O gentle lady—full of substance and truly
  tender—surpasses even heaps of diverse gems and even the lordship of the gods.
'24': >-
  “In truth, for me the excellences of godly sovereignty and the like have been
  obtained (already), since I behold Rāma—slayer of enemies, victorious, firmly
  established.”
'25': >-
  Hearing his words, Maithilī, the daughter of Janaka, then spoke to the son of
  the Wind a speech even more auspicious.
'26': >-
  “Endowed with excellent marks, adorned with the qualities of sweetness, and
  united with the eightfold intelligence—only you are fit to speak thus.
'27': >-
  “You are praiseworthy—son of the Wind, supremely righteous. Strength, valour,
  learning, steadfastness, prowess, and unsurpassed skill—(all these are in
  you).”
'28': >-
  “Splendour, forbearance, patience, firmness, and humility—without doubt—these
  and many other virtues shine in you alone.
'29': >-
  Then again he spoke to Sītā, unagitated and with humility—hands joined in
  reverence for joy—standing before her.
'30': >-
  “If you permit, I wish to slay all these rākṣasīs—those by whom you were
  formerly threatened.
'31': >-
  “These of dreadful form and behaviour—cruel, with eyes more cruel still—when
  you, devoted to your husband, came to the Aśoka grove in misery (they
  tormented you).”
'32': >-
  “Here, O Lady, I have heard those rākṣasīs with distorted faces, again and
  again speaking harsh words at Rāvaṇa’s command.
'33': >-
  “Deformed and misshapen, cruel, with cruel-haired eyes—those exceedingly
  terrible ones I wish to kill by many kinds of blows.
'34': >-
  “O rākṣasīs of savage speech, grant me this boon: with fists, with blows of
  the heel, and with these broad arms—”
'35': >-
  “—with strikes of the shins and knees, with the crushing of teeth; with
  cutting off ears and noses, and likewise with tearing out hair—”
'36': >-
  “—I wish to cast down and kill these who have done you harm, O renowned lady;
  striking them in many ways and battering them well,
'37': >-
  I will have them slain—those of fierce shapes by whom you were formerly
  threatened.” Thus spoken by Hanūmān, she—pitiable, compassionate toward the
  lowly—
'38': >-
  addressed Hanūmān with these words, after thinking and considering: “These
  (women) act under royal dependence, controlled by another’s power, acting
  under command.
'39': >-
  “And being obedient and servile, what cause is there to be angry with them, O
  best of monkeys? By the fault of unequal fortune, and by former evil deeds (of
  mine), this has come upon me.
'40': >-
  “By me is all this met; one indeed enjoys the fruit of one’s own actions. Do
  not speak thus, O mighty-armed one; this is a supreme course ordained by
  destiny.
'41': >-
  “It has been determined that this was to be attained by me due to the
  conjunction of my condition (and circumstance). Weak as I am, I endure here
  the slave-women of Rāvaṇa.
'42': >-
  “Ordered by the rākṣasa, the rākṣasīs threaten me here; when he was slain,
  they do not continue their threatening, O son of the Wind.
'43': >-
  “Near a tiger there is an ancient verse, consonant with dharma, sung by a
  bear. Understand it, O leaping one:
'44': >-
  ‘One does not take upon oneself the sin of others’ sinful deeds; rather, one
  must guard the proper occasion, and the good have conduct as their ornament.’
'45': >-
  “‘Whether (beings are) sinful or virtuous, even if they deserve death,
  compassion is to be practiced by the noble; for no one is without fault.’
'46': >-
  “‘Even toward those cruel ones whose sport is harming the world, and who
  perform sinful deeds—even when they do wrong—one must not do what is
  unseemly.’”
'47': >-
  Thus addressed by Sītā, Hanūmān, skilled in speech, then replied to Sītā, the
  blameless wife of Rāma:
'48': >-
  “You are indeed worthy of Rāma—his lawful wife, endowed with virtues. Send me
  back with your message, O Lady; I shall go where Rāghava is.
'49': >-
  Thus spoken to by Hanūmān, Vaidehī, Janaka’s daughter, said: “I wish to see my
  husband, who cherishes his devotees.”
'50': >-
  Hearing her words, Hanūmān, the son of the Wind—high-minded—spoke these words,
  gladdening Maithilī:
'51': >-
  “Today you shall behold Rāma, whose face is like the full moon, together with
  Lakṣmaṇa—one whose friends stand firm, whose foes are slain, like Indra, lord
  of the gods, with Śacī (at his side).”
'52': >-
  Having spoken thus to Sītā, radiant like Śrī herself made manifest, the mighty
  Hanūmān went to where Rāghava was.
'53': >-
  Then indeed, that best of monkeys, Hanūmān, forthwith reported—word for word,
  in due order—the reply of Janaka’s daughter to Rāghava, who resembled the
  foremost of the gods.
'54': >-
  Thus ends, in the sacred and glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the first among
  poems, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the one hundred and sixteenth sarga, entitled “The
  Reporting of Glad Tidings to Maithilī.”
