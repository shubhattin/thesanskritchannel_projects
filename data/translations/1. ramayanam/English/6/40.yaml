  Now begins the Fortieth Canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Combat between Rāvaṇa and Sugrīva.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon Rāma, accompanied by Sugrīva and attended by troops of monkeys,
  ascended the summit of Suvela, a height extending for a circuit of two
  yojanas.
'2': >-
  Having stood there for a brief while, and gazing upon the ten directions, he
  beheld, on the charming peak of Trikūṭa, the city fashioned by Viśvakarmā.
'3': >-
  He saw Laṅkā, well-set and strongly founded, adorned with delightful groves;
  and upon the crest of its gateway-tower he saw the lord of rākṣasas,
  unassailable and hard to approach.
'4': >-
  He was attended at the sides by white chowries, and was resplendent beneath
  the victory-umbrella; he was smeared with red sandal-paste and adorned with
  jeweled ornaments.
'5': >-
  He appeared like a dark-blue thundercloud; his garments were overlaid with
  gold; and his chest bore the raised scars of wounds, as though made by the
  sharp tips of Airāvata’s tusks.
'6': >-
  He was wrapped in crimson raiment, dyed with the hue of a hare’s-blood red;
  and, like a mass of clouds in the sky veiled by the heat-glow of twilight, he
  seemed covered with a dusky radiance.
'7': >-
  As the monkey-lords looked on—and as Rāghava himself beheld—at the very sight
  of the rākṣasa-king, Sugrīva sprang up at once.
'8': >-
  Possessed by the rush of wrath, and endowed with courage and strength, he rose
  from the mountain-top and leapt upon the ground of the gateway-tower.
'9': >-
  Standing for a moment and surveying him with a fearless heart within, and
  treating that rākṣasa as mere straw, he spoke harsh words.
'10': >-
  “O rākṣasa, I am the friend and servant of Rāma, the lord of the worlds. Today
  you shall not be released by me, by the splendour of that king among men.”
'11': >-
  So saying, he sprang up instantly and leapt upon him; seizing that splendid,
  wondrous crown, he dashed it down upon the earth.
'12': >-
  Seeing him swiftly advancing, the night-roamer spoke to him: “Sugrīva, you
  shall become, in my absence, ‘one without a neck’!”
'13': >-
  Having spoken thus, he quickly rose and with both arms hurled him down upon
  the ground. But the monkey sprang up again and with his arms hurled him in
  turn.
'14': >-
  Their limbs were smeared with sweat as they clung to one another; their bodies
  were reddened with flowing blood; locked fast together, their motions
  checked—like two śālmali and kiṃśuka trees intertwined.
'15': >-
  With blows of the fists, slaps of the palms, strikes of the elbow, and smiting
  with the edges of the hands, those two mighty ones—the lord of rākṣasas and
  the lord of monkeys—waged a battle of dreadful and unbearable form.
'16': >-
  Having fought in close combat with exceedingly fierce momentum for a long time
  in the midst of the gateway-platform, they repeatedly lifted and flung one
  another, bending their bodies, their footfalls clinging to the very paving of
  the gateway-terrace.
'17': >-
  Pressing one another and with bodies locked together, they fell amid the
  stakes fixed like palisades. Then, touching the surface of the earth, they
  sprang up again; and, standing for a moment, they heaved deep breaths.
'18': >-
  Embracing and re-embracing, binding one another with the cords of their arms,
  those two joined battle again. Spurred on by fury, training, strength, and
  prowess, they moved now upon the various paths of combat.
'19': >-
  Like a tiger and a lion with newly bared fangs, like two young lordly
  elephants locked together, striking and grappling with their hands, the two
  fell together at the same time upon the ground.
'20': >-
  Raising one another up and then casting one another down, they wheeled through
  many courses of combat. Endowed with the strength that comes of exercise and
  training, those two heroes did not quickly succumb to weariness.
'21': >-
  With their excellent arms, like elephants restraining elephants, each checking
  the other as an opposing elephant, after a long time of fierce fighting they
  swiftly moved along the circular course of battle.
'22': >-
  Closing upon one another, each intent on the other’s destruction, they
  repeatedly faced off—like two cats contending for prey, again and again.
'23': >-
  They executed wondrous circles, and diverse postures; the patterned courses
  known as ‘go-mūtraka’; and advances and retreats.
'24': >-
  They moved crosswise, and also along crooked paths; they escaped from blows,
  avoided strikes, and ran in wide arcs.
'25': >-
  They rushed straight on, they sprang aside; they held their ground while
  grappling; they turned away and turned back; they charged forward and leapt
  back.
'26': >-
  Thus, both skilled in the ways of battle, Sugrīva the lord of monkeys and
  Rāvaṇa moved against each other in manifold combat-manoeuvres.
'27': >-
  In the meantime, the rākṣasa set about to employ his own power of illusion.
  Perceiving this, the monkey-king moved to counter it.
'28': >-
  Then he sprang into the sky—one who had conquered fatigue and mastered his
  exertion. Rāvaṇa, remaining where he was, was deceived by the monkey-lord.
'29': >-
  Then the foremost lord of monkeys, whose fame in battle had already been won,
  having engaged the lord of night-rangers in combat to the point of tiring him,
  leapt across the exceedingly vast expanse of the sky; and that son of the Sun
  returned to the side of Rāma, amid the strength of the monkey host.
'30': >-
  Thus, the son of the Sun, having performed that deed there, re-entered the
  army, swift as the wind, rejoicing; increasing the martial ardour of Rāma, the
  son of the king among Raghu’s line, that lord of monkeys was honoured by the
  foremost of the tree-dwelling hosts.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the Fortieth Canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic, entitled “The Combat between Rāvaṇa and Sugrīva.”
