  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-fifth canto, named “The Narrative of Saudāsa.”
'1': >-
  Having dispatched the entire army onward, Śatrughna alone, after residing for
  only a month upon the road, then went swiftly in haste.
'2': >-
  The heroic delight of the Rāghavas, halting but for two nights on the way,
  reached the sacred and excellent abode—Vālmīki’s holy hermitage.
'3': >-
  Having paid reverent salutations to the great-souled Vālmīki, the foremost of
  sages, he stood with joined palms and spoke these words.
'4': >-
  “O Blessed One, I desire to dwell here. I have come on my elder brother’s
  business. Tomorrow at dawn I shall depart for the western quarter, the region
  of Varuṇa.”
'5': >-
  Hearing Śatrughna’s words, the best of ascetics smiled and replied to that
  great-souled one: “Welcome to you, O greatly renowned prince.”
'6': >-
  “This hermitage, gentle one, belongs indeed to the lineage of the Rāghavas.
  Accept from me without hesitation a seat, water for the feet, and the offering
  of honor.”
'7': >-
  Then, having received that worshipful hospitality and a meal of fruits and
  roots, the descendant of Kakutstha ate, and attained the highest satisfaction.
'8': >-
  After eating the fruits and roots, he spoke to that great seer: “Whose
  sacrificial ground is this—this yāga-enclosure and its appurtenances—near your
  hermitage?”
'9': >-
  Hearing his speech, Vālmīki replied: “Śatrughna, listen—this was formerly the
  sacred seat and dwelling of one.”
'10': >-
  “Among your forefathers there was a king named Saudāsa. Of that lord of men
  there was a son named Vīrasaha—mighty in valor and exceedingly righteous.”
'11': >-
  “While Saudāsa was still but a boy, he began to hunt. That brave one saw two
  rākṣasas roaming about.”
'12': >-
  “Terrible, in the form of tigers, they were devouring many thousands of
  animals; yet unsated, they did not attain any fullness.”
'13': >-
  “Seeing those two rākṣasas, and the forest made devoid of game, he was seized
  by great wrath and struck down one of them with a mighty arrow.”
'14': >-
  “Having felled that one, Saudāsa, the bull among men, free from fever and with
  his agitation stilled, beheld the rākṣasa lying slain.”
'15': >-
  “Seeing him looking on, the companion of that rākṣasa—its ally—caused dreadful
  anguish and spoke to Saudāsa thus.”
'16': >-
  ‘Because you have slain my companion who had committed no offense, therefore,
  most sinful one, I shall render to you a retaliation in return.’
'17': >-
  “Having spoken so, that rākṣasa vanished there itself. In course of time, by
  the turning of fate, that king became known as Mitrasaha.”
'18': >-
  “That king also performed a sacrifice near this hermitage—a great Aśvamedha, a
  mighty rite—which Vasiṣṭha himself supervised.”
'19': >-
  “There the sacrifice was vast, extending over many tens of thousands of years;
  endowed with supreme splendor, it became like a sacrifice of the gods.”
'20': >-
  “Then, at the conclusion of the sacrifice, remembering the former enmity, the
  rākṣasa, assuming the form of a brāhmaṇa, spoke thus to the king.”
'21': >-
  ‘The end of this sacrifice has arrived. My food is meat. Let it be given here
  quickly indeed; no deliberation is to be made in this matter.’
'22': >-
  “Hearing these uttered words spoken by the rākṣasa in the guise of a brāhmaṇa,
  the lord of the earth addressed one skilled in preparing meats.”
'23': >-
  ‘Make quickly, in such a manner, a sweet and well-flavored
  offering—meat-food—so that it becomes a fitting meal, and so that the guru may
  be satisfied.’
'24': >-
  “By the command of the sovereign, the cook, his mind confounded, set about it.
  Then that rākṣasa again contrived there the disguise of a cook.”
'25': >-
  “Thereafter he presented human flesh to the king, saying: ‘This is a delicious
  oblation, and meat-food has been brought.’”
'26': >-
  “O tiger among men, that meal—meat-food—stolen by the rākṣasa, he served to
  Vasiṣṭha together with his wife, Madayantī.”
'27': >-
  “Recognizing that meat as human flesh that had come into the vessel, the
  brāhmaṇa, seized by great wrath, began to pronounce a curse.”
'28': >-
  ‘Since you, O king, desire to give me this food, therefore this very food
  shall become yours—of this there is no doubt.’
'29': >-
  “Then, angered, Saudāsa took up water in his hand and began to curse Vasiṣṭha;
  but his wife restrained him.”
'30': >-
  “‘O king, Vasiṣṭha—the blessed ṛṣi—is our lord and master. You are not able to
  counter-curse that preceptor, who is like a god.’”
'31': >-
  “Then that righteous king released the water, charged with anger and endowed
  with fiery power; and he poured it upon his own feet.”
'32': >-
  “By that act, the two feet of the king then became stained and mottled. From
  that time onward, that exceedingly illustrious king Saudāsa became known as
  Kalmāṣapāda; and as such the monarch was famed.”
'33': >-
  “That king, together with his wife, bowed down again and again, and once more
  spoke to Vasiṣṭha what had been uttered by that rākṣasa in brāhmaṇa-form.”
'34': >-
  “Hearing from the sovereign that the matter had been distorted by the rākṣasa,
  Vasiṣṭha again spoke to the king, the bull among men.”
'35': >-
  “‘The words I uttered while overcome with wrath cannot be made vain. Yet I
  shall grant you a boon.’”
'36': >-
  “‘In twelve years the curse shall come to its end; and by my grace, O lord of
  kings, you will not remember what has elapsed.’”
'37': >-
  “Thus that king, subduer of foes, endured the curse, and afterward regained
  his kingdom and protected his subjects as before.”
'38': >-
  “That auspicious sacrificial site of Kalmāṣapāda—near this hermitage—is what
  you ask me about, O Rāghava.”
'39': >-
  Hearing that exceedingly dreadful account of that lord of the earth, he
  entered his leaf-hut after saluting the great seer.
'40': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fifth canto of the Uttarakāṇḍa in the holy, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Primeval Epic, entitled “The Narrative of Saudāsa.”
