  Now begins the one hundred and twenty-fourth sarga (chapter) in the Yuddha
  Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Presentation of the Puṣpaka
  (Vimāna).”
'1': >-
  When that night had been passed, and Rāma—the subduer of foes—had arisen at
  ease and in comfort, Vibhīṣaṇa, having first enquired after his victory, spoke
  to him with joined palms.
'2': >-
  “Baths and unguents for the limbs, garments and ornaments, sandal-paste and
  garlands—divine and of many kinds—(have been made ready).”
'3': >-
  “These women, skilled in adornment and lotus-eyed, stand here duly prepared, O
  Rāghava; they will bathe you according to the prescribed rite.”
'4': >-
  Thus addressed, that son of the Kakutstha line replied to Vibhīṣaṇa: “Do you,
  on this occasion of bathing, invite the Vānaras—Sugrīva at their head.”
'5': >-
  “For Bharata, the righteous-souled—tender and delicate, a mighty-armed prince,
  steadfast in truth—though born to comfort, is wasting away on my account.”
'6': >-
  “Without that son of Kaikeyī—Bharata, who walks in dharma—bathing, garments,
  and ornaments are not at all greatly desired by me.”
'7': >-
  “See to it, therefore, that we return swiftly to that city. For the road for
  one going to Ayodhyā is exceedingly difficult to traverse.”
'8': >-
  Thus addressed, Vibhīṣaṇa replied to the son of Kakutstha: “Within a single
  day I shall bring you to that city, O prince, son of a king.”
'9': >-
  “There is a vimāna named Puṣpaka—auspicious to you—shining like the sun. It
  belonged to my brother Kubera, but was taken away by mighty Rāvaṇa,”
'10': >-
  “after conquering him in battle—(that) supreme and divine craft that moves
  according to will. This has been preserved for your sake, O you of
  immeasurable prowess.”
'11': >-
  “That vimāna, resembling a mass of clouds, stands here. By that conveyance you
  shall go to Ayodhyā, your fever and weariness gone.”
'12': >-
  “If I am worthy of your favour, if you remember my good qualities, then, O
  wise one, dwell here for a while—if indeed there is friendliness in you toward
  me.”
'13': >-
  “After being honoured with every desired comfort—together with your brother
  Lakṣmaṇa and with Vaidehī, your wife—then, O Rāma, you shall depart.”
'14': >-
  “Accept, for the present, O Rāma, the hospitality and rite of welcome that I
  have arranged, with your army and with the circle of your friends, and with my
  heart full of joy.”
'15': >-
  “Out of affection, out of esteem, and out of friendly regard, O Rāghava, I
  entreat you. I am your servant; I do not, indeed, command you.”
'16': >-
  Thus spoken to, Rāma then replied to Vibhīṣaṇa, while all—Rākṣasas and Vānaras
  alike—were listening.
'17': >-
  “By you, O hero, I have been honoured—with excellent counsel and assistance,
  with your whole being, by your efforts, and by surpassing goodwill.”
'18': >-
  “I should not, O lord of the Rākṣasas, fail to do what you say. Yet my heart
  hastens to behold my brother Bharata.”
'19': >-
  “He it was who came to me at Citrakūṭa to bring me back—he whose word I did
  not fulfil, though he begged me with bowed head.”
'20': >-
  “(I long to see) Kauśalyā and Sumitrā and glorious Kaikeyī, and also Guha, my
  friend, together with the citizens and the people of the countryside.”
'21': >-
  “Grant me leave, gentle one. I have been honoured, O Vibhīṣaṇa. No anger
  should be entertained; O friend, I hold you in high esteem.”
'22': >-
  “Prepare for me swiftly the vimāna, O lord of the Rākṣasas. Having
  accomplished my purpose, how could it be proper that I consent to remain
  here?”
'23': >-
  Thus spoken to by Rāma, Vibhīṣaṇa, lord of the Rākṣasas, hurriedly summoned
  that vimāna, radiant as the sun.
'24': >-
  Then (there appeared) that aerial car, its limbs wrought with gold and inlaid
  with variegated designs, with a dais of vaidūrya-gems, encircled with turrets,
  and gleaming everywhere with the lustre of silver.
'25': >-
  It was adorned with pale-coloured banners and with pennons, and made splendid
  with golden mansions, embellished with lotus-forms of gold.
'26': >-
  It was strewn with networks of tiny bells; its windows were set with pearls
  and gems; encircled with rows of bells, it resounded on all sides with
  sweet-toned music.
'27': >-
  Fashioned by Viśvakarman, shaped like the peak of Mount Meru, it was adorned
  with lofty mansions, splendid with pearls and silver.
'28': >-
  With crystal-worked terraces and excellent seats of vaidūrya, furnished with
  priceless coverings, and richly supplied with great treasure, it was fully
  equipped in every respect.
'29': >-
  That vimāna, irresistible and swift as thought, stood ready. Having announced
  its arrival to Rāma, Vibhīṣaṇa remained there (awaiting his command).
'30': >-
  Beholding that Puṣpaka vimāna—moving at will—present and towering like a
  mountain, Rāma, noble in spirit, together with Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), was then
  filled with wonder.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the one hundred and twenty-fourth sarga of the Yuddha Kāṇḍa in the
  holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic, entitled “The Presentation of the
  Puṣpaka (Vimāna).”
