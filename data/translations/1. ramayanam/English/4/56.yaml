  Now, in the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-sixth sarga, called “The Inquiry concerning Sampāti.”
'1': >-
  Then all of them—the monkeys along with the king of vultures—were seated upon
  that stony ground on the mountain, where they had resolved to die; and he
  (Sampāti) drew near to that place.
'2': >-
  A long-lived bird named Sampāti, the illustrious brother of Jaṭāyu, renowned
  for strength and manly prowess, (came there).
'3': >-
  Coming out from a cave of that great mountain Vindhya, and seeing the monkeys
  seated there, he became glad at heart and spoke these words.
'4': >-
  Truly, in this world, fate follows its ordained course; thus has this food,
  appointed for me, after a long time come to me.
'5': >-
  “I shall eat, one after another, these monkeys—dead, dead!” So spoke the bird,
  gazing upon those leaping monkeys.
'6': >-
  Hearing those words of the bird, greedy for prey, Aṅgada, exceedingly
  distressed, then said to Hanumān:
'7': >-
  “See—under the pretext of Sītā, Yama himself, the son of Vivasvān, has plainly
  come to this place for the ruin of the monkeys.
'8': >-
  The work of Rāma has not been accomplished; the king’s command has not been
  fulfilled; and this unforeseen calamity has suddenly fallen upon the monkeys.
'9': >-
  What deed was done by Jaṭāyu, the king of vultures, out of love for
  Vaidehī—tell us all that was heard there, without leaving anything out.
'10': >-
  Thus do all beings—even those born in the wombs of animals—do what is dear to
  Rāma, giving up their lives, just as we (are ready to do).
'11': >-
  Moved by affection and compassion, they render help to one another; therefore,
  for the sake of aiding him (Rāma), we have renounced our own selves by our own
  resolve.
'12': >-
  For Jaṭāyu, knower of dharma, truly did what was dear to Rāma; and we too,
  worn out for the sake of the Rāghava, have abandoned our lives.
'13': >-
  We have entered the wilderness regions, yet we do not behold Maithilī. But
  that king of vultures (Jaṭāyu) is fortunate: slain in battle by Rāvaṇa, freed
  from fear of Sugrīva, he has attained the highest state.
'14': >-
  By the destruction of Jaṭāyu, by the death of King Daśaratha, and by the
  abduction of Vaidehī, the monkeys have fallen into doubt and bewilderment.
'15': >-
  The dwelling of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa in the forest together with Sītā, and
  likewise the slaying of Vālī by the arrow of the Rāghava—(all this has
  occurred).
'16': >-
  And (there has been) the destruction of the rākṣasas without remainder by
  Rāma’s wrath; and by Kaikeyī’s boon, this grievous perversion of events has
  been wrought.
'17': >-
  When he had heard those sorrowful words, and when he saw the monkeys fallen
  upon the ground, that king of vultures—great in counsel, his mind struck with
  intense astonishment—uttered a pitiable cry.
'18': >-
  But having heard that speech, thus spoken from Aṅgada’s mouth, the vulture,
  sharp-beaked and of mighty voice, spoke these words:
'19': >-
  “Who is it that proclaims, by his voice, the slaying of my brother
  Jaṭāyu—dearer to me than life—making my heart tremble as though shaken?”
'20': >-
  “How did the battle between the rākṣasa and the vulture take place at
  Jana-sthāna? This name of my brother I have heard today after a very long
  time.
'21': >-
  “I wish that you would help me descend from this inaccessible
  mountain-fastness—(I,) the younger, a knower of his virtues, and one whose
  valor is worthy of praise.
'22': >-
  “After a very long time, I am satisfied by this recounting; therefore, O best
  of monkeys, I desire to hear of his end.
'23': >-
  “How (did it happen) that my brother Jaṭāyu, dwelling at Jana-sthāna—yes, that
  very brother of mine—was a friend of Daśaratha?
'24': >-
  “He whose dear son is Rāma—the eldest, beloved of elders—(yet) because my
  wings are burned by the sun’s rays, I am unable to move about. I wish to come
  down from this mountain, O subduers of foes.”
'25': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-sixth sarga, called “The Inquiry concerning Sampāti,” in
  the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the sacred epic composed by the
  ṛṣi Vālmīki.
