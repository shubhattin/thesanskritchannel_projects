  Then, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Yuddha-kanda, begins the
  seventy-eighth canto, called “The Arming/Anointing for Battle of Makaraksha.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that Nikumbha had been slain, and that Kumbha too had been struck
  down, Ravana—burning with supreme wrath—blazed forth like fire itself.
'2': >-
  The lord of the night-rangers, overwhelmed by two forces—anger and grief—then
  dispatched Makaraksha, the broad-eyed son of Khara.
'3': >-
  “Go, my son—thus commanded by me—well furnished with strength. In battle slay
  those two, Raghava and Lakshmana, together with their monkey-host.”
'4': >-
  Hearing Ravana’s words, the heroic Makaraksha, Khara’s son, exultant at heart,
  replied to the night-prowler, “So be it!”
'5': >-
  Having paid obeisance to the Ten-necked one, and having also made reverential
  circumambulation, that mighty warrior went forth from his bright mansion by
  Ravana’s command.
'6': >-
  Then Khara’s son addressed the commander of the forces who stood near: “Let
  the chariot be brought swiftly; and let the army be brought quickly, without
  delay.”
'7': >-
  Hearing those words, the night-ranger who was chief of the troops brought near
  at once both the war-chariot and the host of soldiers.
'8': >-
  Having circumambulated the chariot, the night-ranger mounted it, and urged the
  charioteer: “Quickly now—drive forth the chariot!”
'9': >-
  Then Makaraksha spoke these words to all those rakshasas: “All of you, my
  rakshasas, fight on ahead of me.”
'10': >-
  “I have been commanded by the great-souled Ravana, king of the rakshasas, to
  slay in battle those two—Rama and Lakshmana.”
'11': >-
  “Today I shall kill Rama and Lakshmana, O night-rangers—Sugriva, that
  monkey-king—and the vanaras as well, with my excellent arrows.”
'12': >-
  “Today, by showers of spears, I shall burn up the great army of the vanaras
  that has come forth—like fire consuming dry fuel.”
'13': >-
  Hearing those words of Makaraksha, those night-rangers—all of them—strong and
  intent, equipped with weapons of many kinds, became fully prepared.
'14': >-
  Those cruel ones, able to assume forms at will, tusked and tawny-eyed—roaring
  like rutting elephants, with dishevelled hair—were terrifying to behold.
'15': >-
  Surrounding the huge-bodied son of Khara, those great-bodied warriors then
  advanced in high spirits, shaking the very earth beneath them.
'16': >-
  From thousands of conches and kettle-drums struck all around, and from loud
  whoops and clappings, a mighty tumult arose there.
'17': >-
  Then, from the hand of his charioteer, the goad slipped; and suddenly—by fate—
  the banner of that rakshasa fell down.
'18': >-
  His horses, yoked to the chariot, were bereft of their former vigour; with
  unsteady, confused steps they went on, wretched, their faces as it were
  tear-stained.
'19': >-
  A harsh and dreadful wind began to blow there, thick with dust, at the
  departure of that fierce and evil-minded Makaraksha.
'20': >-
  Though they saw those omens, the rakshasas, foremost in valour, gave them no
  thought and all marched out to where those two, Rama and Lakshmana, were.
'21': >-
  Dark in hue like massive elephants and buffaloes, repeatedly rent in the
  forefront of battle by maces and swords—yet crying “I, I!” in their pride of
  war-skill—those night-rangers wheeled and surged about again and again.
'22': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-eighth canto of the Yuddha-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the primordial epic, called “The Arming/Anointing for Battle of
  Makaraksha.”
