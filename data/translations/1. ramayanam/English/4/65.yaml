  Now begins the sixty-fifth sarga of Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa in the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Disclosure of the Measure of Strength.”
'1': >-
  Then, having heard the words of Aṅgada, all those bull-like chiefs of the
  vānaras—each in due order—declared there his own capacity and ardour for the
  going.
'2': >-
  (They were:) Gaja, Gavākṣa, Gavaya, Śarabha, Gandhamādana, and also Mainda and
  Dvivida, as well as Suṣeṇa, and Jāmbavān too.
'3': >-
  Thereupon Gaja spoke there: “I shall leap across ten yojanas.” Gavākṣa spoke
  of yojanas and said: “I shall go—twenty.”
'4': >-
  Then the vānara Śarabha spoke to those vānaras: “O plavaṅgamas, I shall go
  thirty yojanas.”
'5': >-
  Then the vānara Ṛṣabha spoke to those vānaras: “I shall go forty
  yojanas—without doubt.”
'6': >-
  Then the mighty, radiant Gandhamādana said to the vānaras: “I shall go fifty
  yojanas—without doubt.”
'7': >-
  Then Mainda, the vānara, spoke to those vānaras: “I have the prowess to leap
  the full extent of sixty yojanas.”
'8': >-
  Thereafter the highly radiant Dvivida replied: “Without doubt I shall go
  seventy yojanas.”
'9': >-
  Then Suṣeṇa—highly radiant, possessed of strength, the foremost of
  monkeys—declared: “In prowess I pledge eighty yojanas.”
'10': >-
  While they were thus speaking there, approving and assenting to them all, then
  the eldest among them—Jāmbavān—made reply.
'11': >-
  “Formerly, even we had some measure of speed and valour; but now indeed we
  have reached the far shore of age.”
'12': >-
  “Yet even so, it is not possible, matters standing thus, to disregard this
  task—for the sake of which the king of monkeys and Rāma have formed their
  resolve.”
'13': >-
  “Now understand the extent of the movement that remains to us at this time: I
  shall go ninety yojanas—without doubt.”
'14': >-
  And to all those best of Hari-warriors Jāmbavān said this: “Surely, my prowess
  in going was not only to this extent.”
'15': >-
  “Formerly, at the sacrifice of Virocana, the eternal Lord—mighty in
  splendour—while striding as Trivikrama, was circumambulated by me in
  pradakṣiṇā.”
'16': >-
  “But now I am aged, and in leaping my valour has grown feeble; whereas in
  youth mine was a supreme, matchless strength.”
'17': >-
  “At present, this alone is what I can accomplish today by my own going; and by
  this much, the accomplishment of this mission will not be achieved.”
'18': >-
  Then Aṅgada spoke further, with noble intent—approving then that wise
  Jāmbavān—he, the great monkey, spoke.
'19': >-
  “I shall go this great distance of a hundred yojanas; but as to my power to
  return—whether it will be so or not—of that I am not certain.”
'20': >-
  To that best of Hari-warriors Jāmbavān, skilled in speech, said: “Your power
  in going is well known, O foremost among monkeys and bears.”
'21': >-
  “Whether it be a hundred thousand or otherwise—this is not the proper rule to
  state; you are able both to go and to return, in terms of yojanas.”
'22': >-
  “For, dear one, the commander is in no way to be commanded; but all this host
  is to be commanded by you, O best of plavaṅgamas.”
'23': >-
  “You are as a ‘wife’ to us—established in the place of lordship; the lord is
  the ‘wife’ of the army—such is the course (to be followed), O scorcher of
  foes.”
'24': >-
  “Indeed, you are the very root of this undertaking, O subduer of enemies;
  therefore, dear one, like one’s wife you must always be protected.”
'25': >-
  “The root of the enterprise must be guarded—this is the policy of those who
  know the conduct of affairs; for when the root remains, all good qualities and
  the rising of the fruit come to perfection.”
'26': >-
  “Therefore you are the means for accomplishing this work—true in valour;
  endowed with both counsel and prowess, you are the cause here, O scorcher of
  foes.”
'27': >-
  “You are our elder and also the son of our elder (Vāli), O best of monkeys;
  resting upon you, we are indeed capable of accomplishing the objective.”
'28': >-
  Thus addressed, that great monkey—Aṅgada, son of Vāli—replied with further
  words to the very wise Jāmbavān.
'29': >-
  “If I do not go, then no other foremost vānara will; and again, for us this
  task would only become fasting unto death (prāyopaveśana).”
'30': >-
  “For, without fulfilling the message of that wise lord of the monkeys
  (Sugrīva), even if we were to go back there, I see no safeguarding of our
  lives.”
'31': >-
  “For he is a mighty ruler among monkeys—exceeding in favour, and also in
  extreme anger; transgressing his command, destruction would be ours upon
  returning.”
'32': >-
  “So indeed for this undertaking there is no other course; therefore you alone,
  who have understood the matter, ought to deliberate upon it.”
'33': >-
  Thus answered by the hero Aṅgada, the bull among plavaṅgamas—Jāmbavān—then
  spoke this excellent word to Aṅgada.
'34': >-
  “For you, O hero, in this mission nothing at all is to be made light of. I
  shall now rouse him who will accomplish the task.”
'35': >-
  Thereafter, seeking a secluded place, he urged on Hanumān alone—the foremost
  among leapers—who sat apart in ease, confident (in himself); that heroic chief
  among monkeys stirred that heroic chief among monkeys.
'36': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fifth sarga of Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa in the venerable, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the First Epic, entitled “The Disclosure of the Measure
  of Strength.”
