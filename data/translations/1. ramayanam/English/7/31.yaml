  Now begins the thirty-first canto in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Rāvaṇa’s Bathing in the Narmadā.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon Rāma, the mighty and radiant one, filled anew with wonder, bowed in
  reverence and spoke these words to the blessed sage Agastya, the foremost
  among ascetics:
'2': >-
  “O venerable sir, from the time when that cruel rākṣasa began to roam over the
  earth—tell me, O best of twice-born—were the worlds then left desolate and
  empty?
'3': >-
  “Was there then no king at all, nor even one who bore but the semblance of
  kingship—no one anywhere—whom Rāvaṇa, lord of rākṣasas, did not assail and
  outrage?
'4': >-
  “Or had the rulers of the earth lost their valour? Many kings, though endowed
  with excellent weapons, were cast out and many were subdued and defeated.
'5': >-
  Hearing Rāghava’s words, the blessed sage Agastya replied to Rāma with a
  smile, like the Grandsire Brahmā himself addressing the Supreme Lord:
'6': >-
  “Thus, oppressing the kings—O bull among kings—Rāvaṇa, O Rāma, roamed over the
  earth, O lord of the earth.
'7': >-
  Then he reached a city named Māhiṣmatī, resplendent like a celestial city,
  where there was ever the presence of Vasuretā.
'8': >-
  There, by the splendour of Vasuretā, the king named Arjuna was his equal in
  might; and there the Fire-god, ever abiding in the Śara-kunda, was present.
'9': >-
  On that very day, the mighty sovereign of the Haihayas—Arjuna, the powerful
  lord—went with his wives to sport in the Narmadā.
'10': >-
  On that very day, Rāvaṇa too arrived there; and Rāvaṇa, lord of rākṣasas,
  questioned the king’s ministers.
'11': >-
  ‘Where is King Arjuna? Declare it to me quickly and accurately. I, Rāvaṇa,
  have come desiring battle with that best of men. Let my arrival also be
  reported to him at once by you.’
'12': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāvaṇa, those ministers—men of keen understanding—spoke to
  the lord of rākṣasas concerning the whereabouts of the king.
'13': >-
  Hearing that Arjuna had gone forth along with the townspeople, the son of
  Viśravas withdrew and went toward the Vindhya mountain, resembling Himavat.
'14': >-
  Rāvaṇa then beheld the Vindhya, as though wrapped in clouds, as though the
  earth itself were whirling, as though it were scraping and engraving the very
  sky.
'15': >-
  It had a thousand peaks; its caverns were inhabited by lions; and with waters
  fallen in cascades it seemed, as it were, an ocean laughing aloud.
'16': >-
  With devas, dānavas, and gandharvas, with hosts of apsarases and with
  kinnaras, sporting there with their own womenfolk, it seemed like heaven
  itself, lofty and magnificent.
'17': >-
  From its flowing streams the water shone like crystal; and with hoods and
  flickering tongues of serpents it appeared as though Ananta himself were
  stationed there.
'18': >-
  Beholding the Vindhya—rugged with ravines and seeming to rise up, resembling
  Himavat—Rāvaṇa then went to the Narmadā.
'19': >-
  She was holy, with moving stones and rippling waters, and she flowed westward
  toward the Ocean.
'20': >-
  Her pools were churned and troubled by buffaloes, crocodiles, lions, tigers,
  bears, and excellent elephants, scorched by heat and tormented by thirst.
'21': >-
  She was filled with cakravāka birds, with kāraṇḍava ducks, with haṃsas and
  waterfowl, and with sārasas ever intoxicated with joy, sweetly calling.
'22': >-
  Her adornment was made by blossoming trees; pairs of cakravākas were, as it
  were, her breasts; her broad sandbanks were her hips; rows of swans were her
  fair girdle.
'23': >-
  Her limbs were, as it were, anointed with the pollen of flowers; her spotless
  garments were the foam of the water; her touch was the immersion in her
  stream; her lovely eyes were the fully blossomed lotuses. Then, swiftly
  descending from Puṣpaka, Rāvaṇa entered the Narmadā, best of rivers.
'24': >-
  Plunging into her as one would into a beloved and excellent woman, the
  ten-headed one then delighted on her lovely bank, frequented by many sages.
'25': >-
  There, seated with his attendants, that foremost of rākṣasas, after observing
  the Narmadā, said, ‘This is the daughter of the Gaṅgā,’ thus spoke Rāvaṇa.
'26': >-
  The lord of rākṣasas obtained joy born of seeing the Narmadā, and there he
  spoke playfully to his ministers Śuka and Sāraṇa.
'27': >-
  ‘Behold—by a thousand rays the Sun has, as it were, turned the world into
  gold; the maker of fierce heat has climbed to mid-heaven.’
'28': ‘Knowing that I am seated here, the Day-maker behaves like the Moon.’
'29': >-
  ‘Here the breeze too is cool with the waters of the Narmadā, fragrant, and a
  dispeller of fatigue; and even the wind, from fear of me, blows here in
  perfect restraint.’
'30': >-
  ‘This best of rivers—Narmadā, increaser of delight—stands like a timid maiden,
  with her waves as birds, crocodiles, and fishes.’
'31': >-
  ‘You all, wounded by weapons in battle by kings equal to Indra, are now
  sprinkled with blood, as though with the sap of sandalwood.’
'32': >-
  ‘Therefore, you should plunge into the auspicious Narmadā, the giver of ease.
  Enter her like great elephants in rut, their faces like vast lotuses, entering
  the Gaṅgā. Having bathed in this mighty river, you shall cast away your sins.’
'33': >-
  ‘And I too today, upon this sandbank bright as the autumn moon, shall slowly
  make an offering of flowers to Kapardin (Śiva).’
'34': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāvaṇa, Prahasta, Śuka, and Sāraṇa, along with Mahodara and
  Dhūmrākṣa, entered the Narmadā.
'35': >-
  By those rākṣasas—like mighty elephants, dark as collyrium and dwarf-palms—the
  Narmadā river was churned and agitated, like the Gaṅgā by great elephants.
'36': >-
  Then those mighty rākṣasas, having bathed in the Narmadā, came up from the
  water and brought flowers, for the sake of an offering to Rāvaṇa.
'37': >-
  On the charming bank of the Narmadā, shining like white clouds, in but a short
  while the rākṣasas made a mountain of flowers.
'38': >-
  When the flowers had thus been brought, Rāvaṇa, lord of rākṣasas, descended
  into the river to bathe, like a great elephant entering the Gaṅgā.
'39': >-
  There, having bathed in due manner and having recited the unsurpassed japa
  that ought to be recited, Rāvaṇa came up from those waters of the Narmadā.
'40': >-
  Then, having cast off his wet garments and clad himself in white raiment,
  Rāvaṇa proceeded with joined palms; and all the rākṣasas followed after him.
'41': >-
  As though endowed with bodies, the mountains themselves seemed to be under the
  sway of his movement: wherever Rāvaṇa, lord of rākṣasas, went, there and there
  a liṅga made of jambūnada-gold was carried.
'42': >-
  Placing that liṅga in the midst of a sand-altar, Rāvaṇa worshipped it with
  fragrances and with flowers sweet-scented like nectar.
'43': >-
  Then, having worshipped that Supreme and excellent One—remover of the
  afflictions of the virtuous, bestower of boons, adorned with the rays of the
  moon— that night-roaming one sang aloud, stretching forth his hands, and
  danced before Him.
'44': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-first canto in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “Rāvaṇa’s Bathing in the Narmadā.”
