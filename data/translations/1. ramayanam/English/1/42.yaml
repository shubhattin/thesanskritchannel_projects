  Now begins the forty-second canto in the Bālakāṇḍa of the revered
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Granting of the Boon to Bhagīratha.”
'1': >-
  When Sagara, O Rāma, had departed in accordance with the law of Time, the
  people and ministers of the realm caused Aṁśumān—righteous and of good
  conduct—to be accepted as king.
'2': >-
  That Aṁśumān, O delight of the Raghu line, was indeed a very great king; and
  his son, renowned as Dilīpa, was likewise illustrious.
'3': >-
  Having entrusted the kingdom to Dilīpa, O delight of the Raghus, Aṁśumān
  performed exceedingly austere penance upon a lovely peak of Himavān.
'4': >-
  That king, of very great renown—having gone to the forest of
  austerities—practised penance for thirty-two hundred thousand years; rich in
  ascetic merit, he attained heaven.
'5': >-
  But Dilīpa, of mighty splendour, hearing of the destruction of his
  forefathers, with his mind overwhelmed by sorrow, could not arrive at any
  settled resolve.
'6': >-
  “How shall the descent of Gaṅgā be brought about? How shall the water-rites be
  performed for them? And how shall I deliver these (ancestors)?”—thus he became
  wholly intent upon anxious thought.
'7': >-
  While he, ever pondering thus—self-controlled and guided by righteousness—a
  son named Bhagīratha was born to him, supremely dharmic.
'8': >-
  Dilīpa, of great brilliance, performed many sacrifices; and for thirty
  thousand years the king caused the kingdom to be governed.
'9': >-
  Yet, without reaching a decision regarding the deliverance of those ancestors,
  the tiger among men, afflicted by disease, went to his end according to the
  law of Time.
'10': >-
  That bull among men went to Indra’s world by the merit of his own deeds,
  having first installed his son Bhagīratha upon the throne by consecration in
  the kingdom.
'11': >-
  But Bhagīratha—the royal sage—was righteous, O delight of the Raghus; though a
  great king, he was without offspring, and both he and his subjects desired
  progeny.
'12': >-
  Entrusting the kingdom to his ministers, intent upon bringing about Gaṅgā’s
  descent, he undertook long penance at Gokarṇa, O delight of the Raghus.
'13': >-
  Standing with arms uplifted, enduring the five fires, subsisting on but a
  month’s food, and having conquered his senses—while he remained in that
  dreadful austerity,
'14': >-
  when a thousand years of that great-souled king had passed, O mighty-armed
  one, the blessed Brahmā—Lord and ruler of creatures—became well pleased.
'15': >-
  Then the Grandsire, accompanied by hosts of gods, approached the great-souled
  Bhagīratha as he practised austerity, and spoke to him.
'16': >-
  “Bhagīratha, great king, O lord of men, I am pleased with you, and with your
  well-performed penance. Choose a boon, O you of excellent vows.”
'17': >-
  Thus addressed, the mighty-armed Bhagīratha, of great splendour, stood with
  hands folded in reverence and spoke to the Grandsire of all the worlds.
'18': >-
  “If the Blessed Lord is pleased with me, and if there is fruit in my
  austerities, may all the sons of Sagara obtain water from me (for their
  rites).”
'19': >-
  “When the ashes of those great-souled ones are wetted by the waters of Gaṅgā,
  may all those forefathers ascend to heaven, completely and without fail.”
'20': >-
  “O god, I also pray for continuance of progeny, that our lineage may not
  perish—O god, in the line of the Ikṣvākus. Let this be my supreme boon.”
'21': >-
  To that king, who had thus spoken, the Grandsire of all the worlds replied
  with auspicious words—sweet, and of gentle syllables.
'22': >-
  “Great indeed is this wish of yours, O Bhagīratha, great charioteer. So be it;
  welfare to you, O increaser of the Ikṣvāku line.”
'23': >-
  “This eldest daughter of Himavān—Gaṅgā, born of Himavān—O king, to bear her
  (mighty) flow, Hara (Śiva) should be appointed there.”
'24': >-
  “The earth will not be able to endure the fall of Gaṅgā, O king. To sustain
  her, O king, I see none other than the trident-bearer.”
'25': >-
  Having thus spoken to the king, and having also addressed Gaṅgā, the Creator
  of the worlds departed to the third heaven, together with all the gods and the
  hosts of Maruts.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the forty-second canto in the Bālakāṇḍa of the revered
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Granting of the Boon to
  Bhagīratha.”
