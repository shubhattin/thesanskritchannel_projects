  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  eighty-sixth chapter, named “Crossing beyond the Sin of Brahma-slaying.”
'1': >-
  Then that best of men, Lakṣmaṇa, having narrated in full the entire account of
  the slaying of Vṛtra, proceeded to relate the remainder of the tale.
'2': >-
  Thereupon, when Vṛtra—of great might and a cause of terror to the gods—had
  been slain, Śakra (Indra) became enveloped by the sin of brahma-hatyā; and the
  slayer of Vṛtra did not regain consciousness.
'3': >-
  Taking refuge, as it were, at the far end of the worlds, he lay senseless and
  unconscious, and remained there for some time, coiling like a serpent.
'4': >-
  And when the thousand-eyed Indra was thus lost, the whole world became
  distressed; the earth looked as though ruined—devoid of unctuousness and with
  its forests dried up.
'5': >-
  All their streams ceased to flow; the lakes and the rivers likewise became
  without current; and there arose a great agitation among living beings,
  brought about by drought.
'6': >-
  But as this world was wasting away, the gods, their minds bewildered,
  undertook that sacrifice which Viṣṇu had formerly spoken of.
'7': >-
  Then all the companies of the gods, together with their preceptors and
  accompanied by the ṛṣis, came to that place where Indra, overcome by fear, was
  abiding.
'8': >-
  Beholding the thousand-eyed lord covered over by brahma-hatyā, they placed
  that Lord of the gods at their head and set about the Aśvamedha sacrifice.
'9': >-
  Then that very great Aśvamedha of the high-souled Mahendra (Indra) increased,
  O king, for the purpose of cleansing him from the sin of brahma-hatyā.
'10': >-
  When the sacrifice had been completed, brahma-hatyā approached that
  great-souled one and spoke these words: “Where will you appoint a place for
  me?”
'11': >-
  Then the gods, pleased and filled with delight, said to her: “Divide yourself
  into four parts—by your own power, O hard-to-approach one.”
'12': >-
  Hearing the words spoken by the gods, brahma-hatyā, who afflicted the
  great-souled, chose for herself a dwelling elsewhere, O Durvāsā.
'13': >-
  “With one portion I shall dwell indeed in rivers that are full and
  overflowing, for four months of the rainy season—subduing pride and
  restraining wantonness.
'14': >-
  With one portion I shall dwell in the earth at all times, ever and always—of
  this there is no doubt; in truth I declare this to you.
'15': >-
  That third portion of mine shall abide among women who possess the bloom of
  youth; for three nights, in those filled with pride, I shall remain—bringing
  pride low.
'16': >-
  And those who slay brāhmaṇas—men who were formerly without fault and against
  whom no taint could be alleged—upon them, O bulls among the gods, I shall take
  refuge with the fourth part.”
'17': >-
  Then the gods replied to her: “So be it, O Durvāsā; just as you have said, let
  all of that come to pass. Accomplish what you desire.”
'18': >-
  Thereafter the gods, filled with gladness, bowed down to the thousand-eyed
  Indra; and Vāsava became free from fever and purified in spirit.
'19': >-
  And when the thousand-eyed one was restored, the whole world became calm; and
  then Śakra honored that sacrifice, which appeared wondrous.
'20': >-
  Such indeed is the grace of the Aśvamedha, O delight of the Raghus. Therefore,
  O exceedingly fortunate king, perform the horse-sacrifice.
'21': >-
  Having heard these excellent words of Lakṣmaṇa—most pleasing indeed—the great
  king, whose valor and energy were equal to Indra’s, attained deep
  satisfaction, his heart rejoicing.
'22': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-sixth chapter, named “Crossing beyond the Sin of
  Brahma-slaying,” in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primeval epic.
