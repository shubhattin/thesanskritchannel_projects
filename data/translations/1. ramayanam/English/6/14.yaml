  Now begins the fourteenth sarga in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Dispute between Prahasta and Vibhīṣaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of the lord of the night-rangers (Rāvaṇa), and also the
  roarings of Kumbhakarṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa spoke to the foremost of kings among the
  rākṣasas words that were wholesome and well-reasoned.
'2': >-
  O king, by what means is this great serpent—your “Sītā-serpent”—to be subdued:
  whose coils are like the massed encircling folds of mighty arms; whose poison
  is anxious brooding; whose fangs are sharp though set in a faint smile; whose
  body is enormous; and who, with five fingers as it were, has five heads?
'3': >-
  Before the mighty monkey-chiefs, huge as mountain-peaks, rush upon Laṅkā—armed
  with fangs as weapons and nails as weapons—let Maithilī be given back to
  Dāśarathi.
'4': >-
  Before the arrows, impelled by Rāma—vajra-like and swift as the wind—begin to
  seize the heads of the foremost rākṣasas, let Maithilī be given back to
  Dāśarathi.
'5': >-
  Neither Kumbhakarṇa nor Indrajit, O king, nor Mahāpārśva and Mahodara, nor
  Nikumbha and Kumbha, nor even Atikāya, are able to stand in battle against
  Rāghava.
'6': >-
  So long as Rāma lives, you will not find release—though you be guarded by the
  Sun himself or by the Maruts; neither if you have taken refuge in Indra’s very
  lap, nor in Death’s domain; neither by entering the sky nor by plunging into
  the netherworld.
'7': >-
  But hearing Vibhīṣaṇa’s words, then Prahasta spoke in reply: “We know no
  fear—neither of the gods, nor of the dānavas—at any time.”
'8': >-
  “We fear not yakṣas, gandharvas, nor the great serpents; nor in battle do we
  fear birds or serpents. How then should fear arise in us from Rāma—ever—who is
  but the son of a human king, in war?”
'9': >-
  Hearing Prahasta’s words, which were not salutary, Vibhīṣaṇa—desiring the
  king’s welfare, with his understanding firmly set in dharma, artha, and
  kāma—then spoke words of great import.
'10': >-
  “Prahasta, and you too, O king, and Mahodara, and you, Kumbhakarṇa—what you
  say against Rāma is not in accord with truth; just as there is no path to
  heaven for one whose mind is turned to adharma.”
'11': >-
  “How could the slaying of Rāma be accomplished by me, by you, Prahasta, or
  even by all the rākṣasas together—when he is discerning in expedients and
  meaning—any more than one without a boat could cross the great ocean?”
'12': >-
  “The gods themselves, in the very presence of that king—who is foremost in
  righteousness, a great chariot-warrior, born of the Ikṣvāku line, and capable
  in all undertakings—become as it were confounded (when opposing him).”
'13': >-
  “Not so sharp are your arrows with heron-feathers, hard though they be to
  withstand, as those released by Rāghava: his shafts, piercing the body, enter
  within. Yet it is on that account that you boast, Prahasta.”
'14': >-
  “Those keen arrows, shot forth by Rāghava, are life-ending, equal in speed to
  a thunderbolt; they do not merely pierce and enter the body. Yet it is on that
  account that you boast, Prahasta.”
'15': >-
  “Neither Rāvaṇa, nor Atibala, nor Triśīrṣa, nor Nikumbha the son of
  Kumbhakarṇa, nor even Indrajit—nor you yourself—are able in battle to bear
  down Dāśarathi, who is the equal of Śakra (Indra).”
'16': >-
  “Devāntaka or Narāntaka, or Atikāya—the mighty, great chariot-warrior,
  great-souled one—or Akampana, whose firmness is like a mountain: none of these
  are able to stand in battle against Rāghava.”
'17': >-
  “And this king, overwhelmed by calamity, is attended by you—friends who are
  like enemies—for the destruction of the rākṣasas; for by nature he is harsh
  and acts without due consideration.”
'18': >-
  “Like a fearful nāga of great might, with endless coils and a thousand heads,
  violently constricting him—so has this king been bound fast. You should lift
  up and release the king from that bondage.”
'19': >-
  “Until, joining together—all his friends, fulfilling their purpose—having
  restrained him even by seizing him by the hair, the king must be held in check
  and protected, as one seized by terrible, mighty beings is restrained.”
'20': >-
  “For he, being swiftly covered over by you with the ‘ocean’ that is
  Rāghava—flooding and encompassing—falls into the mouth of the netherworld that
  is Kakutstha (Rāma). United together, you should strive to ferry him across
  (to safety).”
'21': >-
  “This is what is wholesome for this city together with its rākṣasas, and for
  the king together with his friends: I speak what is right, indeed, as my
  settled view—let him give Maithilī back to the son of the human king (Rāma).”
'22': >-
  “Having understood the strength of the other side and one’s own, and having
  considered one’s position, ruin, and likewise growth; and reflecting with
  discernment even upon one’s own party—only then should a minister speak what
  is fitting and what serves his master’s good.”
'23': >-
  Thus ends the fourteenth sarga in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Dispute between Prahasta and Vibhīṣaṇa.”
