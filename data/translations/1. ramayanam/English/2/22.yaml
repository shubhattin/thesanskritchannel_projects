  Now begins the twenty-second canto in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Predominance of Destiny (Daiva-prābalya).”
'1': >-
  Then, seeing Lakṣmaṇa afflicted, dejected, and especially resentful—like an
  enraged lord of elephants, with eyes widened by wrath—
'2': >-
  Rāma approached Saumitri—his dear brother, his friend and well-wisher—and,
  self-possessed, sustaining his courage with steadfastness, spoke these words:
'3': >-
  “Restraining anger and grief, taking refuge solely in fortitude; casting aside
  this sense of humiliation and embracing supreme gladness,”
'4': >-
  “all that has been arranged for my excellent consecration—set it all aside at
  once; accomplish the necessary task swiftly and without mishap.”
'5': >-
  “Saumitri, let the same bustle of preparations that was meant for my
  consecration now be the bustle of preparations for the cessation of that
  consecration.”
'6': >-
  “She because of whom the mind is distressed on account of my consecration—so
  act, with due apprehension, that she may not remain our mother.”
'7': >-
  “Even for a moment, Saumitri, I cannot endure to disregard, within my heart,
  the painful sorrow born of suspicion regarding her.”
'8': >-
  “I do not ever recall here—whether knowingly or unknowingly—having done even a
  little thing that was displeasing to my mothers or to my father.”
'9': >-
  “Truthful, resolved upon truth, ever steadfast in true valor; fearing the
  other world (the consequences hereafter), let my father be free from fear.”
'10': >-
  “For if, in this act, it were not fully carried through, a torment of mind—‘It
  is not truth’—would arise in him, and his torment would burn me as well.”
'11': >-
  “Therefore, Lakṣmaṇa, withdraw the rite of consecration; after that I wish to
  go from here into the forest, even before anything else.”
'12': >-
  “By my banishment today, the king’s daughter (Kaikeyī) will have achieved her
  purpose; then let them consecrate Bharata, the son, free from distraction.”
'13': >-
  “When I, wearing bark-garments and a deer-skin, bearing a circle of matted
  locks, have gone to the forest, Kaikeyī’s mind will be at ease.”
'14': >-
  “He by whom this counsel was devised, and whose mind has thus become
  well-composed—him I ought not to afflict; I shall depart into exile without
  delay.”
'15': >-
  “Saumitri, in my going away, and in the bestowal of the kingdom, and again in
  my returning—fate alone must be seen as the agent.”
'16': >-
  “How could Kaikeyī’s conduct be such in my sorrow, unless this disposition of
  hers had been ordained by fate?”
'17': >-
  “You know, gentle one, that among my mothers there has never been any
  distinction in my mind, nor has there ever been any special preference—either
  in her toward me, or in me toward her—even though I am her son.”
'18': >-
  “By those harsh words—meant to stop the consecration and to bring about my
  exile—by those fierce utterances of hers, I can explain nothing other than
  destiny.”
'19': >-
  “How could a princess endowed with natural goodness, and possessed of such
  virtues, speak like an ordinary woman, pressing me in the presence of her
  husband?”
'20': >-
  “That which is inconceivable is fate; it is not thwarted even among living
  beings. Clearly, in her and in me, a reversal has indeed fallen.”
'21': >-
  “And who, Saumitri, is the man that has the courage to contend with fate—when
  no other grasp or remedy is seen for the working of karma?”
'22': >-
  “Happiness and sorrow, fear and anger, gain and loss, being and
  non-being—whatever comes to pass in such forms: surely that is the work of
  fate.”
'23': >-
  “Even sages of fierce austerities, impelled by fate, abandon their severe
  restraints and fall away, overcome by desire and anger.”
'24': >-
  “That which, without having been intended, suddenly comes into motion here—and
  that which brings to a halt what has been begun by new beginnings—surely that
  is the work of fate.”
'25': >-
  “With this understanding of the truth, steadying myself by my own self, even
  though my consecration is thwarted, no distress arises in me.”
'26': >-
  “Therefore, being yourself free from anguish, follow my course, and quickly
  bring to a close the rites connected with consecration.”
'27': >-
  “With these very jars, all of them gathered for the consecration, my ritual
  bath for the vow will be performed, O Lakṣmaṇa, for the burning heat of my
  austerity.”
'28': >-
  “Or else, what need have I of these, made of royal substances? The water drawn
  up by me myself will serve as the ordinance for my vow.”
'29': >-
  “Do not, Lakṣmaṇa, give way to grief at this reversal of fortune. Whether
  kingdom or forest-dwelling—forest-dwelling is the greater good.”
'30': >-
  “Lakṣmaṇa, in this obstruction to my kingdom, our youngest mother is not to be
  suspected. Nor is father to be blamed in any way—destiny has seized them; you
  know indeed that destiny is of such power.”
'31': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-second canto, entitled “The Predominance of Destiny
  (Daiva-prābalya),” in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the
  Ādi-kāvya.
