'0': >-
  Now begins the Fourth Sarga, entitled “The Consecration of Rama
  (Ramābhiṣeṇam)”, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Hearing Hanumān’s words, spoken properly and in due order, then Rāma—of great
  splendour and of unfailing valour in truth—spoke.
'2': >-
  As for what you report—Laṅkā, the city of that dreadful rākṣasa—swiftly shall
  I destroy it. This I tell you in truth.
'3': >-
  In this very moment, O Sugrīva, approve the departure. The moment is
  well-joined for victory: the Sun has reached the middle (of the sky).
'4': >-
  Having stolen Sītā, whither can that one go? Where indeed shall he go with his
  life preserved? Hearing of my march, Sītā will regain hope of life—like one at
  the very end of life who, being tormented, has touched nectar and, as it were,
  drunk nectar.
'5': >-
  Today the constellation Uttarāphālgunī prevails; and tomorrow it will be yoked
  with Hasta. Let us set forth, O Sugrīva, with all the hosts assembled.
'6': >-
  And I behold the omens also, as they arise before me: having slain Rāvaṇa, I
  shall bring back Sītā Jānakī.
'7': >-
  Moreover, this trembling of my eye above (the upper eyelid) seems to proclaim
  my desire that victory has been attained.
'8': >-
  Then, honoured by the king of vānaras and by Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma—righteous-souled
  and skilled in discerning what is to be done—spoke again.
'9': >-
  Let Nīla go in front of this army to examine the route, surrounded by a
  hundred thousand powerful vānaras, swift in strength.
'10': >-
  O Nīla, lead the host quickly, O commander of the army, by a path rich in
  fruits and roots, with cool forest-water, and abundant in honey.
'11': >-
  Let the wicked rākṣasas not spoil the roots, fruits, and waters along the way.
  You must guard the path against them, ever vigilant.
'12': >-
  In low-lying tracts, in difficult forest-fastnesses, and in woodland regions,
  let the forest-dwellers spring about and reconnoitre—seeing whether the enemy
  has concealed forces (there).
'13': >-
  But whatever force is somewhat weak or inadequate—let it be made good right
  here. For this is our formidable task; let it be undertaken with full prowess.
'14': >-
  Let the mighty leaders—lion-like among monkeys—draw forward, in hundreds and
  in thousands, the terrifying foremost column, like the massed surge of the
  ocean.
'15': >-
  Let Gaja—mountain-like—and the mighty Gavaya go; and let Gavākṣa go in front,
  like a proud bull among cattle.
'16': >-
  Let Ṛṣabha, bull among vānaras, go with the monkey-host, guarding the right
  flank—the lord of those who leap.
'17': >-
  Let Gandhamādana—swift and irresistible like a rutting elephant—go stationed
  on the left flank of the monkey-host.
'18': >-
  I shall go in the midst of the army, gladdening the great mass of troops,
  mounting Hanumān as a lord mounts Airāvata.
'19': >-
  Let Lakṣmaṇa—like Yama in wrath—go accompanied by Aṅgada, just as the Lord of
  beings (the universal sovereign) goes attended by the lord of riches.
'20': >-
  And Jāmbavān, and Suṣeṇa, and the vānara called Vegadarśī—those three, the
  king of bears and the mighty-armed ones—let them guard your rear.
'21': >-
  Hearing Rāghava’s command, Sugrīva, lord of the host—great hero and bull among
  vānaras—issued orders to the vānaras.
'22': >-
  All those troops of vānaras, of mighty energy, sprang up and then quickly
  leapt forth from caves and from mountain-peaks.
'23': >-
  Then Rāma, righteous-souled, honoured by the king of vānaras and by Lakṣmaṇa,
  proceeded southward with his army.
'24': >-
  Surrounded then by vānaras like elephants, in hundreds, in hundreds of
  thousands, and even in crores and myriads, he went forth.
'25': >-
  That vast monkey-host followed as he went; all were delighted and joyful, and
  were also kept in order by Sugrīva.
'26': >-
  Leaping and vaulting, roaring and bellowing, the monkey-warriors went indeed
  toward the southern quarter.
'27': >-
  Eating fragrant honey and fruits, and carrying great trees bearing clusters of
  blossoms, they marched on.
'28': >-
  Some, suddenly exultant, shoved and hurled one another; others fell and sprang
  up again; some knocked others down.
'29': >-
  “Rāvaṇa must be slain, and all the night-rangers as well!”—thus the monkeys
  roared near Rāghava.
'30': >-
  In front, Ṛṣabha, Nīla the hero, and Kumuda too, with many vānaras, kept
  clearing and searching the way.
'31': >-
  In the middle were king Sugrīva, Rāma, and Lakṣmaṇa; the destroyer of foes was
  surrounded by many mighty and formidable warriors.
'32': >-
  The hero Hari—possessing the strength of a hundred—surrounded by ten crores,
  alone supported all (the force) and protected the monkey-host.
'33': >-
  Kesarin, attended by a hundred crores, and Panasa, and Gaja, and Arka—guarded
  one of his flanks with many (warriors).
'34': >-
  Suṣeṇa and Jāmbavān too, surrounded by many bears, kept Sugrīva in front and
  protected the rear.
'35': >-
  Their brave commander, Nīla—chief among vānaras—ranging about and leaping, the
  best of leapers, marshalled that army.
'36': >-
  Darīmukha, Prajaṅgha, Jambha, and the vānara Rabhasa—those heroes moved on all
  sides, urging the monkey-warriors onward.
'37': >-
  Thus those tiger-like monkeys, intoxicated with the pride of their strength as
  they went, beheld the best of mountains, the Sahya, with countless ranges.
'38': >-
  And they saw lakes in full bloom, excellent ponds and reservoirs—(all as if)
  knowing Rāma’s command and fearing his dreadful wrath.
'39': >-
  Avoiding the outskirts of towns and also the country districts, that great and
  terrible monkey-force—like the surge of the ocean—moved on.
'40': >-
  It streamed forth exceedingly terrible, with a frightful uproar, like the sea.
  Beside Dāśarathi were those heroic monkey-elephants.
'41': >-
  All quickly sprang forward, as horses do when urged on. Borne along by
  monkeys, the two bulls among men (Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa) shone resplendently.
'42': >-
  Like the moon and the sun as though grasped by two great planets, they
  appeared. Then, honoured by the king of vānaras and by Lakṣmaṇa,
'43': >-
  Rāma, righteous-souled, went southward with his army. Then Lakṣmaṇa, coming
  near Rāma along with Aṅgada, spoke to him in auspicious words—
'44': >-
  words complete in import, uttered by one whose understanding is ripe with
  meaning: “Having recovered the stolen Vaidehī and swiftly slain Rāvaṇa,
'45': >-
  you will return to Ayodhyā, prosperous in purpose, to one who is herself
  prosperous in purpose. And, O Rāghava, great omens—both in heaven and on
  earth—
'46': >-
  I behold as auspicious for you, all tending toward the fulfilment of your aim.
  A benign wind blows behind, gentle and pleasant, bringing comfort to the army.
'47': >-
  And these beasts and birds speak with full and sweet sounds; all directions
  are clear and serene, and the Sun is stainless.
'48': >-
  Uśanā (Venus), with tranquil flame, follows you; and the constellation of
  Brahmā (the Great Bear) is pure; and the supreme seers, purified, shine
  radiant—surely all to the right (in auspicious circumambulation).
'49': >-
  Triśaṅku, the royal sage, shines bright and unsullied, along with his
  priest—the ancient forefather before us of the great-souled Ikṣvākus.
'50': >-
  And Viśākhā, free from affliction, shines clear—our most excellent star,
  belonging to us, the great-souled Ikṣvākus.
'51': >-
  But the star of the Nairṛtas (the rākṣasas) is sorely oppressed; Mūla has been
  touched by what is rooted (adverse influence) and is smoked by a comet.
'52': >-
  All this has appeared for the destruction of the rākṣasas—whose time has
  seized them—when their constellation is afflicted by planets.
'53': >-
  The waters are sweet and clear, and the forests are fruit-laden; no harsh
  odours blow; the trees bear seasonal blossoms as is proper to the season.
'54': >-
  The ordered monkey-battalions shine exceedingly, O lord—like the hosts of the
  gods in the starry war. Seeing all this, O noble one, you should be glad.”
'55': >-
  Thus having heartened his brother, the delighted son of Sumitrā spoke. Then
  the monkey-host, covering the whole earth, marched on.
'56': >-
  From bears and tiger-like monkeys, with claws and fangs as weapons, and from
  the tips of their hands and feet, the dust raised by the vānaras was immense.
'57': >-
  It terribly covered the world, cutting off the splendour of the sun. The
  southern monkey-host, with mountains, forests, and sky (all obscured),
'58': >-
  went on, fearsome, veiling the heavens like an unbroken mass of clouds—its
  rear stretching continuously for many yojanas.
'59': >-
  All the river-currents seemed to flow as if in reverse; they passed
  bright-watered lakes, mountains covered with trees,
'60': >-
  level tracts of land, and fruit-bearing forests—penetrating through the midst,
  around, across, and below (everywhere).
'61': >-
  Covering the entire earth, that vast host went on. All of them, with joyous
  faces, went swiftly as the wind.
'62': >-
  For Rāghava’s cause the monkeys had set their prowess in motion, displaying to
  one another their delight, heroism, and surging strength.
'63': >-
  Born of youthful exuberance and pride, they performed various feats along the
  road: some went swiftly; others leapt up.
'64': >-
  Some vānaras, roaming the forests, made loud cries; snapping their tails, they
  also smote the ground with their feet.
'65': >-
  Flinging their arms about, others shattered rocks and trees; and
  mountain-ranging ones climbed the peaks of mountains.
'66': >-
  Some let out mighty roars; others made shrill cries; and with the force of
  their thighs they crushed many tangles of creepers.
'67': >-
  Yawning and bold, they sported with rocks and trees. Then, in hundreds of
  thousands and in crores upon thousands,
'68': >-
  the earth, splendid, was thronged with exceedingly formidable vānaras. That
  great monkey-host marched on by day and night.
'69': >-
  All were highly rejoiced, protected by Sugrīva. The vānaras,
  hurrying—delighting in war—did not rest even for a moment anywhere, eager to
  set Sītā free.
'70': >-
  Then, reaching the Sahya mountain, dense with trees and abounding in many
  forests, those vānaras climbed up.
'71': >-
  Though he beheld diverse woodlands and streams and waterfalls, Rāma went on
  through the Sahya and the Malaya mountains.
'72': >-
  The leaping monkeys broke champakas, tilakas, mangoes, aśokas, sinduvāras,
  tinsiśas, and karavīras.
'73': >-
  The leaping monkeys broke ankola trees, karañjas, plakṣas, nyagrodhas, jambūs,
  āmalakas, and nīpas.
'74': >-
  And on lovely rocky slopes, various forest trees, shaken by the speed of the
  wind, showered them with blossoms.
'75': >-
  The wind blew with pleasant touch, cool with sandal-fragrance, in
  honey-scented forests, while bees hummed in accord.
'76': >-
  And the king of mountains was further adorned with minerals; dust issuing from
  the ores, struck by the wind’s force,
'77': covered everywhere the very great monkey-host.
'78': >-
  On delightful mountain-broads, everywhere in full bloom, were ketakīs,
  sinduvāras, and charming vāsantīs; fragrant mādhavīs and blossoming clusters
  of kunda shrubs.
'79': >-
  Chiribillvas, madhūkas, vañjulas, bakulas, as well as rañjakas and tilakas,
  and nāga-trees—were in bloom.
'80': >-
  Mangoes and pāṭalikās, and kovidāras too, were in flower; and muculindas and
  arjunas, and śiṃśapās and kuṭajas likewise.
'81': >-
  Hintālas and tinsiśas, and also cūrṇakas and nīpakas; nīlāśokas and śaralas;
  ankolas and padmakas too.
'82': >-
  By the delighted monkeys all (the region) was thrown into tumult. On that
  lovely mountain were charming tanks and marshes as well,
'83': >-
  frequented by cakravākas, resorted to by flocks of kāraṇḍavas, filled with
  plavas and krauñcas, and visited by boars and deer.
'84': >-
  They were haunted on all sides by bears, hyenas, lions, dreadful tigers, and
  many fearsome serpents.
'85': >-
  With lotuses, fragrant saugandhikas in bloom, kumudas and utpalas, and diverse
  water-born flowers, the waters there were delightful.
'86': >-
  On its slopes many flocks of varied birds called. Having bathed and drunk
  waters there, the monkeys sported in the pools.
'87': >-
  Climbing the mountain, the monkeys splashed one another; and there were fruits
  of nectar-like fragrance, roots, and blossoms.
'88': >-
  There the monkeys, maddened with intoxication, broke the trees. Some fruits
  hung down of the measure of a droṇa (a large measure).
'89': >-
  Those honey-brown monkeys went, drinking honey at ease, breaking trees and
  dragging down creepers as well.
'90': >-
  Shaking the best of mountains, the bull-like monkeys proceeded. Others among
  the monkeys, intoxicated with pride, biting as they came down from trees,
  (drank) honey.
'91': >-
  Others took to the trees; still others drank. The earth became filled with
  those chiefs of monkeys, like land filled with lotus-fields when ripe (in
  bloom).
'92': >-
  Then, having reached Mahendra, Rāma of lotus-eyes—mighty-armed—ascended the
  summit adorned with trees.
'93': >-
  Then, having climbed the peak, Rāma, son of Daśaratha, beheld a sheet of water
  filled with turtles and fish.
'94': >-
  Crossing the Sahya and also the great mountain Malaya, they approached in due
  order the ocean, dreadful in sound.
'95': >-
  Descending, Rāma—best among those who delight (the hearts)—with Sugrīva and
  Lakṣmaṇa, swiftly went to the incomparable forest along the shore.
'96': >-
  Then, reaching the vast shore with its surface of washed stones, struck by
  torrents suddenly risen, Rāma spoke these words:
'97': >-
  “Here we have arrived, O Sugrīva, at Varuṇa’s abode. Now here must that
  consideration be made which confronted us earlier.
'98': >-
  This ocean, lord of rivers, is the final boundary. And this sea cannot be
  crossed by any means that lacks a proper method.
'99': >-
  Therefore let there be encampment right here; let counsel be held here—how
  this monkey-force may reach the farther shore.”
'100': >-
  Thus spoke the mighty-armed Rāma, worn by Sītā’s abduction; having reached the
  ocean, he then ordered the encampment.
'101': >-
  “Let all the armies be stationed on the shore, O chief of monkeys. The time
  for counsel has come for us regarding the crossing of the ocean.
'102': >-
  Leaving each to his own division, let no one go anywhere. Let the valiant
  monkeys go (to scout); our concealed danger too must be ascertained.”
'103': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, Sugrīva together with Lakṣmaṇa, stationed the army on
  the ocean’s shore, abounding in trees.
'104': >-
  That force near the ocean shone splendidly—like a second ocean, glorious, with
  waters pale like honey and yellowish-brown.
'105': >-
  Having reached the shore-forest, then those chiefs of monkeys took their
  positions, longing for the far shore of the great sea.
'106': >-
  As they were settling down, the sound of the army’s preparations drowned out
  the great roar of the ocean, as it were, and was heard over it.
'107': >-
  That great monkey-host, protected by Sugrīva, encamped in three divisions,
  wholly intent upon Rāma’s purpose.
'108': >-
  Having reached the mighty ocean, the delighted monkey-host gazed upon that
  great sea, lashed by winds of violent speed.
'109': >-
  Seeing Varuṇa’s dwelling—hard to reach, with its far shore vast and
  impassable, frequented by hordes of rākṣasas—the monkey-leaders sat down.
'110': >-
  Terrible with fierce crocodiles and sharks, at nightfall and at the close of
  day, it seemed to laugh with masses of foam and to dance with its waves.
'111': >-
  At moonrise it appeared, filled with moonlike reflections; strewn with fierce
  winds and great sea-monsters, and with timi-timiṅgilas.
'112': >-
  As though crowded with radiant-hooded serpents, the ocean—Varuṇa’s abode—was
  plunged with great beings and beset with many rocks and mountains (beneath).
'113': >-
  Most difficult, of perilous passage, unfathomable, a dwelling of asuras—its
  waters, churned and swayed by wind, were penetrated by makaras and
  serpent-like coils; and the water-masses, rejoicing, rose up and plunged down
  again.
'114': >-
  As if strewn with fiery powder, with shining waters and great serpents, it was
  dreadful—the abode of the foes of the gods—ever reaching down into the region
  of Pātāla.
'115': >-
  The ocean resembled the sky, and the sky resembled the ocean; thus, “ocean and
  sky” appeared indistinguishable.
'116': >-
  The waters seemed mingled with the heavens, and the heavens with the waters;
  in such a form did they appear, filled with star-like jewels.
'117': >-
  Between the heaving clouds and the sea filled with garlands of waves, there
  was no difference at all between ocean and sky.
'118': >-
  Striking one another, entangled, roaring with dreadful sound, the waves of the
  lordly sea resounded like great kettle-drums in the sky.
'119': >-
  Its roar was like the sound of waters laden with heaps of jewels, as if clung
  to by the wind; it seemed to leap up in anger, crowded with schools of fish.
'120': >-
  Those great-souled ones beheld the sea, whose waters were battered by the
  wind—like the sky when stirred and driven by gusts into tumultuous waves.
'121': >-
  Then the monkeys, seized with wonder, stood still and gazed upon the
  ocean—restless, as though swaying, with the clamour of wandering meshes of
  waves.
'122': >-
  Thus ends the Fourth Sarga, entitled “The Consecration of Rama
  (Ramābhiṣeṇam)”, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primordial epic.
