  Now, in the blessed Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, the forty-fourth
  canto, named “The Deliverance of Sāgara (Sāgaroddhāra).”
'1': >-
  Then that king, having gone to the ocean while Gaṅgā flowed on before him,
  entered into the depths of the earth, there where those (sons of Sagara) had
  been reduced to ashes.
'2': >-
  When, O Rāma, those ashes were thus flooded with the water of Gaṅgā, Brahmā,
  the Lord of all the worlds, spoke these words to the king:
'3': >-
  “O tiger among men, the sixty thousand sons of the great-souled Sagara have
  been delivered and have gone to heaven, becoming as the gods.”
'4': >-
  “So long, O king, as the water of the ocean shall remain in the world, so long
  shall all the sons of Sagara abide in heaven, even like the gods.”
'5': >-
  “And this eldest daughter of yours shall become renowned in the world as
  Gaṅgā; and, O lord, by the name (connected) with your deed, she shall remain
  celebrated among men.”
'6': >-
  “Gaṅgā is called Tripathagā, ‘she who goes by three paths,’ and also divine
  Bhāgīrathī. Since she sanctifies the three paths, therefore she is remembered
  as Tripathagā.”
'7': >-
  “Therefore, O ruler of men, perform here, O king, the libation of water for
  all your forefathers, and bring your vow to its fulfilment.”
'8': >-
  “For previously, O king, by your forefather of exceeding fame—by that noble
  one, the foremost among the righteous—this wish was not attained.”
'9': >-
  “And in the same manner, dear child, by Aṁśumān of incomparable splendour in
  the world, though he prayed to bring Gaṅgā down, the vow could not be
  completed.”
'10': >-
  “And likewise by the royal sage of virtues, whose lustre was equal to a great
  ṛṣi’s, whose austerity was like mine, and who stood firm in the kṣatriya
  duty—”
'11': >-
  “—by your father, the very illustrious, highly fortunate Dilīpa, though he
  prayed, O sinless one, he too was not able again to bring Gaṅgā down.”
'12': >-
  “But by you that vow has been surpassed and carried through, O bull among men;
  and you have obtained in the world supreme renown, most highly honoured.”
'13': >-
  “And this descent of Gaṅgā has been accomplished by you, O subduer of foes; by
  this you have attained a great abode and foundation of dharma.”
'14': >-
  “Bathe yourself, O best of men, ever devoted to what is fitting; in these
  waters, O foremost of persons, become purified and the recipient of holy
  merit.”
'15': >-
  “Perform the water-rites for all your forefathers. May well-being be yours; I
  shall go—let the king proceed—(I shall return) to my own world.”
'16': >-
  Having spoken thus, the Lord of the gods, Brahmā, the grandsire of all the
  worlds, the greatly renowned, departed to the world of the gods, even as he
  had come.
'17': >-
  But Bhagīratha, the royal sage, having duly made the excellent water-offering,
  in proper order and according to rule, for the sons of Sagara, the greatly
  renowned—
'18': >-
  —that pure king, having completed the libations, entered his own city; and,
  enriched in his purpose, that best of men ruled his own kingdom.
'19': >-
  And the people rejoiced upon reaching that king; and thus, O Rāghava, he
  became free from grief, his aims accomplished, and rid of feverish distress.
'20': >-
  “Thus, O Rāma, has the full course and expanse of Gaṅgā been told by me.
  Attain welfare; good be to you—indeed the time of twilight is passing.”
'21': >-
  Blessed, fame-bestowing, life-prolonging, conducive to sons, and leading to
  heaven as well is he who causes this (account) to be recited among brāhmaṇas,
  among kṣatriyas, and among others too.
'22': >-
  His Pitṛs are pleased, and the deities also are pleased—(by) this
  life-bestowing narration, the auspicious descent of Gaṅgā.
'23': >-
  He who hears it, O scion of Kakutstha, obtains all desires; all sins perish,
  and lifespan and fame increase.
'24': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vedic-seer’s (traditional) recension of the blessed
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Vālmīki Ādikāvya, in the Bālakāṇḍa, the forty-fourth canto named
  “The Deliverance of Sāgara.”
