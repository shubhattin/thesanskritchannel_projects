  Now begins the fifth sarga, named “The Searching of the Mansions,” in the
  Sundara-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then that wise one beheld, in the midst of the sky, the radiant moon—again and
  again pouring forth a canopy of moonlight—moving upon the earth’s view like a
  maddened bull wandering in a cattle-pen.
'2': >-
  And he saw the moon approaching: destroying the sins of the world, causing
  even the great ocean to swell, and making all beings shine forth in beauty.
'3': >-
  As Lakṣmī shines upon the earth when she abides on Mandara, and as she shines
  at twilight when she abides in the ocean, so also, abiding in the waters—on
  the lotus-lakes—the fair moon in the lovely night shone resplendent.
'4': >-
  As a swan shines when it sits within a silver cage; as a lion shines when it
  is in a cavern of Mandara; as a hero shines when he is mounted upon a proud
  elephant—so too the moon shone, stationed in the sky.
'5': >-
  The moon, full-orbed, appeared as if a great white mountain stood up with
  sharp peaks; as if an elephant with horns bound in Jāmbūnada-gold—thus did the
  moon, complete in all his horns (his phases), shine forth.
'6': >-
  With the chill, the mist, and the slime removed—his stain destroyed, as it
  were, by mighty planets and their seizing influence—bearing a spotless mark
  and resting upon the splendour of his own radiance, the divine moon, Śaśāṅka,
  shone brilliantly.
'7': >-
  As a lord of beasts shines upon reaching a rocky height; as a lord of
  elephants shines upon entering a great battle; as a king shines upon attaining
  his kingdom—so the moon’s radiance shone forth.
'8': >-
  With the faults of darkness dispelled by the moon’s rising light; with the
  fault of the rākṣasas’ craving for flesh grown strong; with the fault of
  hearts set in motion by Rāma’s beloved (that is, by love for Rāma)
  awakened—divine twilight, bright as heaven, came forth resplendent.
'9': >-
  The sounds of vīṇās and strings, delightful to the ear, were heard; virtuous
  women lay asleep with their husbands; and the night-roving rākṣasas too set
  forth—intent on sport, their conduct most wondrous and dreadful.
'10': >-
  That wise monkey beheld households in tumult—confused with drunken revelers
  and the intoxicated; crowded with chariots, horses, and noble seats; and
  likewise thronged with the splendour of warriors.
'11': >-
  They assailed one another, vying for superiority; they flung about their stout
  arms; they hurled out drunken babblings; and, themselves intoxicated, they
  cast insults at one another.
'12': >-
  The rākṣasas tossed their bosoms about; they flung their limbs upon their
  beloved women; they displayed wondrous forms; and they brandished even their
  strong bows.
'13': >-
  He saw some women fondling their lovers; and others there, again, sleeping;
  some with beautiful faces laughing; and others, enraged, breathing out
  harshly.
'14': >-
  And the city shone with great elephants also, trumpeting; with those well
  honoured and seated in fine assemblies; and with heroes, breathing loudly—like
  a lake that seems to breathe with the hissings of serpents within it.
'15': >-
  In that city he beheld the Yātudhānas (rākṣasas): some pre-eminent in
  intelligence, bearing pleasing names, trusting in themselves, leaders among
  the people; and many of diverse kinds, with various and pleasing appellations.
'16': >-
  Seeing those handsome ones, endowed with many qualities fitting their own
  natures, and radiant, he rejoiced; yet he also saw some among them again who
  were deformed.
'17': >-
  Then he beheld there their women—worthy of the best, of very pure disposition,
  great-souled—attached in mind to their beloved drink and delights, of good
  nature, like stars in the sky.
'18': >-
  He saw certain women, glowing, embraced modestly; embraced by their lovers in
  the midnight hour; embraced amidst their revels—like female birds enfolded by
  their mates.
'19': >-
  Others again he saw seated upon the terraces of mansions, seated comfortably
  upon the laps of their beloved; devoted to their husbands, devoted to duty,
  absorbed—yet seated as though possessed by Kāma (desire).
'20': >-
  Some were unclad, their hue like streaks of gold; some were exceedingly
  precious, of the colour of refined gold; and again some were of the colour of
  the moon’s lustre—though bereft of their lovers, their limbs still of charming
  complexion.
'21': >-
  And having attained their dear ones, delightful to the mind, filled with great
  gladness and with hearts rejoicing, those supremely lovely women—so did the
  foremost of monkeys behold them, happy within their houses.
'22': >-
  And he saw garlands of faces bright with moonlight; eyes large, with lovely
  lashes—clusters of fair eyes; and he saw also garlands of ornaments, charming
  like rows of a hundred lakes.
'23': >-
  Yet he did not behold Sītā—most nobly born, born in a royal lineage, standing
  upon the path—slender-waisted, of goodly birth, like a blossoming creeper,
  born of his very thought.
'24': >-
  Her who walked in the ancient path of righteousness; whose eyes were fixed on
  Rāma; who was smitten by love; into whose heart her husband’s mind, glorious,
  had entered; and who was ever distinguished above other women.
'25': >-
  Nor did he see her—tormented by heat, her throat choked with flowing tears—she
  who once wore an excellent, most precious golden necklace upon her neck; with
  fair-born eyelashes, with a lovely crimson throat—like a peacock dancing in
  the forest.
'26': >-
  Nor did he see her—like a faint line of the moon; like a golden line smeared
  with dust; like a line of colour wounded and then grown over; like a
  cloud-streak broken by the mighty wind.
'27': >-
  Not seeing Sītā—the wife of Rāma, lord of men, best of speakers—that monkey,
  after long searching, became stricken with sorrow, like one suddenly made dull
  and faint.
'28': >-
  Thus ends the fifth sarga, named “The Searching of the Mansions,” in the
  Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
