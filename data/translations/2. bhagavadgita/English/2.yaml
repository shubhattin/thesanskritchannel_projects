'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (Paramātmā).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': 'Now, the Second Chapter: Sāṅkhya-Yoga (the Yoga of Discriminative Knowledge).'
'3': 'Sañjaya said:'
'4': >-
  To him (Arjuna), who was thus overwhelmed with compassion, with eyes filled
  with tears and troubled, and who was sorrowing, Madhusūdana (Śrī Kṛṣṇa) spoke
  these words:
'5': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'6': >-
  Whence has this delusion come upon you in this hour of crisis? It is not
  befitting of the noble (ārya), it leads not to heaven, and it brings disgrace,
  O Arjuna.
'7': >-
  Yield not to unmanliness, O Pārtha; it does not befit you. Casting off this
  petty weakness of heart, arise, O scorcher of foes!
'8': 'Arjuna said:'
'9': >-
  How shall I, in battle, fight with arrows against Bhīṣma and Droṇa, O
  Madhusūdana—against those who are worthy of reverence, O destroyer of foes?
'10': >-
  Indeed, it is better in this world to live by begging than to slay these
  venerable elders, my teachers, of great soul. For, having slain one’s
  teachers, though they seek wealth and pleasures, we would here enjoy
  enjoyments stained with blood.
'11': >-
  Nor do we know which is better for us—whether we should conquer, or whether
  they should conquer us. Those very sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, having slain whom we
  would not wish to live, stand before us in the battlefield.
'12': >-
  My very nature is smitten by the fault of miserly weakness; my mind is
  bewildered as to dharma. I ask You: tell me decisively what is truly good for
  me. I am Your disciple; instruct me, who have taken refuge in You.
'13': >-
  For I do not see what would remove this sorrow that withers my senses, even if
  I were to obtain on earth a prosperous kingdom without rival, or even
  sovereignty over the gods.
'14': 'Sañjaya said:'
'15': >-
  Having thus spoken to Hṛṣīkeśa (Kṛṣṇa), Guḍākeśa (Arjuna), the scorcher of
  foes, said to Govinda, “I will not fight,” and became silent.
'16': >-
  To him, who was sorrowing between the two armies, Hṛṣīkeśa spoke, as it were
  with a gentle smile, O Bhārata, these words:
'17': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'18': >-
  You grieve for those who should not be grieved for, and yet you speak words of
  wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the dead nor for the living.
'19': >-
  Never indeed was I not, nor you, nor these kings; nor shall we ever cease to
  be, all of us, hereafter.
'20': >-
  Just as in this body the embodied Self passes through childhood, youth, and
  old age, so also does it attain another body. The steadfast (dhīra) is not
  deluded by this.
'21': >-
  Contacts of the senses with their objects, O son of Kuntī, produce cold and
  heat, pleasure and pain. They come and go; they are impermanent. Endure them,
  O Bhārata.
'22': >-
  That man whom these do not afflict, O best among men—who is the same in
  pleasure and pain, steady—he becomes fit for immortality.
'23': >-
  Of the unreal there is no being; of the real there is no non-being. The truth
  regarding both has been seen by the seers of Reality.
'24': >-
  Know That to be imperishable by which all this is pervaded. None can bring
  about the destruction of this immutable (avyaya) Reality.
'25': >-
  These bodies are said to have an end; but the embodied Self is eternal,
  indestructible, and immeasurable. Therefore, fight, O Bhārata.
'26': >-
  He who thinks this Self to be a slayer, and he who thinks it slain—both of
  them do not understand. This (Self) neither slays nor is slain.
'27': >-
  It is never born, nor does it ever die; having been, it does not come to be
  again. Unborn, eternal, everlasting, ancient—It is not slain when the body is
  slain.
'28': >-
  He who knows this (Self) as indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable—how
  can that person, O Pārtha, cause anyone to be slain, or slay anyone?
'29': >-
  As a man casts off worn-out garments and takes others that are new, so the
  embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters into others that are new.
'30': >-
  Weapons do not cut It; fire does not burn It; waters do not wet It; nor does
  the wind dry It.
'31': >-
  This (Self) is uncuttable, unburnable, unwettable, and indeed undryable. It is
  eternal, all-pervading, steadfast, immovable, and everlasting.
'32': >-
  It is said to be unmanifest, unthinkable, and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing
  It thus, you ought not to grieve.
'33': >-
  And even if you think of this (Self) as being ever born and ever dying, even
  then, O mighty-armed, you ought not to grieve thus.
'34': >-
  For to one who is born, death is certain; and to one who has died, birth is
  certain. Therefore, regarding what is unavoidable, you ought not to grieve.
'35': >-
  Beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their middle state, O
  Bhārata, and unmanifest again in their end. What cause is there for
  lamentation in this?
'36': >-
  One sees It as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder; another hears of It
  as a wonder; and even having heard, none truly knows It.
'37': >-
  This embodied Self in the body of all beings is ever unslayable, O Bhārata.
  Therefore, you ought not to grieve for any being.
'38': >-
  And, considering your own duty (svadharma), you ought not to waver. For a
  kṣatriya, there is nothing higher than a righteous war.
'39': >-
  Happy are the kṣatriyas, O Pārtha, who obtain such a battle, come of itself,
  with the gates of heaven thrown open.
'40': >-
  But if you will not undertake this righteous war, then, abandoning your own
  duty and your fame, you shall incur sin.
'41': >-
  People also will speak of your undying infamy; and for one who has been
  honored, dishonor is worse than death.
'42': >-
  The great chariot-warriors will think that you withdrew from battle out of
  fear; and you, who were highly esteemed by them, will fall into contempt.
'43': >-
  Your enemies will speak many unutterable words, slandering your prowess. What
  could be more painful than that?
'44': >-
  If slain, you will attain heaven; if victorious, you will enjoy the earth.
  Therefore arise, O son of Kuntī, resolved for battle.
'45': >-
  Having made pleasure and pain the same, gain and loss the same, victory and
  defeat the same—then engage in battle. Thus you shall not incur sin.
'46': >-
  This wisdom has been declared to you in Sāṅkhya (discriminative knowledge).
  Now hear it as Yoga. Endowed with this understanding, O Pārtha, you shall cast
  off the bondage of action.
'47': >-
  In this (path) there is no loss of effort, nor is there any adverse result.
  Even a little of this dharma protects one from great fear.
'48': >-
  Here, O joy of the Kurus, the understanding is single-pointed and resolute;
  but the understandings of the irresolute are many-branched and endless.
'49': >-
  The undiscerning speak flowery words of this kind, O Pārtha—delighting in the
  letter of the Vedas and declaring, “There is nothing else.”
'50': >-
  With desires as their very self, regarding heaven as the highest goal, they
  propound (rites) that yield birth as the fruit of action—abounding in specific
  ceremonies—aimed at enjoyment and lordly power.
'51': >-
  For those who are attached to enjoyment and power, whose minds are carried
  away by that (flowery speech), the resolute understanding is not established
  in samādhi.
'52': >-
  The Vedas deal with the three guṇas; become free from the three guṇas, O
  Arjuna. Be free from the pairs of opposites, ever established in sattva
  (purity), without concern for acquisition and preservation, and be
  self-possessed.
'53': >-
  To the enlightened brāhmaṇa, for whom there is water everywhere when a
  reservoir is flooded, so much utility is there in all the Vedas (as in a small
  reservoir)—that is, only so much as serves a purpose.
'54': >-
  Your right is to action alone, never at any time to its fruits. Let not the
  fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction.
'55': >-
  Established in Yoga, perform actions, O Dhanañjaya, abandoning attachment, and
  being even-minded in success and failure. Evenness of mind is called Yoga.
'56': >-
  Action is far inferior to the Yoga of understanding, O Dhanañjaya. Seek refuge
  in understanding; those who act for the sake of results are pitiable.
'57': >-
  Endowed with understanding, one casts off here both good and evil deeds.
  Therefore, devote yourself to Yoga; Yoga is skill in actions.
'58': >-
  For the wise, united with understanding, having abandoned the fruit born of
  action, and freed from the bondage of birth, attain a state that is beyond all
  sorrow and affliction.
'59': >-
  When your understanding crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then you will
  become dispassionate toward what is yet to be heard and what has been heard
  (in the scriptures).
'60': >-
  When your understanding, confused by what you have heard, shall stand firm and
  unmoving in samādhi, then you will attain Yoga.
'61': 'Arjuna said:'
'62': >-
  What is the description of the man of steady wisdom, who is established in
  samādhi, O Keśava? How does one of steady understanding speak? How does he
  sit? How does he walk?
'63': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'64': >-
  When a man wholly casts off, O Pārtha, all desires of the mind, and is
  satisfied in the Self by the Self alone—then he is said to be of steady
  wisdom.
'65': >-
  He whose mind is not agitated in sorrows, who is free from longing in
  pleasures, who is devoid of attachment, fear, and anger—such a sage is called
  one of steady understanding.
'66': >-
  He who is without clinging anywhere, who, meeting with good and evil, neither
  rejoices nor hates—his wisdom is firmly established.
'67': >-
  When, like a tortoise drawing in its limbs on all sides, he withdraws the
  senses from sense-objects—his wisdom is firmly established.
'68': >-
  The sense-objects fall away from the embodied one who abstains (from them),
  but not the taste (for them); even that taste also falls away upon beholding
  the Supreme.
'69': >-
  Even for a discerning person, O son of Kuntī, who strives (for mastery), the
  turbulent senses forcibly carry away the mind.
'70': >-
  Having restrained them all, let him sit steadfast, devoted to Me as the
  Supreme. For he whose senses are under control—his wisdom is firmly
  established.
'71': >-
  In one who dwells on sense-objects, attachment to them is born; from
  attachment arises desire; from desire arises anger.
'72': >-
  From anger comes delusion; from delusion, confusion of memory; from loss of
  memory, destruction of understanding; and from destruction of understanding,
  he perishes.
'73': >-
  But one who moves among sense-objects with senses disciplined and under
  control, free from attachment and aversion, and with the self governed—attains
  serenity (prasāda, clarity of grace).
'74': >-
  In serenity, the destruction of all sorrows arises for him; for the
  understanding of the serene-minded soon becomes firmly established.
'75': >-
  There is no understanding for the unyoked (undisciplined), nor is there
  contemplation for the unyoked. And for one who does not contemplate, there is
  no peace; and for the unpeaceful, whence is happiness?
'76': >-
  For, when the mind follows the roaming senses, it carries away one’s wisdom,
  as the wind carries away a boat upon the waters.
'77': >-
  Therefore, O mighty-armed, he whose senses are wholly restrained from their
  objects—his wisdom is firmly established.
'78': >-
  That which is night to all beings, in that the self-controlled one is awake;
  and that in which beings are awake, is night to the sage who sees (the Truth).
'79': >-
  As waters enter the ocean, which is ever being filled yet remains unmoved and
  firmly established, so do all desires enter him—he attains peace, not the one
  who hankers after desires.
'80': >-
  That man who, abandoning all desires, moves about without longing, without
  “mine”-ness and without egoism—he attains peace.
'81': >-
  This, O Pārtha, is the Brahmī state (steadfastness in Brahman). Having
  attained it, one is not deluded. Established in it even at the hour of death,
  one attains Brahma-nirvāṇa (liberation in Brahman).
'82': >-
  Om Tat Sat—thus in the Upaniṣads of the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, in the science
  of Brahman, in the Yoga-śāstra, in the dialogue between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna,
  ends the Second Chapter entitled “Sāṅkhya-Yoga.”
