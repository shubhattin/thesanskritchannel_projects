  Now begins the fifteenth canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Seizure of Puṣpaka (the celestial car).”
'1': >-
  Thereupon, seeing those thousands of Yakṣa-lords struck with fear, the lord of
  treasures addressed the great Yakṣa Māṇicāra:
'2': >-
  “Slay Rāvaṇa, O lord of Yakṣas—him of evil conduct and sinful mind. Become a
  refuge to the heroic Yakṣas, skilled in battle.”
'3': >-
  Thus spoken to, the mighty-armed Māṇibhadra, most difficult to overcome,
  surrounded by four thousand Yakṣas, joined battle.
'4': >-
  Then the Yakṣas, striking with maces, clubs, lances, javelins, spears, and
  hammers, rushed upon the Rākṣasas and harried them.
'5': >-
  Waging a tumultuous war, moving swiftly like hawks, they pressed hard, crying,
  “Grant what we desire; give it!”
'6': >-
  Then the gods with the Gandharvas, and the sages who proclaim Brahman,
  beholding that dreadful battle, were seized with great amazement.
'7': >-
  In that fight, by Prahasta a thousand Yakṣas were slain; and by Mahodara,
  another blameless thousand were slain.
'8': >-
  And then, O king, by the enraged Mārīca, eager for combat, two thousand more
  were brought down in but the space of a wink.
'9': >-
  What is the straightforward warfare of the Yakṣas, and what the reliance on
  the might of illusion of the Rākṣasas, O tiger among men? Therefore, in battle
  they surpassed them.
'10': >-
  Meeting Dhūmrākṣa in that great battle, Māṇibhadra, in anger, struck him on
  the chest with a club—yet he did not even tremble.
'11': >-
  Then the Rākṣasa Dhūmrākṣa, struck on the head by Māṇibhadra who had hurled
  his mace, fell down, reeling.
'12': >-
  Seeing Dhūmrākṣa struck down, fallen and drenched in blood, Daśānana rushed in
  the fray toward Māṇibhadra.
'13': >-
  As the enraged Daśānana charged, that foremost of Yakṣas, Māṇibhadra, smote
  him with three spears.
'14': >-
  Struck by Māṇibhadra, he smote the Yakṣa’s crown in battle; by that blow his
  crown was driven aside.
'15': >-
  Then, though pressed hard in combat, that Yakṣa did not quake. From that time,
  O king, he came to be known as “He whose crown is set askew at the side”
  (Pārśvamauli). A very great din arose upon that mountain.
'16': >-
  Then, from afar, the lord of treasures, the bearer of the mace, came into
  view, attended by Śukra and Proṣṭhapada and surrounded by Padma and Śaṅkha
  (the treasures).
'17': >-
  Beholding in battle his brother whose dignity had fallen away through a curse,
  that wise one spoke fitting words, worthy of the lineage of Brahmā:
'18': >-
  “Since you, O evil-minded one, do not heed me though I restrain you,
  later—having obtained the fruit of this—you will know it, when you have gone
  to hell.”
'19': >-
  “For the evil-minded man who, deluded, drinks poison and does not
  understand—he comes to know the fruit of that deed only at the end, when it
  has ripened.”
'20': >-
  “The deities do not rejoice in anyone by whom, even while adhering to dharma,
  you have been led into such a condition, and you still do not comprehend it.”
'21': >-
  “He who insults his mother and father, and also his teacher—having fallen
  under the power of the Lord of the Departed, he beholds the fruit of that.”
'22': >-
  “In this unstable body, he who does not gather merit through austerity—later
  that fool grieves, when dead, seeing the course of his own state (hereafter).”
'23': >-
  “From dharma come sovereignty, wealth, and happiness; from adharma comes only
  sorrow. Therefore, for the sake of happiness one should practise dharma and
  abandon sin.”
'24': >-
  “The fruit of sin is suffering, and it must be experienced here by one’s own
  self. Therefore, will a fool commit sin only for the sake of
  self-destruction?”
'25': >-
  “Indeed, in some, because of foolishness, understanding is not born by mere
  wish. The deity ordains everything; he whom fate has struck is struck.
  Whatever deed a man performs, such a fruit does he partake.”
'26': >-
  “In this world, men obtain as their fruit—sons endowed with intelligence, and
  valour and steadfastness—won by meritorious deeds.”
'27': >-
  “Thus you are headed for hell, since such is your mind. I will not speak
  further with you; in the case of men of evil conduct, this is the decision.”
'28': >-
  Thus addressed by him, his ministers—Mārīca and the rest—discomfited, turned
  their faces away and fled in haste.
'29': >-
  Then Daśagrīva was struck on the head with a mace by that great-souled
  Yakṣa-lord—yet he did not stir from his place.
'30': >-
  Then, O Rāma, in that mighty combat, the two smote each other; neither was
  bewildered nor weary—they were unenduring in wrath.
'31': >-
  Then Kubera released upon him the fire-weapon; the lord of Rākṣasas countered
  that weapon with the water-weapon.
'32': >-
  Then the lord of Rākṣasas entered into Rākṣasī illusion, and for destruction
  he produced a hundred thousand forms.
'33': >-
  As a tiger, a boar, a cloud, a mountain, an ocean, a tree—also as a Yakṣa and
  in the form of a Dānava—Daśānana was seen.
'34': >-
  And he made many such forms, yet then he himself was not seen. Thereafter, O
  Rāma, Daśānana, taking up a great weapon,
'35': >-
  whirled a massive mace and struck Kubera on the head. Thus struck by him,
  Kubera reeled, drenched in blood.
'36': And the lord of riches fell down like an aśoka tree whose roots have been cut.
'37': >-
  Then, surrounded there by the treasures such as Padma and the rest, he was
  borne away by them into the Nandana grove, as though revived by their breath.
'38': >-
  Having conquered Kubera, the lord of Rākṣasas, his mind exultant, seized
  Puṣpaka, his aerial car, the mark of victory.
'39': >-
  Adorned with golden pillars, with archways of vaidūrya gems, covered over with
  nets of pearls, and possessing wish-fulfilling trees of every desire,
'40': >-
  swift as thought, going wherever one wills, assuming any form at will, moving
  through the air; with steps of gold and jewels, and a platform of refined
  gold,
'41': >-
  fit to be borne by the gods, imperishable, ever delightful to the eye and
  mind; most marvellous, wondrous in its adornment, fashioned by Brahmā,
'42': >-
  made with every luxury, enchanting and unsurpassed; neither cold nor hot,
  auspicious, granting happiness in every season,
'43': >-
  mounting that car, which went according to desire and had been won by prowess,
  that king—of most wicked understanding through pride and arrogance—deemed the
  three worlds conquered.
'44': Having conquered the god Vaiśravaṇa, he descended from Kailāsa.
'45': >-
  Having by his own splendour attained that vast victory, the mighty one,
  wearing a spotless crown and garlands, shone indeed, seated in that supreme
  aerial car, like fire entering an assembly.
'46': >-
  Thus ends the fifteenth canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Seizure of Puṣpaka.”
