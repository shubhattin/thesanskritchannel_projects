  Now begins the one-hundred-and-seventh sarga of the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the
  glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Consecration of Kuśa and Lava.”
'1': >-
  Having dismissed Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma—overwhelmed with sorrow and grief—said these
  words to the family priest, the ministers, and the guild-leaders and citizens.
'2': >-
  “Today I shall consecrate Bharata, devoted to dharma, as king—heroic lord of
  Ayodhyā; and thereafter I myself shall depart to the forest.”
'3': >-
  “Bring in the preparations; let there be no reversal caused by the turn of
  time. Today itself I shall go the very way that Lakṣmaṇa has gone.”
'4': >-
  Hearing what was spoken by Rāghava, all the subjects were exceedingly
  distressed; bowing their heads down to the ground, they became as though
  bereft of life.
'5': >-
  And Bharata too, hearing Rāma’s words, fell senseless. Coming to himself, he
  censured the very idea of kingship and spoke this to Rāghava:
'6': >-
  “O King, I swear by truth—indeed, even in heaven itself—just as I do not
  desire the kingdom without you, O delight of the Raghu line!”
'7': >-
  “Consecrate these two—Kuśa and Lava, O King, O lord of men. Install the heroic
  Kuśa over Kosala, and likewise Lava over the Northern lands.”
'8': >-
  “Let messengers, swift in their enterprise, go to Śatrughna; and without delay
  let them announce to him that our departure is for heaven.”
'9': >-
  Hearing what was said by Bharata, and seeing also the citizens with downcast
  faces, tormented by sorrow, Vasiṣṭha spoke these words:
'10': >-
  “My son Rāma, look upon this earth: the people have fallen low. Knowing what
  they desire to be done, do not act in a manner displeasing to them.”
'11': >-
  But at Vasiṣṭha’s words, having raised up the people, the son of Kakutstha
  said to them all, “What shall I do?”
'12': >-
  Then all the subjects spoke to Rāma: “As you go forth, we shall follow you
  wherever, O Rāma, you will go.”
'13': >-
  “If you have affection for the citizens, if your love is unsurpassed, then, O
  Kakutstha, with our sons and wives we shall come with you upon the righteous
  path.”
'14': >-
  “Whether it be a forest of austerities, or an inaccessible wilderness, or a
  river, or even the ocean—if we are not to be abandoned by you, O Lord, lead us
  all.”
'15': >-
  “This is our highest joy; this is our supreme boon. Ever lodged within our
  hearts is the love to follow you, O King.”
'16': >-
  To the firm devotion of the citizens he replied, “So be it indeed.” And,
  having regard to the decree of destiny, on that very day Rāghava (resolved
  upon what must be done).
'17': >-
  Rāma consecrated both Kuśa and Lava, the great-souled sons: the heroic Kuśa in
  Kosala, and likewise Lava in the Northern regions.
'18': >-
  Having consecrated his two sons, he established them upon the throne in the
  city. Then the mighty-armed one embraced them, and again and again kissed them
  upon the head.
'19': >-
  He gave to each of them wealth: thousands of chariots, ten-thousands of
  elephants, and ten-thousands of horses.
'20': >-
  He then sent the two brothers, Kuśa and Lava, to their own cities—abounding in
  many jewels and much wealth, and thronged with delighted and well-nourished
  people.
'21': >-
  Having consecrated the two heroic sons and established them in their cities,
  he dispatched messengers to the great-souled Śatrughna.
'22': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-seventh sarga of the Uttara Kāṇḍa in the sacred,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādikāvya, called “The Consecration of Kuśa
  and Lava.”
