  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninety-eighth chapter, called “The Pacification of Rāma’s Wrath.”
'1': >-
  When Vaidehī had entered Rasātala, all the Vānaras cried out, “Well done! Well
  done, O most chaste lady!” in the presence of Rāma, and the sages likewise
  exclaimed the same.
'2': >-
  Leaning upon a staff of wood, his eyes agitated with tears, his head bent
  down, his mind afflicted with dejection, Rāma sat there, overwhelmed with
  extreme sorrow.
'3': >-
  And having wept for a long time, again and again letting fall streams of
  tears, Rāma—seized by wrath and grief—spoke these words:
'4': >-
  “An unprecedented sorrow seeks, as it were, to touch my heart—when before my
  very eyes Sītā, of lovely form, has vanished, like embodied Prosperity
  herself.”
'5': >-
  “Formerly, Sītā passed out of sight beyond Laṅkā, across the great ocean; yet
  even from there I brought her back—how much more then from the surface of the
  earth!”
'6': >-
  “O Earth-goddess, let Sītā come forth for me! Otherwise I shall display my
  fury, so that you may know me for what I am.”
'7': >-
  “Indeed you are my very mother-in-law; for from you the Maithilī was once
  drawn out by Janaka, as he ploughed, holding the plough in his hand.”
'8': >-
  “Therefore, let Sītā be brought forth; or else grant me an opening (a cleft).
  In Pātāla, or upon the summit of heaven, I would dwell—only together with
  her.”
'9': >-
  “Bring that Sītā to me; for I exist only for the sake of the Maithilī. If you
  will not give Sītā back to me, as she was, upon the earth—”
'10': >-
  “—then I shall shatter this entire earth, with its mountains and forests, just
  as it stands; I shall destroy the world—let everything here become water!”
'11': >-
  While the Kakutstha thus spoke—consumed by wrath and grief—Brahmā, together
  with the hosts of gods, addressed Rāghava:
'12': >-
  “Rāma, Rāma—O you of excellent vows—you ought not to give yourself to anguish.
  Remember the former truth (of your being), and remember the sacred mantra, O
  subduer of foes.”
'13': >-
  “Indeed, O mighty-armed one, I would not remind you of what is unsurpassed;
  yet in this moment, O unassailable hero, remember your Vaiṣṇava birth (as the
  Divine).”
'14': >-
  “For Sītā is stainless and chaste, ever devoted to you in past and future
  alike. By the power of her austerity rooted in refuge in you, she has happily
  gone to the realm of the Nāgas.”
'15': >-
  “Again, your reunion with her shall take place in heaven—of this there is no
  doubt. And in the midst of this assembly, understand well what I now declare.”
'16': >-
  “This very Rāmāyaṇa is your poem, heard as the best of poems. It will explain
  everything to you in full detail, O Rāma—of this there is no doubt.”
'17': >-
  “From your birth onward, O hero, your experience of happiness and sorrow, and
  also what is yet to come hereafter—all has been composed by Vālmīki.”
'18': >-
  “This is the Ādi-kāvya, O Rāma; in you it all stands established. For none
  other than Rāghava is worthy to receive the foremost share of the glory of
  poems.”
'19': >-
  “All this has been heard before by you from me, together with the gods—divine,
  of wondrous form, spoken in truth and without concealment.”
'20': >-
  “Therefore you, O tiger among men, firmly established in dharma—now hear the
  remaining portion, the future part, of the Rāmāyaṇa poem, O Kakutstha.”
'21': >-
  “The remaining part of the poem is called the ‘Uttara’; here lies what is
  left, O greatly renowned one. Listen to it, O mighty in splendour, together
  with the sages—this supreme account.”
'22': >-
  “Truly, O Kakutstha, this highest narration is not to be heard by anyone else.
  By you alone, O hero—by you, O delighter of the Raghus—must it be heard from
  the supreme ṛṣi.”
'23': >-
  Having spoken these words, Brahmā, the Lord of the three worlds, departed to
  the heavenly realm, the god going with the gods, together with their kinsmen.
'24': >-
  And those great-souled sages there, belonging to the world of Brahmā, having
  been given leave by Brahmā, returned—men of mighty energy—intent on hearing
  the remaining future events concerning Rāghava.
'25': >-
  Then Rāma, the supremely radiant one, having heard the auspicious speech
  spoken by the God of gods, addressed Vālmīki in these words:
'26': >-
  “O Blessed One, the great sages of the Brahma-world are eager to hear. Let
  that remaining future account of mine be set in motion tomorrow when the day
  has come.”
'27': >-
  Having thus reached a settled decision, and taking Kuśa and Lava with him, he
  dismissed that multitude of people and then went to the leaf-hut. And as he
  grieved for that very Sītā, the night passed away.
'28': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-eighth chapter, called “The Pacification of Rāma’s
  Wrath,” in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
