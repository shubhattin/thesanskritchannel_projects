  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninety-eighth sarga, entitled “The Slaying of Mahodara.”
'1': >-
  While their forces were being swiftly slain in that great battle, those two
  armies, locked in mutual destruction, became greatly diminished—like a lake in
  the height of scorching heat, its waters much dried up.
'2': >-
  By the slaughter of his own host, and by the killing of Virūpākṣa as well,
  Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, became enraged twofold.
'3': >-
  Seeing his own army wasted and being cut down by the monkey-faced warriors, he
  was seized by anguish in the battle, beholding the adverse turn of fate.
'4': >-
  Then he spoke at once to Mahodara who stood near him: “At this time, O
  mighty-armed one, my hope of victory rests upon you.”
'5': >-
  “Slay the army of the foe, O hero; display today your prowess. This is the
  time to requite the sustenance received from your lord; therefore fight well
  and without faltering.”
'6': >-
  Thus addressed, Mahodara, the rākṣasa chief, saying “So be it,” entered the
  enemy host—like a moth rushing into a blazing fire.
'7': >-
  Then that mighty one wrought great carnage among the vānaras—splendid in
  energy, urged on by his lord’s command and driven by his own valor.
'8': >-
  But the great-souled vānaras, seizing huge rocks, entered the dreadful enemy
  ranks and slew all those rākṣasas.
'9': >-
  Mahodara, exceedingly enraged, with arrows adorned with gold ornaments, in
  that mighty combat cut down the hands, feet, and thighs of the vānaras.
'10': >-
  Then all those vānaras, heavily harassed by the rākṣasas, fled in great
  haste—some in all ten directions, and some taking refuge with Sugrīva.
'11': >-
  Seeing the mighty force of the vānaras broken in battle, Sugrīva rushed
  straight toward Mahodara.
'12': >-
  Seizing a vast and terrible rock, like a mountain peak, the lord of the
  vānaras, of great splendor, hurled it to slay him.
'13': >-
  Seeing that rock suddenly falling upon him, Mahodara, unperturbed, pierced it
  with arrows, though it was hard to assail.
'14': >-
  Struck by that rākṣasa’s torrents of arrows, the rock was shattered into a
  thousand pieces, and fell then upon the ground, churning like a circle of
  vultures.
'15': >-
  Seeing the rock thus broken, Sugrīva, overwhelmed with wrath, tore up a śāla
  tree and hurled it; and he (Mahodara) cut that too into many fragments.
'16': >-
  And with sharp, rending arrows that hero, crusher of the enemy host, struck
  Sugrīva; and then, in anger, Sugrīva beheld a blazing iron club (pariṅgha)
  lying upon the earth.
'17': >-
  Whirling that radiant iron club and displaying it before him, Sugrīva, with
  the club’s fierce momentum, struck down Mahodara’s excellent horses.
'18': >-
  From that chariot, its horses slain, the hero Mahodara leapt down from his
  great car, and, enraged, the rākṣasa seized a mace.
'19': >-
  Those two heroes, one holding a mace and the other an iron club, advanced
  against each other in battle—roaring like a bull and an ox, like two clouds
  with lightning.
'20': >-
  Then, angered, Mahodara the night-ranger hurled his mace at Sugrīva—blazing,
  radiant like the sun.
'21': >-
  Sugrīva, of great strength, eyes reddened with fury, raised himself in that
  great battle as the exceedingly terrible mace came rushing toward him.
'22': >-
  The lord of the vānaras struck that mace with his iron club; and his club,
  shattered by the impact, fell swiftly upon the ground.
'23': >-
  Then radiant Sugrīva took up from the surface of the earth a terrible iron
  mallet, adorned on all sides with gold.
'24': >-
  Raising it, he hurled it; and Mahodara also cast his mace. Meeting one
  another, both weapons broke and fell upon the ground.
'25': >-
  Then, their weapons shattered, the two closed upon each other with their
  fists—filled with ardor and strength, like two blazing fires.
'26': >-
  Then they struck each other again and again, roaring repeatedly; and meeting
  one another with their palms, they fell to the earth.
'27': >-
  Leaping up swiftly, they struck each other once more; and those unconquered
  heroes flung one another with their arms.
'28': >-
  The two heroes, scorchers of foes, grew weary in the wrestling of arms; then
  (Sugrīva) brought forth a sword, moving it with quick, close turns.
'29': >-
  Mahodara, of great speed, took up a sword together with a shield; and likewise
  Sugrīva, foremost of vānaras and swifter still, seized a great sword along
  with a shield that had fallen there.
'30': >-
  Then, their bodies enveloped in rage, they roared and rushed at one
  another—swords raised, exultant in battle, both skilled in weapons.
'31': >-
  Both swiftly circled to the right, each fiercely angered at the other, each
  intent upon victory.
'32': >-
  That hero Mahodara, of great speed, boastful of his prowess, and evil-minded,
  brought his sword down upon Sugrīva’s mighty armor.
'33': >-
  As Mahodara drew back his sword after it had stuck fast, the bull among
  monkeys struck with his own sword and severed his head, with helmet and
  earrings upon it.
'34': >-
  When his head was cut off and he fell upon the earth, then that force of the
  rākṣasa king was no longer seen there (it broke and vanished).
'35': >-
  Having slain him, the monkey, together with the vānaras, roared in joy.
  Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa) was enraged, and Rāghava (Rāma) appeared delighted.
'36': >-
  All the rākṣasas, faces downcast and hearts despondent, fled then—every one of
  them, their minds terrified by fear.
'37': >-
  When Mahodara was felled upon the ground like a portion of a great mountain
  scattered down, the son of the Sun (Sugrīva) shone there with splendor—like
  the sun itself, unassailable by its own radiance.
'38': >-
  Then the lord of the vānaras, having attained victory at the forefront of
  battle, was gazed upon—by hosts of devas, siddhas, and yakṣas, and by
  companies of beings on the earth—who were filled with tumultuous joy.
'39': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-eighth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Slaying of Mahodara.”
