'0': >-
  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-nineteenth sarga, called “The Entry into the Fire (Hutāśana).”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed, Vaidehī, hearing from Rāghava those harsh words—hair-raising
  and spoken in anger—was deeply shaken.
'2': >-
  The princess of Mithilā, in that great assembly of people, heard for the first
  time those dreadful words of her husband; and, overcome with shame, she bowed
  her head down.
'3': >-
  The daughter of Janaka, as though her very limbs were being pierced, wept
  profusely, as if wounded by those arrow-like words.
'4': >-
  Then, wiping her face wet with tears, she spoke to her husband in a trembling,
  faltering voice, slowly saying this:
'5': >-
  “Why, O hero, do you make me hear such words—unlike you, so cruel to the ear,
  so harsh—as though you were a common man speaking to a common woman?”
'6': >-
  “I am not such as you have understood me to be, O mighty-armed one. Accept
  conviction from me: by my own conduct alone I swear it to you.”
'7': >-
  “Because of the ways in which women may move among others, you suspect my
  lineage and my chastity. Abandon this suspicion, if indeed I have been tested
  and found true by you.”
'8': >-
  “That I came to be touched in my body, O lord, was against my will; there, no
  choice of mine was present—there destiny alone commits the offence.”
'9': >-
  “But what is under my control—my heart—rests in you. As for this body, held in
  another’s power, what could I, without sovereignty, do?”
'10': >-
  “O bestower of honour, if even through long abiding affection and through
  association you have not understood me, then by that I am slain forever.”
'11': >-
  “Hanumān, that great hero, was sent by you as a messenger to behold me. When I
  was in Laṅkā, O king, why was I not then abandoned by you?”
'12': >-
  “In the presence of this very Vānara, immediately after his words, had you
  cast me off, O hero, I would have abandoned my life at that very moment.”
'13': >-
  “Then your effort would not have been in vain; placing my life upon your
  doubt, the distress of your well-wishers would not have occurred, nor would
  this have proved fruitless for you.”
'14': >-
  “But you, O tiger among kings, following only wrath, have treated me merely as
  a woman—like a petty man—putting womanhood itself forward as the cause.”
'15': >-
  “My birth from Janaka—only spoken of as an account—and my arising from the
  surface of the earth; and my conduct, O knower of conduct—these things, though
  many, you have not kept in view.”
'16': >-
  “The giving of my hand in marriage was not duly honoured; my childhood was
  oppressed; and my devotion and good character—everything of mine has been set
  behind your back, disregarded.”
'17': >-
  So speaking, weeping, her words choked with tears, Sītā addressed Lakṣmaṇa,
  who stood wretched and absorbed in thought.
'18': >-
  “Make for me a funeral pyre, O Saumitri—this is the remedy for this calamity.
  Struck down by false accusation, I do not wish to live.”
'19': >-
  “Cast off in the assembly of people by a husband displeased with my virtues,
  what other course have I to go? I shall enter the fire of oblation,
  Havyavāhana.”
'20': >-
  Thus spoken to by Vaidehī, Lakṣmaṇa—slayer of foes’ heroes—was seized by
  intolerable anguish and looked toward Rāghava.
'21': >-
  Understanding Rāma’s intention, made known by his expression, the mighty
  Saumitri constructed the pyre, obedient to Rāma’s resolve.
'22': >-
  For at that time no one—friend or ally—was able to appease Rāma, who resembled
  Yama, the Ender of Time; nor could anyone speak to him, or even look upon him.
'23': >-
  Then Vaidehī, having circumambulated Rāma who stood with face cast downward,
  turned toward the blazing fire, Hutāśana.
'24': >-
  Having bowed to the deities and to the brāhmaṇas, the princess of Mithilā,
  with palms joined in reverence, spoke these words from near Agni:
'25': >-
  “As my heart never, at any time, turns away from Rāghava, so may Pāvaka,
  witness of the world, protect me on every side.”
'26': >-
  “As Rāghava knows me—pure in conduct—not wicked, so may Pāvaka, witness of the
  world, protect me on every side.”
'27': >-
  “As by deed, by mind, and by speech I do not transgress against Rāghava, who
  knows all dharma, so may Pāvaka protect me.”
'28': >-
  “The blessed Sun, Vāyu, the quarters of space, the Moon likewise; and day as
  well as twilight, and night, and the earth—just as these and others know me to
  be endowed with chastity, so may it be (witnessed).”
'29': >-
  Having thus spoken, Vaidehī circumambulated the fire and entered the blazing
  flame, her inmost self without fear.
'30': >-
  And the vast multitude there—thronged with children and the aged—beheld the
  princess of Mithilā, radiant, as she entered Hutāśana.
'31': >-
  She, gleaming like newly refined gold, adorned with ornaments of heated gold,
  fell into the blazing fire in the sight of all the worlds.
'32': >-
  All beings then saw wide-eyed Sītā as she fell into Havyavāhana, shining like
  a golden altar.
'33': >-
  Ṛṣis, devas, and gandharvas beheld that most auspicious lady entering
  Hutāśana, as though she were the full oblation offered in a sacrifice.
'34': >-
  All the women cried aloud on seeing her fall into Havyavāhana—consecrated by
  mantras—like a stream of clarified butter poured in a rite.
'35': >-
  The three worlds—devas, gandharvas, and dānavas—beheld her, as though a
  goddess fallen from heaven, cursed, plunging into hell.
'36': >-
  As she entered the fire, a great cry of “Alas! Alas!” arose—an astonishing
  sound—among both the rākṣasas and the vānaras.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-nineteenth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the
  revered Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, named “The Entry into the Fire
  (Hutāśana).”
