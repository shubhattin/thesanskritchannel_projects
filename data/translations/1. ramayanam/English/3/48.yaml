  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, is the forty-eighth
  chapter, called “Rāvaṇa’s Boastful Vaunting.”
'1': >-
  As Sītā spoke thus, Rāvaṇa, enraged, with his brow knit into a frown, replied
  to her in harsh words.
'2': >-
  “I am the brother of Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera), O lady of lovely complexion; I am
  named Rāvaṇa—may good betide you—the mighty Daśagrīva (Ten-necked), full of
  prowess.”
'3': >-
  “Before whom the gods together with the Gandharvas, the Piśācas, the birds,
  and the serpents ever flee in fear, as creatures ever flee from Death.”
'4': >-
  “He by whom my brother Vaiśravaṇa, my half-brother, for another cause—out of
  wrath—was met in single combat, and, displaying valour in battle, was
  vanquished.”
'5': >-
  “Afflicted by fear of me, abandoning his own prosperous seat of power, that
  lord who rides in a man-drawn car now dwells upon Kailāsa, the best of
  mountains.”
'6': >-
  “And that auspicious chariot of the sky, named Puṣpaka, which moves according
  to desire—O gentle lady—was won by my might; by it I travel through the
  heavens.”
'7': >-
  “O Maithilī, merely beholding the face of me when my anger has arisen, the
  gods, with Indra at their head, flee away in terror.”
'8': >-
  “Wherever I stand, there the Wind-god blows with apprehension; and in heaven
  the scorching-rayed Sun and the cool-rayed Moon become so through fear (of
  me).”
'9': >-
  “Wherever I remain—whether standing or moving—there the trees are with
  unmoving leaves, and the rivers have waters stilled and motionless.”
'10': >-
  “Beyond the ocean there is my fair city named Laṅkā, filled with dreadful
  Rākṣasas, even as Amarāvatī belongs to Indra.”
'11': >-
  “Encircled by a lofty rampart, shining bright in its pale splendour, that
  delightful city has golden terraces and gateways made of vaidūrya
  (lapis/lustrous gem).”
'12': >-
  “Crowded with elephants, horses, and chariots, resounding with the blare of
  music and instruments, adorned with gardens thick with trees that yield every
  desired fruit—such is it.”
'13': >-
  “There, O Sītā, princess, dwell with me; O high-minded lady, you will no
  longer think of mortal women.”
'14': >-
  “Enjoying both human delights and heavenly pleasures, O fair-complexioned one,
  you will not remember Rāma, a mere man whose span of life is on the wane.”
'15': >-
  “Having installed his beloved son in the kingdom, King Daśaratha then, with
  his eldest son of feeble power, sent him forth to the forest.”
'16': >-
  “What will you do, large-eyed lady, with that Rāma—bereft of kingdom, his
  spirit cast down—living as an ascetic, a forest-dwelling tapasvin?”
'17': >-
  “Protect (i.e., accept) the lord of the Rākṣasas who has come of his own
  accord; you ought not to reject me who am pierced by Kāma’s arrows (inflamed
  by love).”
'18': >-
  “Rejecting me, O timid one, you will afterwards fall into remorse—like Urvaśī,
  who, as it were, struck Purūravas with her foot and then repented.”
'19': >-
  “Rāma is not equal to me even by a finger in battle—he is but a man. Since by
  your good fortune this (offer) has come to you, partake of it, O fair lady.”
'20': >-
  Thus addressed, Vaidehī, wrathful, her eyes reddened with anger, spoke harsh
  words to the lord of the Rākṣasas in that lonely place.
'21': >-
  “How, invoking (as your) brother that divine Vaiśravaṇa, to whom all the gods
  bow, do you desire to perform what is inauspicious and sinful?”
'22': >-
  “Surely, O Rāvaṇa, all the Rākṣasas will perish—those whose king is you, harsh
  and cruel, of evil understanding, with senses unconquered.”
'23': >-
  “After abducting Śacī, the wife of Indra, one might perhaps still live; but
  having brought me—the wife of Rāma—no one would remain in safety.”
'24': >-
  “Even if one were to live long after violating Śacī, the peerless in beauty,
  consort of the wielder of the thunderbolt—yet, O Rākṣasa, after assaulting one
  like me, there is for you no deliverance, not even though you should drink
  ambrosia.”
'25': >-
  Thus ends the forty-eighth chapter of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the original epic, entitled “Rāvaṇa’s Boastful Vaunting.”
