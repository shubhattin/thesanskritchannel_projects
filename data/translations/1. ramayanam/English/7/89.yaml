  Now begins the eighty-ninth sarga of the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Birth of Purūravas.”
'1': >-
  Hearing of the origin of the Kiṁpuruṣas, Lakṣmaṇa and Bharata then both said
  to Rāma, the lord of men: “This is indeed wondrous!”
'2': >-
  Then the righteous-souled Rāma, of great renown, once again narrated this
  account in full—concerning the son of Prajāpati.
'3': >-
  Seeing that all those Kiṇnarī women had fled in every direction, the best of
  sages addressed that beautiful lady, as though smiling in amusement:
'4': >-
  “O maiden of exceedingly lovely countenance, I am the dearly beloved son of
  Soma (the Moon). Choose me, O fair-hipped one, and seek me with devotion and
  with eyes softened by affection.”
'5': >-
  Hearing his words, in that solitary place, bereft of her own attendants,
  Ilā—she of radiant beauty—replied to that mighty captor:
'6': >-
  “O gentle one, I move as I please; yet I am under your sway. Command me, O son
  of Soma—do with me as you desire.”
'7': >-
  Hearing her words, marvelous in their import, he was filled with delight; and
  that lustful son of Candramas sported with her.
'8': >-
  To that lover, even the month of Mādhava (springtime) passed like a single
  moment, while he remained utterly absorbed in delighting Ilā of lovely face.
'9': >-
  Then, when that month had fully passed, the illustrious son of Prajāpati,
  whose face was like the full moon, awoke upon his couch.
'10': >-
  There he saw the son of Soma (Budha) performing austerities in a watery
  abode—standing with arms uplifted, without any support. The king addressed
  him:
'11': >-
  “Blessed one, I entered this difficult mountain fastness together with my
  followers, yet I do not see that host. Where, indeed, have my men gone?”
'12': >-
  Hearing the words of that royal sage, who had lost awareness of what had
  occurred, Budha replied with auspicious speech, consoling him with gentle and
  excellent words:
'13': >-
  “By a great shower of stones, your servants were struck down; and you, having
  fallen asleep at the hermitage-spot, were afflicted by fear from wind and
  rain.”
'14': >-
  “Be at ease—good be to you—fearless and free from fever. Living on fruits and
  roots, O hero, dwell here comfortably as you please.”
'15': >-
  Consoled by those words, that great-minded king then spoke again, deeply
  dejected because of the grievous loss of his servants:
'16': >-
  “I shall renounce my own kingdom; for I cannot even pass a moment when I am
  bereft of my attendants. O brahmin, you ought to grant me leave.”
'17': >-
  “My eldest son, devoted to dharma and of great fame, is known as Śaśabindu; he
  shall obtain my kingdom.”
'18': >-
  “For I shall not be able, having abandoned the wives of my servants—who lived
  in happiness—to address them, O great one, with even the slightest
  inauspicious word.”
'19': >-
  While the lord of kings was speaking thus, Budha said something most
  extraordinary, in a consoling manner: “Let your dwelling here be pleasing to
  you.”
'20': >-
  “Do not grieve, O son of Kardama, O mighty-armed one. After you have stayed
  here for a year, I shall bring about what is for your good.”
'21': >-
  Hearing that speech of Budha, whose actions are untroubled (unfailing), he
  resolved to reside there—just as the knower of Brahman had spoken.
'22': >-
  For one month he became a woman and Ilā continually delighted Budha; for one
  month, in the state of being a man, he cultivated a mind devoted to dharma.
'23': >-
  Then, in the ninth month, that fair-hipped Ilā bore a son to Soma’s son
  (Budha)—Purūravas, endowed with vigor.
'24': >-
  As soon as the child was born, the fair-hipped lady placed him into his
  father’s hands—Ilā set upon Budha’s hand that mighty son, radiant with a hue
  like his father’s.
'25': >-
  And Budha, possessed of self-control, having become a man again at the
  completion of the year, delighted him with narratives that were in accordance
  with dharma.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-ninth sarga of the Uttara Kāṇḍa in the sacred,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Birth of
  Purūravas.”
