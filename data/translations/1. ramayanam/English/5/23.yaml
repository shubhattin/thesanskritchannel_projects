  Now begins the twenty-third canto in the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Rākṣasīs’ Attempt to Persuade (Sītā).”
'1': >-
  Having thus spoken to Maithilī, King Rāvaṇa—the subduer of enemies—then issued
  commands to all the rākṣasī-women, and thereafter departed.
'2': >-
  But when the lord of rākṣasas had gone out and had again entered his inner
  apartments, those rākṣasīs of dreadful forms rushed together upon Sītā.
'3': >-
  Then, drawing near to Sītā, the rākṣasīs—overpowered by wrath—addressed
  Vaidehī in exceedingly harsh words, saying:
'4': >-
  “O Sītā, you do not greatly esteem the state of being wife to Rāvaṇa—the
  high-souled one, foremost of the line of Pulastya, the Ten-necked?”
'5': >-
  Then a rākṣasī named Ekajaṭā spoke these words, having summoned Sītā; her eyes
  were reddened with anger, and she was pot-bellied, with a broad palm-like
  belly.
'6': >-
  “Among the six Prajāpatis, this one is counted the fourth—Pulastya, renowned
  as the mind-born son of Brahmā.”
'7': >-
  “And Pulastya’s radiant mind-born son is the great seer named Viśravas,
  possessing a splendor equal to a Prajāpati.”
'8': >-
  “His son, O large-eyed one, is Rāvaṇa, the subduer of foes. You are worthy to
  become the wife of that lord of rākṣasas.”
'9': >-
  “O lovely-limbed one, why do you not consent to the pleasing words spoken by
  me?” Then the rākṣasī named Harijaṭā spoke.
'10': >-
  Opening her eyes wide in anger—her gaze like that of a cat—she said: “He by
  whom the thirty-three gods and even the king of the gods were conquered—”
'11': >-
  “—you are worthy to become the wife of that lord of rākṣasas: of that heroic
  one, intoxicated with prowess; of that valiant one who never turns back in
  battles; of that mighty one endowed with strength. Why do you not desire to be
  his wife?”
'12': >-
  “Casting aside his beloved, highly honored wives, the king of great
  might—Rāvaṇa—will come to you, O most fortunate one, above all of them.”
'13': >-
  “Leaving that inner palace, filled with a thousand women and adorned with many
  kinds of jewels, Rāvaṇa will come to you.”
'14': >-
  Then another rākṣasī named Vikaṭā spoke these words: “He by whose terrible
  prowess the nāgas, gandharvas, and dānavas have been conquered again and again
  in battle—he has come near to you.”
'15': >-
  “Why, O vile woman, do you not desire to be the wife of that high-souled
  Rāvaṇa, the lord of rākṣasas, who is possessed of every prosperity?”
'16': >-
  Then a rākṣasī named Durmukhī spoke these words: “He for whom the sun does not
  burn; whom the wind fears, so that it does not blow—O you with lovely
  outer-corners of the eyes—why do you not stand with him?”
'17': >-
  “From fear of him the trees pour down showers of flowers; the mountains stream
  forth water; and the clouds, too, do as he wills.”
'18': >-
  “O impassioned lady, why do you not set your mind upon becoming the wife of
  Rāvaṇa—of that king of the rākṣasas, that king of kings?”
'19': >-
  “Well have we spoken to you truly, O lady; well, O impassioned one. Accept
  this word, O you of gentle smile—otherwise it shall not go well with you.”
'20': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-third canto in the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Rākṣasīs’ Attempt to Persuade
  (Sītā).”
