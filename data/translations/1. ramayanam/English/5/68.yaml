  Now begins the sixty-eighth canto of the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The rendering of Hanumān’s words of reassurance.”
'1': >-
  Then I, being once again addressed by the Goddess, replied with due haste and
  respectful eagerness—honouring your affection, O tiger among men, and
  accepting it out of friendship.
'2': >-
  In this manner, Rāma, the son of Daśaratha, should be spoken to by you in many
  ways—so that, having slain Rāvaṇa in battle, he may quickly regain me.
'3': >-
  Or else, if you deem it fit, O hero, O subduer of foes—remain just one day,
  resting in some secluded place; tomorrow you shall depart.
'4': >-
  And for me also—ill-fated as I am—by your very presence, O Vānara, there would
  be for a moment some release from the ripened fruit of this sorrow.
'5': >-
  For if you, O valiant one, depart, intending indeed to return, even then there
  would be doubt for me about my very life-breaths—of this there is no
  uncertainty.
'6': >-
  The grief born of not seeing you would torment me all the more—me who has been
  overcome by sorrow upon sorrow, fallen into misery, and made a sharer in
  suffering.
'7': >-
  And this doubt too, O hero, stands as it were before me—mighty indeed, O lord
  of monkeys, are those helpers of yours among the monkeys and bears.
'8': >-
  How indeed will those monkey-and-bear armies cross the vast and hard-to-pass
  ocean—or how will those two sons of the foremost of men?
'9': >-
  For leaping across this sea, the power would belong only to three beings: to
  Vainateya (Garuḍa), or to the Wind-god, or to you, O blameless one.
'10': >-
  Therefore, in this undertaking—so difficult, O hero, and so hard to
  overstep—what resolution do you see? Tell me, O best of those who know the
  ways of action.
'11': >-
  Indeed, you alone are sufficient to accomplish this task, O slayer of hostile
  heroes; glorious is the rise of your strength.
'12': >-
  But if, with all the forces fully assembled, Rāma were to slay Rāvaṇa in
  battle and, victorious, lead me back to his own city—that would be
  fame-bestowing.
'13': >-
  Just as I was carried off from the forest by a rākṣasa through a deceitful
  stratagem—through fear of that very thing, so should Rāghava not act.
'14': >-
  But if Kākutstha, crusher of enemy power, having filled Laṅkā with his forces,
  were to lead me away—that would indeed be worthy of him.
'15': >-
  Therefore, bring about such an outcome that is in keeping with the valour of
  that great-souled one, that hero in battle.
'16': >-
  Having heard those words—spoken with humility, adapted to the purpose, and
  joined with reason—I then spoke in reply the remainder of my answer.
'17': >-
  O Goddess, Sugrīva—lord of the monkey-and-bear hosts, the best among leapers,
  endowed with steadfast might—has resolved firmly to act for your sake.
'18': >-
  Under his command stand the monkeys—rich in prowess, possessed of courage, of
  great strength—whose deeds answer to their very intentions.
'19': >-
  For them, their movement is not impeded above or below, nor sideways; and they
  do not falter in mighty undertakings, being of immeasurable splendour.
'20': >-
  Again and again, by those fortunate vānara warriors, endowed with strength and
  following the pathways of the wind, the earth has been traversed in
  circumambulation.
'21': >-
  And there are forest-dwellers there who are superior to me, and equal to me;
  none is inferior to me in Sugrīva’s presence.
'22': >-
  I have, at least, arrived here—what then of those of great might? For it is
  not the most excellent who are sent as mere envoys; rather, others are
  dispatched.
'23': >-
  Therefore, enough of anguish, O Goddess; let your wrath depart. With a single
  uprising, the leaders of the monkey hosts will reach Laṅkā.
'24': >-
  And those two—like the risen moon and sun—mounted upon my back will come to
  you, O greatly blessed one: those two man-lions.
'25': >-
  Swiftly you shall behold Rāghava—slayer of foes, lion-like in splendour—and
  Lakṣmaṇa too, bow in hand, arrived at the gate of Laṅkā.
'26': >-
  Swiftly you shall see the gathered vānara heroes—whose weapons are nails and
  teeth, whose prowess is like lions and tigers, resembling lordly elephants.
'27': >-
  Before long you shall hear the roar of the foremost monkeys—like mountains and
  like clouds—as they cry out on Laṅkā’s slopes and on the Malaya ranges.
'28': >-
  And swiftly you shall behold Rāghava—subduer of foes—with his forest-exile
  ended, together with you, anointed in Ayodhyā.
'29': >-
  Then, soothed and fully comforted by my auspicious, welcome, and heartening
  words, the daughter of Mithilā attained peace—she who had been so oppressed by
  excessive sorrow.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-eighth canto in the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Primeval Epic, entitled “The rendering of Hanumān’s
  words of reassurance.”
