  Then, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa, begins the sixtieth
  canto, named “The Dialogue between Aṅgada and Jāmbavān.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words of his, Vāli’s son (Aṅgada) spoke: “The two sons of the
  Aśvins—of great swiftness, mighty strength, and being foremost among leaping
  monkeys—…”
'2': >-
  “…through the pride arising from the boon bestowed by the Grandsire (Brahmā),
  they have attained the height of arrogance; for the Grandsire of all the
  worlds, in order to honour the Aśvins, …”
'3': >-
  “…formerly granted those two an incomparable invulnerability. Intoxicated with
  the pride of that boon, they routed a vast host (of enemies) …”
'4': >-
  “…and those two heroes of great might drank the nectar of the gods. These two
  alone, when angered, are able …”
'5': >-
  “…to destroy Laṅkā, together with its horses, chariots, and mighty elephants.
  Let all the monkeys stand still; even I alone am sufficient (to deal with)
  that city with its hordes of rākṣasas! …”
'6': >-
  “…to strike down Laṅkā swiftly, and also mighty Rāvaṇa. How much more (is it
  possible) if accompanied by heroes—strong and self-controlled? …”
'7': >-
  “By you, powerful monkeys, trained in the use of weapons and intent on
  victory—it is heard by us that Laṅkā was burned by the might of Vāyu’s son
  (Hanumān) alone. …”
'8': >-
  “(Yet) the Goddess (Sītā) was seen, but not brought back—thus to report there
  (to Rāma and the others) does not seem proper to me, (coming) from you who are
  famed for prowess. …”
'9': >-
  “For in leaping none (equals) you, nor in valour; in the worlds—even among
  gods and demons—none is your equal, O best of monkeys! …”
'10': >-
  “Having conquered Laṅkā with its hosts of rākṣasas, and having slain that
  Rāvaṇa in battle, we shall take Sītā and depart—our purpose accomplished and
  our hearts rejoicing. …”
'11': >-
  “When such rākṣasas have had their heroes slain thus by Hanumān, what other
  deed remains to be done here? Let us seize Jānakī and go! …”
'12': >-
  “Let us place the daughter of Janaka between Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. What is the
  use of all these deceits (or subterfuges) regarding those monkeys—those
  bull-like leaders among monkeys? …”
'13': >-
  “Indeed, we ourselves should go, slay those foremost of rākṣasas, and then be
  fit to behold Rāghava and Sugrīva together with Lakṣmaṇa. …”
'14': >-
  When he (Aṅgada) who had thus formed his resolve spoke, Jāmbavān—the foremost
  among monkeys—exceedingly pleased, and knowing the true purport, addressed him
  with words meaningful and apt: …
'15': >-
  “This is not sound counsel, O great-minded one—what you say, O mighty ape. We
  have been commanded to search the excellent southern direction, …”
'16': >-
  “…not to bring (her back). Neither by the lord of monkeys (Sugrīva), nor by
  wise Rāma, would it ever be approved that Sītā—though somehow won (back) by
  us—should be brought (in that manner). …”
'17': >-
  “Rāghava, tiger among kings, declaring his own lineage, the king himself,
  having made a vow beforehand, has vowed the recovery of Sītā. …”
'18': >-
  “How would he make his pledge false before all the foremost of monkeys? (Then)
  the deed done would become fruitless, and satisfaction would not be his. …”
'19': >-
  “And your valour too would have been displayed in vain, O foremost of monkeys.
  Therefore let us all go indeed to where Rāma is with Lakṣmaṇa—and mighty,
  radiant Sugrīva—to report this undertaking. …”
'20': >-
  “This intention is not proper for us in the way you perceive it, O prince.
  Rather, as Rāma’s intention is firmly set, so should you look to the
  accomplishment of the task (in accordance with it).”
'21': >-
  Thus ends the sixtieth canto of Sundara-kāṇḍa in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primordial epic, named “The Dialogue between Aṅgada and Jāmbavān.”
