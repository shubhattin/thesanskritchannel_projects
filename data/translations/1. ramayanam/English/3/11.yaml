  Now begins the Eleventh Sarga, named “Agastya’s Hermitage,” in the Aranyakanda
  of the holy Valmiki Ramayana.
'1': >-
  Then Rama went on ahead, while Sita—most fair—shone in the midst; and behind
  them followed Lakshmana, the bow in his hand, walking after his elder brother.
'2': >-
  Beholding various mountain-ridges and stretches of woodland, and diverse
  lovely rivers as well, the two went on together with Sita.
'3': >-
  They saw sarasa-cranes and chakravaka-ducks moving about on river-banks, and
  lakes filled with lotuses, thronged with water-born birds.
'4': >-
  They beheld spotted deer moving in herds, horned beasts maddened with rut, and
  buffaloes and boars, and elephants—foes to the trees—roaming about.
'5': >-
  Having gone a long way, when the sun was declining, they together beheld a
  charming lake extending for a yojana.
'6': >-
  It was thickly covered with lotus and water-lilies, adorned by herds of
  elephants, and crowded with waterfowl—sarasa-cranes, swans, and kadamba-ducks.
'7': >-
  In that lovely lake with clear waters there was heard a clamour of song and
  musical instruments, yet no one at all was seen there.
'8': >-
  Then, out of curiosity, Rama and Lakshmana the great charioteer began to
  question the sage named Dharmabhrit, a bearer of righteousness.
'9': >-
  “Hearing this most wondrous sound, O great sage, a great curiosity has arisen
  in all of us. What is this? Pray tell us truly.”
'10': >-
  Thus addressed by righteous-souled Raghava, the sage then promptly began to
  relate the marvel and power of that lake.
'11': >-
  “This is the ever-enduring lake called Panchapsaras, O Rama, brought into
  being by the austerities of the sage Mandakarni.
'12': >-
  “That great sage Mandakarni performed severe austerities—ten thousand
  years—living on air alone, in a reservoir of water.
'13': >-
  “Then all the gods, with Agni at their head, were distressed; and gathering
  together, they all spoke to one another.
'14': >-
  “‘This sage is seeking the abode of some one among us.’ Thus, with minds full
  of anxiety, all the dwellers in heaven were troubled there.”
'15': >-
  “Then, in order to obstruct his austerity, five chief apsaras, radiant as
  flashing lightning, were appointed by all the gods.”
'16': >-
  “Thereupon, by those apsaras the sage—knowing what is higher and lower—was
  brought under the sway of desire, so that the gods’ purpose might be
  accomplished.”
'17': >-
  “And those five apsaras came to be as wives unto the sage; and for them there
  was created in that very lake a dwelling, hidden from sight.”
'18': >-
  “There the five apsaras dwell at ease, delighting the sage—now in the bloom of
  youth—turning him away from the discipline of austerity and yoga.”
'19': >-
  “As they sport there, this sound of instruments is heard—mingled with the
  tinkling of ornaments—and the melodious strain of song.”
'20': >-
  Hearing these words of that contemplative sage, the illustrious Raghava
  accepted the account as a marvel, together with his brother.
'21': >-
  While thus speaking, he beheld the precincts of an hermitage, encompassed with
  kusha-grass and bark-garments, and graced with Brahman-like splendour.
'22': >-
  Entering there together with Vaidehi and with Lakshmana, Raghava—that scion of
  Kakutstha—came into that auspicious hermitage-enclosure.
'23': >-
  Dwelling there happily, honoured by great sages, he went, in due order, to the
  hermitages of those ascetics.
'24': >-
  Near those with whom that great master of weapons had formerly stayed, he
  abode—somewhere for ten months, and somewhere for a full year.
'25': >-
  In some places he stayed four months; in others five or six and more;
  elsewhere for still more months, and in some places for a year and a half and
  beyond.
'26': >-
  For three months, and for eight months too, Raghava lived pleasantly, dwelling
  among the sages in their hermitages.
'27': >-
  As he enjoyed himself in harmony with them, ten years passed by; and
  thereafter the righteous-knowing Raghava, with Sita, moved about further.
'28': >-
  He again came to the hermitage of Sutikshna. Arriving at that hermitage, he
  was duly honoured by the sages.
'29': >-
  There too Rama, the subduer of foes, stayed for some time. Then, while living
  in the hermitage, once—out of humility—
'30': >-
  the Kakutstha prince, sitting near him, spoke to Sutikshna these words: “In
  this forest, O Blessed One, Agastya, best of sages,
'31': >-
  is said to dwell—so I have ever heard in the talk of those who tell tales; yet
  I do not know his region, for this forest is vast.
'32': >-
  Where is the charming hermitage of that wise great rishi? For the grace of the
  Blessed One, I—together with my younger brother and with Sita—
'33': >-
  would go to Agastya, to pay reverence to the sage. This great desire
  continually turns within my heart—
'34': >-
  that I might myself serve that foremost of sages.” Hearing the
  righteous-souled Rama’s words, that sage—
'35': >-
  Sutikshna—answered the son of Dasharatha, pleased: “I too have been wishing to
  say this very thing to you, along with Lakshmana—
'36': >-
  ‘Go to Agastya, O Raghava, together with Sita.’ By good fortune you yourself
  now speak to me on this matter.
'37': >-
  I shall tell you, O Rama, where the great sage Agastya dwells. From the
  hermitage, dear child, go four yojanas; then, to the south, is the great and
  splendid hermitage of Agastya’s brother.
'38': >-
  It is in a region that is mostly level woodland, adorned with groves of
  pippali trees, charming with abundant flowers and fruits, and resounding with
  many kinds of birds.
'39': >-
  There are many lotus-ponds with clear waters, filled with swans and
  karandava-ducks, and beautified by chakravakas.
'40': >-
  Spending one night there, at dawn, O Rama, you should go on—taking the
  southern direction along the side of that forest tract.
'41': >-
  From there, going a yojana, you will reach Agastya’s hermitage, in a
  delightful woodland region adorned with many trees.
'42': >-
  There Vaidehi and Lakshmana will take delight with you; for that woodland
  region is charming, rich with many trees.
'43': >-
  If your resolve is made to see that great sage Agastya, O great-minded one,
  then approve the decision to depart this very day.”
'44': >-
  Thus hearing the sage’s words, and having paid reverence with his brother,
  Rama set forth with his attendants toward Agastya, together with Sita.
'45': >-
  Beholding diverse forests and mountains like masses of cloud, and lakes and
  rivers too—following the path as it led along—
'46': >-
  going pleasantly by that way pointed out by Sutikshna, Rama, exceedingly
  delighted, spoke these words to Lakshmana:
'47': >-
  “Surely this is the hermitage of that high-souled one—Agastya’s brother—of
  holy deeds, which is now seen here.
'48': >-
  For, as we have come through this forest, trees by the thousands along the
  path are bowed down under the weight of fruit and the burden of blossoms.
'49': >-
  And this fragrance—suddenly rising, with a sharp pungency—of ripe pippali
  fruits, has come from this forest, wafted by the wind.
'50': >-
  And here and there are seen heaps of gathered firewood; and darbha-grass,
  gleaming like vaidurya gems, appears as though cut down.
'51': >-
  And there, in the midst of the forest, like a peak crested with dark clouds,
  the column of smoke is clearly seen from the sacred fire of the hermitage.
'52': >-
  And at secluded bathing-places, twice-born men, having completed their
  ablutions, make offerings of flowers—blossoms gathered by their own hands.
'53': >-
  Therefore, O gentle one, according to the words of Sutikshna as I heard them,
  this indeed must be the hermitage of Agastya’s brother.
'54': >-
  For the welfare of beings, having restrained Death by his own might, this
  southern quarter was made a refuge by that holy doer—by whose brother this was
  accomplished.
'55': >-
  Here, it is said, once the cruel brothers Vatapi and Ilvala lived
  together—great asuras, slayers of brahmins.
'56': >-
  Assuming the form of a brahmin, Ilvala, speaking refined Sanskrit, mercilessly
  invited the twice-born—under the pretext of performing a shraddha.
'57': >-
  Then, having prepared his brother—making him assume the form of a ram—he fed
  those brahmins, observing the rites prescribed for a shraddha.
'58': >-
  After those brahmins had eaten, Ilvala spoke, raising his voice greatly:
  ‘Vatapi, come forth!’
'59': >-
  Then, hearing his brother’s call, Vatapi, bleating like a ram, burst
  forth—rending and rending the bodies of the brahmins.
'60': >-
  Thus, by those flesh-eating shapeshifters acting together, thousands of
  brahmins were destroyed continually.
'61': >-
  But then, at the request of the gods, that great rishi Agastya, at the
  shraddha, indeed ate that great asura.
'62': >-
  Then, saying ‘It is complete,’ and giving water for washing into his hand,
  Ilvala said again: ‘Let my brother come forth!’
'63': >-
  To that brahmin-slayer brother who was speaking thus, the wise Agastya, best
  of sages, spoke with a smile:
'64': >-
  ‘Whence is the strength to come forth—of the rakshasa now digested by me—of my
  brother in ram-form who has gone to Yama’s abode?’
'65': >-
  Then, hearing those words that signified his brother’s death, the
  night-ranger, out of anger, began to assail and violate the sage.
'66': >-
  He rushed upon that lord among the twice-born; but by the sage of blazing
  energy, with a gaze like fire, he was burnt up and met his end.
'67': >-
  This is the hermitage of his brother, beautified by tank and forest—by whose
  compassion for brahmins this difficult deed was accomplished.
'68': >-
  While Rama, together with Saumitri, was thus speaking, the sun set, and the
  time of twilight came upon them.
'69': >-
  Having duly worshipped the western twilight with his brother according to
  rule, he entered that hermitage-ground and paid reverence to that rishi.
'70': >-
  Duly received by that sage, Raghava spent that one night there, having eaten
  roots and fruits.
'71': >-
  When that night had passed and the circle of the sun had arisen, Raghava took
  leave of that brother of Agastya.
'72': >-
  “I bow to you, O Blessed One. I have spent the night in comfort. I take my
  leave—I go to see your elder brother, my guru.”
'73': >-
  Told by him, “Go,” the delight of the Raghus set forth, by the path indicated,
  gazing upon that forest as he went.
'74': >-
  He saw nivara grasses, jackfruit trees, sal trees, vanjula and tinisha trees,
  and chiribillva, madhuka, bilva, and tinduka as well.
'75': >-
  Adorned with flowering creepers whose tips were in bloom, Rama beheld, by the
  hundreds, the trees of that wilderness.
'76': >-
  Some were trampled by the hands of elephants; others were made splendid by
  monkeys; and in hundreds they resounded with flocks of intoxicated birds.
'77': >-
  Then Rama, lotus-eyed, spoke to the hero Lakshmana—enhancer of fortune—who was
  following close behind:
'78': >-
  “The trees are of glossy leaves; the deer and birds are as though patient and
  unafraid. The hermitage of that great rishi of disciplined soul is not far
  away.
'79': >-
  Agastya is renowned in the world by his own deeds; and his hermitage is
  seen—removing weariness from the weary.
'80': >-
  Abounding in dense smoke, and decked with garlands of bark-garments, with
  herds of gentle animals at rest, and echoing with many kinds of birds—
'81': >-
  by whose holy deed, desiring the welfare of the worlds, Death was checked by
  force, and the southern quarter was made a refuge—
'82': >-
  this is his hermitage-ground, by whose power this southern region, in fear of
  rakshasas, is seen yet is not harried.
'83': >-
  From the time this quarter was brought under the sway of that holy doer, from
  that time the night-rangers have become calm and without enmity.
'84': >-
  And this southern quarter is renowned by name as ‘the Blessed One’s rightward
  course’—famed in the three worlds, hard to assail even by those of cruel
  deeds.
'85': >-
  That best of mountains, the Vindhya, ever seeking to obstruct the path of the
  Sun, does not increase—keeping to the command of Agastya.
'86': >-
  This is the splendid hermitage of that long-lived Agastya, whose deeds are
  famed in the world, frequented by gentle and well-trained animals.
'87': >-
  This virtuous one, worshipped by the worlds, ever devoted to the good of the
  righteous—having found us come here, will unite us with what is best.
'88': >-
  Here I shall propitiate that great sage Agastya; and for the remainder of the
  forest-dwelling, O gentle one, I shall live here, O lord.
'89': >-
  Here gods with gandharvas, siddhas, and supreme rishis, restrained in diet,
  constantly attend upon Agastya.
'90': >-
  Here no liar can live, nor one who is cruel or deceitful, nor a violent and
  sinful-natured man—such is this rishi.
'91': >-
  Here gods and yakshas, and nagas together with birds, dwell—restrained in diet
  and intent on worshipping Dharma.
'92': >-
  Here great-souled siddhas—supreme rishis—leaving their bodies, attain heaven
  in aerial cars like the sun, taking on new bodies.
'93': >-
  Yaksha-hood, and even godhood, and various kingdoms—these the gods grant here,
  being worshipped with auspicious offerings and beings.
'94': >-
  “We have arrived at the hermitage-ground, O Saumitri. Enter first, and inform
  the rishi that I have come, together with Sita.”
'95': >-
  Thus ends the Eleventh Sarga, named “Agastya’s Hermitage,” in the Aranyakanda
  of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the primeval epic.
