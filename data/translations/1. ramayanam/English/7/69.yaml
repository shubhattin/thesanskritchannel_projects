  Now begins the sixty-ninth sarga (chapter), named “The Slaying of Lavaṇa,” in
  the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Hearing those words spoken by the great-souled Śatrughna, Lavaṇa was seized by
  a fierce wrath and exclaimed, “Stand! Stand!”
'2': >-
  Clenching his fists—pressing palm against palm—and grinding his teeth with a
  harsh clatter, Lavaṇa repeatedly challenged that tiger among the Raghus.
'3': >-
  As Lavaṇa, terrible to behold, spoke thus, Śatrughna—slayer of the foes of the
  gods—addressed him with these words:
'4': >-
  “Śatrughna is not one to be conquered as others have been conquered by you.
  Therefore, today, struck down by my arrows, go you to the abode of Yama.”
'5': >-
  “Let the sages today behold you, wicked-souled one, slain by me in battle—just
  as learned brāhmaṇas and the gods beheld Rāvaṇa.”
'6': >-
  “When you, O night-ranger, are burned through by my arrows and fall today,
  there shall indeed be safety for city and countryside alike.”
'7': >-
  “Today the arrow released from my arm, with a face like a thunderbolt, shall
  enter your heart—like the sun’s ray, born of the Sun, entering the lotus.”
'8': >-
  Thus addressed, Lavaṇa, maddened by anger, uprooted a great tree and hurled it
  at Śatrughna’s chest; but he cut it into a hundred pieces.
'9': >-
  Seeing that his deed had come to naught, the mighty rākṣasa, once again,
  seized very many trees and flung them at Śatrughna.
'10': >-
  And the radiant Śatrughna, as many trees came rushing toward him, cut each one
  down with three or four arrows, whose joints were unbent and firm.
'11': >-
  Then Śatrughna, endowed with heroism, showered a rain of arrows upon the
  rākṣasa’s chest; yet that rākṣasa was not shaken.
'12': >-
  Thereupon Lavaṇa laughed aloud; and, powerful in might, he lifted up a tree
  and struck the valiant hero upon the head. His limbs slackened, and he fell
  into a swoon.
'13': >-
  When that hero had fallen, a great cry of anguish arose among the sages, the
  hosts of gods, and likewise among the gandharvas and the apsarases.
'14': >-
  But the rākṣasa, slighting Śatrughna as though he were slain and cast upon the
  ground, even though he had gained an opening, did not enter his own dwelling.
'15': >-
  Nor did he seize his great spear on seeing him lying on the earth. Then,
  thinking, “He is slain,” he began to bring together those creatures as food.
'16': >-
  After a brief while, regaining consciousness, Śatrughna stood again, grasping
  his weapon, at the gate of the city, honored by the sages.
'17': >-
  Then he took up that supreme, divine, unfailing arrow—blazing with dreadful
  radiance, filling the ten directions with its splendor.
'18': >-
  It had a thunderbolt-like point and the speed of a thunderbolt, resembling
  Meru and Mandara; unbent at all its joints and unconquered in battles.
'19': >-
  Smeared as though with blood and sandal, bearing lovely feathers, winged; a
  rending weapon against the lords of dānavas, against mountain-kings, and
  against the asuras.
'20': >-
  Beholding it like the fire of Time ignited at the end of an age, all beings
  were seized with terror.
'21': >-
  The whole world—with gods, asuras, and gandharvas, with sages and hosts of
  apsarases—became distressed, as though the Grandsire (Brahmā) himself had
  arrived.
'22': >-
  Then they spoke to the God of gods, the Bestower of boons, the
  Great-grandsire: “A fearful bewilderment has come upon the gods, as though the
  worlds were moving toward destruction.”
'23': >-
  “Such a thing has never before been seen, nor heard of, O Great-grandsire: a
  fearful bewilderment has come upon the gods, as though the worlds were moving
  toward destruction.”
'24': >-
  Hearing their words, Brahmā, the Grandsire of the worlds—he who removes fear
  for the worlds—declared the cause of their fear, and spoke in a sweet voice:
  “Hear, all you deities.”
'25': >-
  “This arrow, held by Śatrughna, is for the slaying of Lavaṇa in battle. By its
  radiance we all, even the best of the suras, have been confounded.”
'26': >-
  “This is the ancient, primeval arrow, made of pure energy, belonging to the
  former God, the eternal Creator of the worlds—by which this fear has arisen,
  dear ones.”
'27': >-
  “This great arrow was created by that great-souled One for the sake of slaying
  the two daityas, Madhu and Kaiṭabha.”
'28': >-
  “Only Viṣṇu knows this arrow formed of pure radiance; this indeed is the
  former body (manifest form) of that great-souled Viṣṇu.”
'29': >-
  “Go from here and behold Lavaṇa, the foremost of rākṣasas, being slain by the
  great-souled hero, Rāma’s younger brother.”
'30': >-
  Hearing these words of the God of gods, the devas went to the place where
  Śatrughna and Lavaṇa, both, were fighting.
'31': >-
  All beings beheld that arrow, brilliant and divine in appearance, held in
  Śatrughna’s hand, risen like the fire at the end of time.
'32': >-
  Seeing the sky covered with gods, the delight of the Raghus gave a mighty
  lion-roar and again observed the favorable sign.
'33': >-
  And again challenged by that great-souled Śatrughna, Lavaṇa—filled with
  wrath—came forward for battle.
'34': >-
  Then that best of bowmen drew his bow to the ear, and released that great
  arrow into the broad chest of Lavaṇa.
'35': >-
  Tearing open his chest swiftly, it plunged down into Rasātala (the nether
  regions).
'36': >-
  Having gone to Rasātala, that divine arrow, honored by the gods, quickly
  returned again to Śatrughna, the delight of the Ikṣvāku line.
'37': >-
  Pierced through by Śatrughna’s arrow, Lavaṇa the night-ranger suddenly fell to
  the ground, like a mountain struck by a thunderbolt.
'38': >-
  And that great spear, with Lavaṇa the rākṣasa slain, in the sight of all the
  gods, came under the control of Rudra (Śiva).
'39': >-
  Having felled him utterly with a single shaft, that foremost hero of the Raghu
  line—possessed of the finest bow and arrows—shone forth, dispelling darkness
  like the thousand-rayed Sun.
'40': >-
  Then the gods, the sages, and the nāgas, and all the apsarases, duly honored
  him: “By good fortune victory has been attained by the son of Daśaratha.”
  Casting off fear, he became calm, like a serpent that has shed its terror and
  grown tranquil.
'41': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-ninth sarga, named “The Slaying of Lavaṇa,” in the Uttara
  Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya (first epic).
