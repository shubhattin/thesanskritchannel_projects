  Now begins the thirty-third canto of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Words of the Citizens.”
'1': >-
  Having given, along with Vaidehī (Sītā), abundant wealth unto the brāhmaṇas,
  the two scions of Raghu—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—went forth with Sītā to behold their
  father.
'2': >-
  Then, their weapons, borne by attendants, shone resplendent; and they
  themselves were adorned—garlanded and wearing auspicious ornaments—Sītā having
  also decked them with fitting embellishments.
'3': >-
  Thereafter, mounting the terraces of palaces and lofty mansions, and climbing
  even to the tops of aerial chariots (pavilions and upper galleries), the noble
  citizens, in sorrowful silence, looked on.
'4': >-
  For the streets could not at all be traversed, being thronged with multitudes.
  Therefore, the people, afflicted and wretched, climbed up upon the palace-tops
  and from there beheld Rāghava.
'5': >-
  Seeing him on foot, together with his younger brother, and with Sītā beside
  him, many people then spoke many words, their hearts struck down by grief.
'6': >-
  He whom, when he went forth, a vast fourfold army used to follow—him now,
  going alone with Sītā, did Lakṣmaṇa alone follow.
'7': >-
  Though a knower of the taste of sovereignty and a great accomplisher of all
  desired enjoyments, he nevertheless would not consent to make his word untrue,
  out of reverence for dharma.
'8': >-
  She who formerly could not be seen even by beings that move through the
  sky—today that very Sītā do the people, standing on the royal highway, behold.
'9': >-
  Sītā, fit to be anointed with fragrant unguents, who was wont to use red
  sandal-paste—will she not quickly be brought to pallor by the heat of summer
  and the cold of winter?
'10': >-
  Surely today Daśaratha speaks as though possessed of no true steadfastness;
  for a king ought not to banish his dear son.
'11': >-
  How indeed could there be banishment even of a son devoid of merit? How much
  less of him by whose conduct alone this whole world has been won over!
'12': >-
  Harmlessness, compassion, learning, good character, self-restraint, and
  tranquillity—these six qualities adorn Rāghava, the bull among men.
'13': >-
  Therefore, by the injury done to him, the subjects are exceedingly
  tormented—like water-creatures in the hot season when the waters fail.
'14': >-
  All the world is pained by the pain of him, the lord of the world—just as a
  tree, rich in blossoms and fruits, suffers when its root is struck.
'15': >-
  For he, of great splendour, is the very root of men—the very essence of
  dharma; and other people are as it were his flowers, fruits, leaves, and
  branches.
'16': >-
  Quickly, like Lakṣmaṇa, together with our wives and kinsmen, we too shall
  follow him who is going—the very path by which Rāghava goes.
'17': >-
  Abandoning our gardens, our fields, and our houses, sharing one sorrow and one
  happiness, we shall follow righteous Rāma.
'18': >-
  With treasures dug up and taken along, with courtyards laid waste, with wealth
  and grain gathered up—yet with the very substance of our homes removed in
  every way—
'19': >-
  covered over with dust, forsaken by the household deities, overrun by
  scurrying mice, and filled with gaping holes,
'20': >-
  with water-jars and hearth-fires gone, lacking all sweeping and cleansing, and
  with offerings, sacrifices, recitations, mantras, oblations, and japa wholly
  discontinued,
'21': >-
  like dwellings broken by a time of famine, and with vessels shattered—let
  those houses, abandoned by us, be for Kaikeyī to occupy.
'22': >-
  Let the forest be as the city itself, since Rāghava goes there; and let the
  city, forsaken by us, become as a forest.
'23': >-
  Let all creatures with fangs abandon their dens; let deer and birds quit the
  slopes and hills; let even elephants and lions forsake their forests,
  terrified by fear of us.
'24': >-
  Let those (wild beings) come into the region we have left; and let them
  abandon the place that is served and inhabited—this land of gatherers of
  grass, flesh, and fruits, a country of serpents, wild beasts, and birds.
'25': >-
  Indeed let Kaikeyī, with her son and her kinsmen, take up what remains; as for
  us all—we shall dwell in the forest with Rāghava, content and at peace.
'26': >-
  Thus were many kinds of words, spoken by many sorts of people. Rāghava heard
  them; yet, having heard, his mind did not waver.
'27': >-
  But that righteous-souled one, whose stride was like that of an intoxicated
  elephant, again approached his mother’s palace, radiant like the peak of
  Kailāsa.
'28': >-
  Entering the royal dwelling, filled with disciplined heroes and noble men, he
  saw Sumantra standing nearby, downcast and dejected.
'29': >-
  Waiting for that distressed noble, himself wearing no look of distress, as
  though smiling, Rāma went forward—desiring to see his father and to carry out,
  in due manner, his father’s command.
'30': >-
  Before that, however, the great-souled Rāma, son of the Ikṣvāku line,
  intending to go to the king who wore a sorrowful aspect, paused then on seeing
  Sumantra—so that he might send him in first to announce him to his noble
  father.
'31': >-
  And Rāghava, devoted to dharma and loving righteousness, having firmly
  resolved—by his father’s command—to enter the forest, on seeing Sumantra
  spoke: “Announce my arrival to the king.”
'32': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-third canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Words of the
  Citizens.”
