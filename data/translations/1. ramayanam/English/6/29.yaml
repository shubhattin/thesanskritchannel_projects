  Now begins the twenty-ninth canto in the War-section of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Dispatching of Spies such as Śārdūla.”
'1': >-
  But when Rāvaṇa saw those leaders of the monkey-hosts—together with Lakṣmaṇa
  of great prowess, the right arm of Rāma—whom Śuka had described to him,
'2': >-
  and Vibhīṣaṇa also, the brother of Rāma, standing near him; and Sugrīva, the
  king of all the Vānara-s, terrible in his onrush,
'3': >-
  and mighty Aṅgada, the grandson of him whose hand was as the thunderbolt
  (Indra), the son of Vāli; and Hanumān, the valiant; and Jāmbavān, the
  invincible,
'4': >-
  and Suṣeṇa, Kumuda, Nīla, and Nala, the bull among monkeys; and Gaja, Gavākṣa,
  Śarabha, and also Mainda and Dvivida,
'5': >-
  Rāvaṇa, somewhat untroubled at heart yet with anger newly risen, rebuked those
  two heroes—Śuka and Sāraṇa—when their account was ended.
'6': >-
  With their faces cast down, the two bowed low; and he addressed Śuka and
  Sāraṇa in a voice choked with wrath—agitated, harsh likewise.
'7': >-
  “It is not at all fitting for ministers and dependents to speak what is
  displeasing to the king—whether by restraining or by pressing their lord.
'8': >-
  “And when enemies, hostile and advancing for battle, are at hand, it is not
  fitting for you two to speak untimely praise of them.
'9': >-
  “Teachers, preceptors, and elders have been served by you in vain, since the
  essence of the treatises on kingship—which should be taken up and followed—is
  not grasped.
'10': >-
  “A burden is borne—either taken up without understanding, or not discerned at
  all—(such is your counsel). Fortunate indeed am I, it seems, to be served by
  such foolish ministers!”
'11': >-
  “Have you no fear of death, that you utter harsh words to me—when, as I
  command, my tongue can bestow what is auspicious or inauspicious (for you)?”
'12': >-
  “Even trees, when touched by fire, still stand in the forest; but men touched
  by the king’s rod do not stand—though they be without offence.”
'13': >-
  “I would slay these two sinners, who praise the enemy’s side, if my anger did
  not soften because of your former services to me.
'14': >-
  “Begone! Perish! Get away from my presence! I do not wish to kill you, for I
  remember the help you rendered me. Yet you two are ingrates; your hearts have
  turned away from affection towards me—(and) you are as though already slain.”
'15': >-
  Thus addressed, Śuka and Sāraṇa, abashed, looked on Rāvaṇa; then, acclaiming
  him with cries of “Victory!”, they withdrew.
'16': >-
  Then the ten-necked one said to Mahodara, who stood near: “Quickly produce my
  spies.” Thus spoken to, Mahodara swiftly commanded that the spies be brought.
'17': >-
  Thereupon the spies, hastening at the king’s command, arrived; and standing
  with joined palms, they offered blessings invoking victory.
'18': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa, lord of the Rākṣasa-s, spoke these words to them—spies who were
  trustworthy, heroic, steadfast, and free from fear:
'19': >-
  “Go from here and examine Rāma’s intentions and undertakings—(and learn) those
  who are inwardly with him in counsel, who have come to him out of affection.
'20': >-
  “How he sleeps, how he wakes, and what he will do today—having learned all
  this skillfully and completely, you must return, without leaving out
  anything.”
'21': >-
  “When an enemy is known through spies, wise lords of the earth, with but
  little effort, encounter him in battle and drive him away.”
'22': >-
  The spies, thus commanded, saying “So be it,” delighted Rāvaṇa, the lord of
  the Rākṣasa-s; placing Śārdūla in front, they then made a circumambulation (of
  the king).
'23': >-
  Then those spies, having circumambulated that great-souled foremost of
  Rākṣasa-s, went to where Rāma was, together with Lakṣmaṇa.
'24': >-
  Going near Mount Suvela, they saw Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—concealed (as they
  were)—along with Sugrīva and Vibhīṣaṇa.
'25': >-
  But as they looked upon that army, they became distressed with fear. Those
  Rākṣasa-s were seen (there) by the lord of the Rākṣasa-s, righteous-souled
  (Vibhīṣaṇa).
'26': >-
  Then, there on the spot, by chance, they were seized by Vibhīṣaṇa. Only
  Śārdūla was taken hold of, saying, “This one is a sinner,” (so spoke) the
  Rākṣasa.
'27': >-
  He too was released by Rāma when the monkeys were slaying him; and by Rāma,
  through compassion, the other Rākṣasa-s were also released.
'28': >-
  But harried by the monkeys—valiant and swift in prowess—they returned again to
  Laṅkā, panting and bewildered, their senses lost.
'29': >-
  Then those spies—night-ranging Rākṣasa-s, ever moving outside (on
  missions)—came before the ten-necked one, and, mighty though they were,
  reported to him the mighty army of Rāma, encamped near Mount Suvela.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-ninth canto in the War-section of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Dispatching of Spies such as Śārdūla.”
