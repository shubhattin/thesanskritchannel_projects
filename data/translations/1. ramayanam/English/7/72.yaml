  Now begins, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the
  seventy-second canto named “The Meeting of Śatrughna and Rāma.”
'1': >-
  Then sleep did not come to that tiger among men as he lay upon his couch, for
  he was pondering many matters and chanting the peerless song of Rāma.
'2': >-
  Hearing his exceedingly sweet voice, accompanied by the measured cadence and
  melody as of a vīṇā’s strings, the night swiftly passed for the great-souled
  Śatrughna.
'3': >-
  When that night had come to its end, having performed the morning rites in due
  order, Śatrughna, with joined palms, spoke these words to the foremost of
  sages.
'4': >-
  “O Blessed One, I desire to behold Rāghava, the delight of the Raghu race. I
  wish to take leave with your permission, together with these ascetics of
  well-observed vows.”
'5': >-
  Thus spoken to, Vālmīki embraced Śatrughna, the tormentor of foes, and then
  dismissed the Rāghava to depart.
'6': >-
  Having bowed to the best of sages, he mounted his splendid, radiant chariot
  and swiftly set out for Ayodhyā, eager for the sight of Rāghava.
'7': >-
  Entering that delightful city, the illustrious scion of the Ikṣvāku line—the
  mighty-armed one—went to the place where Rāma of great splendor was.
'8': >-
  There he beheld Rāma seated among his ministers, his face like the full
  moon—like Indra of a thousand eyes seated amid the immortals.
'9': >-
  Having saluted that high-souled Rāma, blazing as it were with spiritual
  radiance, Śatrughna, with hands joined in reverence, addressed him—Rāma whose
  valor is ever true.
'10': >-
  “Whatever was commanded, O great king, all that have I accomplished. That
  sinful Lavaṇa has been slain, and his city too has been founded and
  established.”
'11': >-
  “Twelve years have passed, O delight of the Raghu race, without you. I could
  not bear to dwell, O king, separated from you.”
'12': >-
  “Therefore, show me your favor, O Kakutstha, you of immeasurable prowess. Like
  a calf bereft of its mother, I cannot remain long away from you.”
'13': >-
  As Śatrughna spoke thus, Rāma embraced him and said this: “Do not give way to
  grief, O hero; such is not the conduct of a kṣatriya.”
'14': >-
  “Kings do not sink into despondency during separations, O Rāghava. Our
  subjects must indeed be protected according to kṣatriya-dharma, O Rāghava.”
'15': >-
  “From time to time, O hero, come to see me in Ayodhyā; and then, O best of
  men, you shall go again to your own city.”
'16': >-
  “You too are exceedingly dear to me—dearer even than life, without doubt. Yet
  the safeguarding of the kingdom must certainly be carried out.”
'17': >-
  “Therefore, O Kakutstha, dwell here for seven nights. Thereafter you shall go
  to Madhurā with your attendants, forces, and vehicles.”
'18': >-
  Hearing these words of Rāma—righteous and in harmony with his own
  heart—Śatrughna, in a subdued voice, replied only, “So be it.”
'19': >-
  And so, in accordance with Rāghava’s command, that great archer Kakutstha
  stayed there for seven nights, and then made preparations for his departure.
'20': >-
  Having taken leave of the high-souled Rāma, whose valor is ever true, and also
  of Bharata and Lakṣmaṇa, he mounted his great chariot.
'21': >-
  Śatrughna then swiftly went to his city, accompanied for a distance by the
  great-souled Lakṣmaṇa and by Bharata.
'22': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-second canto, named “The Meeting of Śatrughna and Rāma,”
  in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
