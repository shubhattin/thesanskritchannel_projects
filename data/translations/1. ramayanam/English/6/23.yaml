  Then, in the holy, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins
  the twenty-third chapter, entitled “The Besieging of Laṅkā.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, the elder brother of Lakṣmaṇa—skilled in discerning omens—having
  beheld the portents, embraced Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) and spoke these words:
'2': >-
  “Having taken up cool water, and seeing that the forests are rich with fruit,
  let us also distribute this host of forces, arrange them in battle-formation,
  and stand ready, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'3': >-
  “I perceive a dreadful fear that brings destruction upon the world, now
  present before us—a great tumult and stirring among the foremost warriors: the
  ṛkṣas (bears), the vānaras, and the rākṣasas.”
'4': >-
  “Winds, foul and dust-laden, are blowing, and the very earth trembles;
  mountain-peaks shake, and great trees fall to the ground.”
'5': >-
  “Clouds, resembling flesh-eating creatures, harsh and thundering with harsh
  sounds—cruel in aspect—are pouring down a dreadful rain mixed with drops of
  blood.”
'6': >-
  “The twilight is exceedingly terrible, appearing like red sandalwood; and this
  blazing orb of the sun seems to be falling down from the circle of fire.”
'7': >-
  “On every side, beasts and birds—wretched, crying in wretched tones and
  fierce—raise their clamour against the sun, producing great fear.”
'8': >-
  “The moon, giving no light in the night, scorches instead; ringed about with
  black and red rays, it has risen as though it were the very destruction of the
  world.”
'9': >-
  “A low, rough, inauspicious halo, red in colour, is seen; and in the clear sun
  a blue mark is visible, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'10': >-
  “The stars too are blotted out by a great dust-haze. Behold, O Lakṣmaṇa—these
  signs proclaim, as it were, the end-time of the worlds.”
'11': >-
  “Crows, hawks, and low-flying vultures are wheeling about; and jackals also
  utter inauspicious cries, exceedingly terrifying.”
'12': >-
  “With rocks, spears, and swords cast forth by the vānaras and the rākṣasas,
  the earth will be covered—turned into mire of flesh and blood.”
'13': >-
  “Therefore, let us swiftly—this very day—advance with speed against that
  unassailable city, guarded by Rāvaṇa, encompassed on all sides by all the
  Haris (vānaras).”
'14': >-
  Having thus spoken, that bow-bearing Rāma—he who is a crusher in battle—set
  forth in front, that mighty lord proceeding toward Laṅkā.
'15': >-
  All those foremost of vānaras, together with Vibhīṣaṇa and Sugrīva, set forth
  as well, roaring aloud, intent upon the slaying of the enemies whom they had
  resolved to destroy.
'16': >-
  And the Raghu-nandana (Rāma), for the sake of Rāghava’s beloved purpose, was
  greatly pleased by the actions and vigorous endeavours of the vānaras,
  abounding in valour.
'17': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-third chapter, entitled “The Besieging of Laṅkā,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic.
