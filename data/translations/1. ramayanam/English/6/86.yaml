'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  eighty-sixth chapter, named “The Slaughter of Rāvaṇi’s Forces.”
'1': >-
  Now, in that state of affairs, Rāvaṇa’s younger brother (Vibhīṣaṇa) spoke to
  Lakṣmaṇa words that were for the welfare of the others and conducive to
  accomplishing their purpose.
'2': >-
  “This array of rākṣasas that is seen—dark as a rain-cloud—let this be assailed
  at once by the monkeys, using rocks as their weapons.”
'3': >-
  “When this great host is broken, O Lakṣmaṇa, even the son of the lord of
  rākṣasas (Indrajit) will be seen here as one whose formation has been
  pierced.”
'4': >-
  “You, therefore, raining down upon the foes with arrows like Indra’s
  thunderbolt, rush swiftly—so long as this task is not yet brought to
  completion.”
'5': >-
  “Slay, O hero, that evil-souled one—supremely unrighteous, devoted to
  illusion—Rāvaṇi, of cruel deeds, a bringer of fear to all the worlds.”
'6': >-
  Hearing Vibhīṣaṇa’s words, Lakṣmaṇa of auspicious marks poured forth a rain of
  arrows against the son of the lord of rākṣasas.
'7': >-
  Bears and leaders of the monkey-host as well—warriors foremost among
  trees—charged together upon that stationed army.
'8': >-
  And the rākṣasas, with sharp arrows, with swords, with spears and javelins,
  advanced in battle, intent on slaying the monkey-army.
'9': >-
  Then a tumultuous melee arose between monkeys and rākṣasas, resounding with a
  mighty din and making Laṅkā ring on every side.
'10': >-
  With weapons of many forms—keen arrows, trees, and uplifted, dreadful
  mountain-peaks—the sky was covered over.
'11': >-
  The rākṣasas, with deformed faces and arms, striking the lords of the monkeys
  with their weapons, created exceedingly great terror.
'12': >-
  So too the monkeys, with entire trees and with mountain-peaks, struck down and
  slew all the rākṣasas in the battle.
'13': >-
  For the rākṣasas fighting there, great fear arose because of the foremost
  bears and monkeys—huge-bodied and mighty-strong.
'14': >-
  Hearing that his own host was despondent and being harassed by the foes, that
  hard-to-assail one (Indrajit) rose up, the task still unaccomplished.
'15': >-
  Coming forth from the darkness of the trees, Rāvaṇi, his wrath now kindled,
  mounted a ready chariot—previously yoked and well-controlled.
'16': >-
  Terrible with bow and arrows, resembling a mass of black collyrium, dreadful
  with blood-red mouth and eyes, he shone like Death himself—the Ender.
'17': >-
  Seeing him stationed on the chariot, that host of rākṣasas of frightful
  speed—desiring to fight with Lakṣmaṇa—turned about and gathered around.
'18': >-
  At that time, Hanumān—crusher of foes—tore up a huge tree, hard to withstand,
  resembling a mountain.
'19': >-
  That monkey, burning up the rākṣasa army like the fire of Time, with many
  trees rendered them senseless on the battlefield.
'20': >-
  Seeing the son of the Wind thus destroying them with impetuous force,
  thousands of rākṣasas showered weapons upon Hanumān.
'21': >-
  Some bore sharp tridents and struck with tridents; some were sword-wielders
  and struck with swords; some held spears and struck with spears; some were
  armed with battle-axes and struck with battle-axes.
'22': >-
  With iron bars and maces, with fair-looking lances, and hundreds upon hundreds
  with śataghnīs, and also with iron mallets,
'23': >-
  with dreadful axes and with bhindipālas, the rākṣasas struck—also with fists
  like thunderbolts and with palms resembling lightning.
'24': >-
  Closing in from all sides, they struck that mountain-like one; yet he too,
  enraged, wrought a great slaughter among them.
'25': >-
  Indrajit beheld the best of monkeys—Hanumān, son of the Wind—like an immovable
  mountain, fearlessly crushing his enemies.
'26': >-
  He said to his charioteer: “Go where this monkey is; for, if he is neglected,
  he will indeed bring destruction upon our rākṣasas.”
'27': >-
  Thus addressed by him, the charioteer went to where Māruti was, bearing on the
  chariot the supremely formidable Indrajit, steady and unassailable.
'28': >-
  Drawing near, that hard-to-overcome rākṣasa rained down upon the monkey’s head
  arrows, swords, battle-axes, and axes.
'29': >-
  Receiving those dreadful weapons, Māruti—overcome by great fury—spoke these
  words indeed:
'30': >-
  “Fight, if you are a hero, O son of Rāvaṇa, O evil-minded one. Having
  encountered the son of the Wind, you shall not depart alive to return.”
'31': >-
  “Fight with me hand to hand, if you seek a duel in battle. Endure my force, O
  foolish-minded one; then you will be foremost among rākṣasas.”
'32': >-
  Seeing Rāvaṇa’s son, bow in hand with arrows raised, intent on slaying
  Hanumān, Vibhīṣaṇa pointed him out to Lakṣmaṇa.
'33': >-
  “He who conquered Vāsava (Indra), sprung from Rāvaṇa’s own self—he it is,
  mounted upon his chariot, who seeks to slay Hanumān.”
'34': >-
  “With arrows of matchless form—foe-repelling, dreadful, bringers of life’s
  end—O Saumitri, slay Rāvaṇi.”
'35': >-
  Thus spoken to then by great-souled Vibhīṣaṇa, the terror of enemies, Lakṣmaṇa
  beheld him—mountain-like, stationed on his chariot, of dreadful might, hard to
  assail.
'36': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-sixth chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Slaughter of
  Rāvaṇi’s Forces.”
