  Now begins the eighteenth sarga, named “The Command for Exile to the Forest,”
  in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. [2.18]
'1': >-
  Then Rāma beheld his father seated upon an auspicious seat, dejected,
  wretched, and with his face dried up; and Kaikeyī was with him. [2.18.1]
'2': >-
  First, with humility, he bowed in reverence at his father’s feet; thereafter,
  composed and self-possessed, he also bowed at the feet of Kaikeyī. [2.18.2]
'3': >-
  The king, with eyes overwhelmed by tears, uttered only the word “Rāma”; but,
  miserable as he was, he could neither look upon him steadily nor speak
  further. [2.18.3]
'4': >-
  Seeing that unprecedented and fearful condition of the lord of men, Rāma too
  was seized with fear—like one who has touched a serpent with his foot.
  [2.18.4]
'5': >-
  He saw the great king sighing, his senses joyless, wasted by the burning
  torment of grief, and his mind distressed and bewildered. [2.18.5]
'6': >-
  He was like the ocean, garlanded with waves—unshakable, yet as though churning
  within; like the sun, as if eclipsed; like a sage who has spoken untruth.
  [2.18.6]
'7': >-
  Perceiving that inconceivable measure of sorrow in the king, Rāma became still
  more agitated—like the ocean at the time of the full tide. [2.18.7]
'8': >-
  Intent upon his father’s welfare, wise Rāma pondered: “Why is it that today
  the king does not greet me with joy?” [2.18.8]
'9': >-
  “At other times, even if my father has been angered, he becomes gracious on
  seeing me. Seeing me now, why has this distress arisen in him?” [2.18.9]
'10': >-
  Like one afflicted by grief, with a sorrowful countenance and luster dimmed,
  Rāma first saluted Kaikeyī and then spoke. [2.18.10]
'11': >-
  “Have I, through ignorance, committed some offence by which my father is
  angered? Tell me that; do you yourself bring him to tranquillity.” [2.18.11]
'12': >-
  “Why is he, whose mind is ever affectionate toward me, now displeased at
  heart—downcast, wretched—and why does he not speak to me?” [2.18.12]
'13': >-
  “Is he troubled by any bodily ailment, or any affliction of the mind? Or is
  there some distress or burning pain? For happiness is indeed not always easy
  to obtain.” [2.18.13]
'14': >-
  “Has anything inauspicious befallen prince Bharata of pleasing appearance, or
  Śatrughna of great prowess, or my mothers?” [2.18.14]
'15': >-
  “If I were not to satisfy the great king, or were to fail to carry out my
  father’s word, I would not wish to live even for a moment while the king is
  angered.” [2.18.15]
'16': >-
  “Since a man sees the very source from which his own existence has arisen
  here, how could he fail to serve it, when that divinity stands before him
  manifest?” [2.18.16]
'17': >-
  “Have you, from pride, spoken some harsh word to my father in anger, by which
  his mind has been wounded?” [2.18.17]
'18': >-
  “Tell me this truthfully, O queen, as I ask you in full earnestness: for what
  reason has this unprecedented change come upon the lord of men?” [2.18.18]
'19': >-
  Thus addressed by great-souled Rāghava, Kaikeyī—utterly shameless—spoke this
  bold speech, intent upon her own advantage. [2.18.19]
'20': >-
  “The king is not angry, O Rāma; nor has any calamity befallen him. But
  something in his mind—out of fear of you—he does not utter.” [2.18.20]
'21': >-
  “His speech does not proceed to tell you what is dear or what is not dear.
  Therefore you must do what I shall tell you—what he has not heard from me.”
  [2.18.21]
'22': >-
  “Formerly he bestowed a boon upon me, honoring me; afterwards the king now
  repents, like any ordinary man.” [2.18.22]
'23': >-
  “Having promised, ‘I shall give,’ the lord of men now wishes, uselessly, to
  build a dam after the water has already passed.” [2.18.23]
'24': >-
  “This, O Rāma, is rooted in dharma and is known even to the virtuous: the king
  should not abandon truth—though angered on your account.” [2.18.24]
'25': >-
  “Whether the king shall declare it as auspicious or as inauspicious, when you
  do everything accordingly, then I shall tell you again.” [2.18.25]
'26': >-
  “If what the king says to you will not come to ruin through you, then I shall
  state it; for he will not himself tell it to you.” [2.18.26]
'27': >-
  Hearing these words spoken by Kaikeyī, distressed Rāma said to that queen in
  the presence of the king: [2.18.27]
'28': >-
  “Alas, fie! O queen, you ought not speak such words to me. At the king’s
  command, I would even fall into fire.” [2.18.28]
'29': >-
  “I would eat sharp poison; I would even plunge into the ocean—if enjoined by
  my revered father, the king, who is also my benefactor.” [2.18.29]
'30': >-
  “Therefore tell me, O queen, what word of the king is desired. I shall do it—I
  vow it; Rāma does not speak twice.” [2.18.30]
'31': >-
  Then Kaikeyī spoke to Rāma—upright in conduct, though (in her intent)
  unrighteous—truth-speaking—words exceedingly dreadful. [2.18.31]
'32': >-
  “Formerly, in the war between the gods and the asuras, O Rāghava, your
  father—though wounded in that great battle—was protected by me, and two boons
  were granted.” [2.18.32]
'33': >-
  “There I have demanded of the king: the consecration of Bharata, and your
  departure today itself, O Rāghava, to the Daṇḍaka forest.” [2.18.33]
'34': >-
  “If you wish to make your father true to his vow, and (if you wish to guard)
  yourself, O best of men, then hear this word of mine.” [2.18.34]
'35': >-
  “Stand within your father’s command, as he has promised. You must enter the
  forest for nine years and five.” [2.18.35]
'36': >-
  “And Bharata should be consecrated—this consecration—which the king had
  arranged wholly on your account, O Rāghava.” [2.18.36]
'37': >-
  “For fourteen years, dwelling in the Daṇḍaka forest, abandon this
  consecration; become one who wears matted locks and bark-garments.” [2.18.37]
'38': >-
  “Let Bharata, son of the lord of Kosala, rule this earth—strewn with many
  kinds of jewels, and crowded with horses and chariots.” [2.18.38]
'39': >-
  “Therefore this king—overwhelmed with compassion, his face afflicted by
  grief—cannot look upon you.” [2.18.39]
'40': >-
  “Do this command of the lord of men, O joy of the Raghu race. By your great
  truth, O Rāma, deliver the king.” [2.18.40]
'41': >-
  While she spoke thus harshly, Rāma did not enter into grief; yet the mighty
  one was deeply pained, and the king too was scorched by the calamity that had
  befallen his son. [2.18.41]
'42': >-
  Thus ends the eighteenth sarga, named “The Command for Exile to the Forest,”
  in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the sacred Ādi-kāvya.
