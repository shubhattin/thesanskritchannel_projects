'0': >-
  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, is the
  seventy-first sarga, named “The Slaying of Atikāya.”
'1': >-
  Seeing his own forces shattered, in that tumultuous and hair-raising battle,
  and beholding his brothers—whose prowess was equal to Indra’s—slain,
'2': >-
  and also seeing his two paternal uncles struck down upon the field, and seeing
  those foremost of Rākṣasas—his brothers—mad with the frenzy of war and
  intoxicated with pride,
'3': >-
  Atikāya, of great splendor—holder of a boon granted by Brahmā in battle—became
  inflamed with wrath. Mountain-like in form, and a destroyer of the arrogance
  of gods and Dānavas, he blazed forth.
'4': >-
  Mounting his chariot, radiant like the massed brilliance of a thousand suns,
  that foe of Indra rushed upon the Vānara hosts.
'5': >-
  Then, stretching his bow with a mighty flourish, the crowned warrior with
  polished earrings proclaimed his name and roared with a great and dreadful
  sound.
'6': >-
  By that lion-like roar, by the proclamation of his name, and by the terrible
  twang of his bowstring, he struck terror into the Vānaras.
'7': >-
  Seeing the vast majesty of his body, the Vānaras, afflicted with fear,
  thought, “Kumbhakarṇa has risen again!” and all clung to one another for
  refuge.
'8': >-
  Beholding his form, like Viṣṇu in his Trivikrama stride, those Vānara
  warriors, in fear, scattered and fled in every direction.
'9': >-
  And those bewildered Vānaras, approaching Atikāya, sought refuge—refuge in
  battle—in Rāma’s younger brother, Lakṣmaṇa.
'10': >-
  Then the Kakutstha prince beheld Atikāya, stationed upon his chariot,
  mountain-like, a bowman, roaring from afar like a cloud at the time of
  dissolution.
'11': >-
  Seeing that enormous-bodied one, Rāghava was greatly astonished; and after
  comforting the Vānaras, he spoke to Vibhīṣaṇa.
'12': >-
  “Who is this, mountain-like, wielding a bow, with eyes like a lion, standing
  on a vast chariot yoked to a thousand horses?
'13': >-
  He shines, surrounded by sharp spears, keen lances and javelins, blazing—like
  Maheśvara encircled by spirits.
'14': >-
  He is resplendent, covered with chariot-spears that gleam like the tongues of
  Time—like a rain-cloud wrapped in lightning.
'15': >-
  And his bows, all around, ready and backed with gold, adorn that excellent
  chariot as the rainbow adorns the sky.
'16': >-
  This tiger among Rākṣasas, illuminating the battlefield, advances—the foremost
  of charioteers—upon a chariot with the splendor of the sun.
'17': >-
  With a banner set upon a lofty pole, shining like Rāhu, and with arrows whose
  radiance is like sunbeams, he makes the ten directions blaze.
'18': >-
  A bow, bent in triple curve, thunderous as a cloud, adorned with golden
  backing, and resembling the bow of Śatakratu (Indra), also shines in his hand.
'19': >-
  That great charioteer—bearing banner and pennons, with an attached drag-rope,
  equipped with four kinds of troops—resounds like the rumbling of
  thunderclouds.
'20': >-
  His quivers—twenty, ten, and eight—are mounted on the chariot; and there are
  dreadful bows, and bowstrings of golden tawny hue.
'21': >-
  Two swords also stand at his sides, blazing and adorning his flanks, with
  hilts four hands long, clearly fashioned, and broad as ten fingers.
'22': >-
  Steadfast, with a red-throated bowstring, like a great mountain; he is as
  Time, with a vast, Time-like mouth—like the sun within a cloud.
'23': >-
  He is adorned with arms bound in golden armlets, like Himavān, the best of
  mountains, with two lofty peaks like horns.
'24': >-
  With both earrings, his exceedingly fearsome face shines—like the full moon
  set amid the lunar mansion of Punarvasu.
'25': >-
  Tell me, O mighty-armed one, who this foremost of Rākṣasas is—seeing whom all
  the Vānaras, distressed with fear, have fled to the quarters.
'26': >-
  Thus questioned by Prince Rāma of immeasurable radiance, mighty Vibhīṣaṇa
  explained to Rāghava.
'27': >-
  “Daśagrīva’s younger brother—Vaśravaṇa’s (Kubera’s) younger brother—of great
  splendor, mighty in deeds, a great-souled one indeed, is Rāvaṇa, lord of the
  Rākṣasas.
'28': >-
  To him there was a valorous son, equal to Rāvaṇa in strength—one who served
  elders, who bore the sacred lore in memory, and who was foremost among all who
  know weapons.
'29': >-
  Skilled upon horse-back and elephant-back, with sword and bow, in drawing and
  aiming, in breaking the enemy, in conciliation and in gifts, in policy and in
  counsel—he is renowned.
'30': >-
  Leaning upon whose arm Laṅkā becomes fearless—him, the son of Dhānyamālinī,
  they know as Atikāya.
'31': >-
  By him was Brahmā worshiped with austerities by a disciplined soul; weapons
  too were obtained, and foes were overcome.
'32': >-
  Invincibility against gods and Asuras was granted to him by the Self-born; and
  this divine armor is his, and his chariot is radiant as the sun.
'33': >-
  By him hundreds of gods and Dānavas were defeated; the Rākṣasas were
  protected, and Yakṣas too were slain.
'34': >-
  By his arrows even the thunderbolt of wise Indra was checked; likewise the
  noose of Varuṇa, lord of waters, was repelled in war.
'35': >-
  This Atikāya is strong, a bull among Rākṣasas—wise, the son of Rāvaṇa, and a
  destroyer of the pride of gods and Dānavas.
'36': >-
  Therefore, O best of men, let effort be made against him swiftly, before he
  brings the Vānara armies to destruction with his shafts.”
'37': >-
  Then mighty Atikāya, entering the Vānara host, stretched his bow and roared
  again and again.
'38': >-
  Seeing that terrible-bodied one, seated on a chariot, the best of
  chariot-warriors, the great-souled leaders among the forest-dwellers rushed
  upon him.
'39': >-
  Kumuda, Dvivida, Mainda, Nīla, and Śarabha too—together charged, with trees
  and mountain-peaks in their hands.
'40': >-
  Their trees and rocks Atikāya—of great splendor, the foremost among those
  skilled in weapons—shattered with arrows adorned with gold.
'41': >-
  And that mighty, dreadful-bodied night-ranger pierced all those Vānara chiefs,
  charging toward him, with iron-pointed arrows in the fight.
'42': >-
  Tormented by a rain of arrows, their limbs torn and defeated, they were unable
  to counter Atikāya in that great battle.
'43': >-
  That Rākṣasa terrified the army of Vānara heroes, like an enraged lion, proud
  of youth, terrifying a herd of deer.
'44': >-
  Amid the Vānara troops the lord of Rākṣasas did not strike down any who were
  not fighting. Then, springing up, he faced Rāma—the bearer of bow and
  quiver—and spoke these proud words:
'45': >-
  “Seated on my chariot, with bow and arrows in hand, I do not fight with anyone
  ordinary. Let him who has power, endowed with resolve, grant me battle here
  today—swiftly!”
'46': >-
  Hearing those words as he spoke—wrathful and boastful—Saumitri, the slayer of
  foes, grew angry; unable to endure it, he sprang up, took up his bow, and
  then, smiling, replied.
'47': >-
  Enraged, Saumitri leapt forth, snatched a shaft from his quiver, and drew his
  great bow before Atikāya.
'48': >-
  Filling the entire earth, the sky, the ocean, and the quarters, the fierce
  twang of Lakṣmaṇa’s bowstring terrified the night-rangers.
'49': >-
  Hearing the dread sound of Saumitri’s bow, the strong, mighty son of the
  Rākṣasa king marveled.
'50': >-
  Then Atikāya, angered, seeing Lakṣmaṇa rise, took a sharp arrow and spoke
  these words:
'51': >-
  “You are but a boy, O Saumitri, unskilled in feats of valor. How is it you
  desire to fight me, who am like Time itself?
'52': >-
  Even Himavān cannot bear the rush of the arrows released by my arms—nor can
  the mid-air, nor the earth!
'53': >-
  You wish to awaken the fire of Time, sleeping in ease! Put down your bow and
  turn back; do not go to death upon coming against me.”
'54': >-
  “Or if, obstinate, you do not wish to turn back—then stand; abandoning your
  life, you shall go to the imperishable realm of Yama.”
'55': >-
  “Behold my sharp arrows that destroy the enemy’s pride, resembling the weapons
  of the gods, adorned with molten gold.
'56': >-
  “This arrow of mine, serpent-like, shall drink your blood—like an enraged
  lion, the blood of the king of serpents.” Having spoken thus in rage, he set
  that arrow upon his bow.
'57': >-
  Hearing Atikāya’s words—wrathful and proud—in the battle, the prince grew
  exceedingly angry; strong and high-minded, he then spoke words of great
  meaning.
'58': >-
  “Not by mere speech is one eminent, nor by boasting do men become noble. With
  me standing here, bow in hand and arrows ready, show your own strength, O
  wicked one!”
'59': >-
  “Prove yourself by deeds; you ought not to boast. He who is endowed with manly
  effort—he indeed is remembered as a hero.”
'60': >-
  “You are armed with every weapon, a bowman mounted on a chariot. Whether with
  arrows or with missiles, display your prowess!”
'61': >-
  “Then with sharp arrows I shall strike down your head—just as the wind knocks
  down a ripe palmyra fruit from its stalk.”
'62': >-
  “Today my arrows, adorned with heated gold, shall drink your blood from your
  body, rising up from within the wounds of arrow-shafts.”
'63': >-
  “Knowing me to be a boy, you must not despise me. Whether boy or elder—know
  death in battle!”
'64': >-
  “By the boy Viṣṇu the three worlds were traversed in the three strides of
  Trivikrama.” Hearing Lakṣmaṇa’s reasoned and supremely meaningful words,
  Atikāya became very angry and took up an excellent arrow.
'65': >-
  Then Vidyādharas, Bhūtas, gods, Daityas, great sages, and lofty Guhyakas came
  to behold that battle.
'66': >-
  Then Atikāya, enraged, fixed a shaft upon his bow and hurled it at Lakṣmaṇa,
  as though casting down the very sky.
'67': >-
  That sharp arrow, falling like a venomous serpent, Lakṣmaṇa—slayer of hostile
  heroes—cut in two with a crescent-headed shaft.
'68': >-
  Seeing that arrow severed, like a serpent with its coils cut, Atikāya,
  exceedingly wrathful, set five arrows on his bow.
'69': >-
  Those arrows the night-ranger shot at Lakṣmaṇa; before they reached, Bharata’s
  younger brother cleft them with keen shafts.
'70': >-
  Having cut them down with sharp arrows, Lakṣmaṇa, slayer of hostile heroes,
  took up a keen arrow, blazing as if with fire.
'71': >-
  Taking it, Lakṣmaṇa set it on his excellent bow; he drew it back with force
  and released the shaft.
'72': >-
  With that arrow—drawn to the full and released, with bent joints—he struck the
  foremost of Rākṣasas upon the forehead, he of great valor.
'73': >-
  That arrow, sunk in the forehead of that dreadful Rākṣasa, was seen smeared
  with blood—like the lord of serpents upon a mountain.
'74': >-
  Then the Rākṣasa trembled, sorely oppressed by Lakṣmaṇa’s shafts—like the
  terrible citadel of Tripura struck by Rudra’s arrow.
'75': >-
  Mighty Atikāya considered, steadied himself, and reflected: “Well done! By
  that fall of the arrow, you are a foe worthy of praise to me.”
'76': >-
  Thus resolving, grimacing, and restraining his mighty arms, he mounted the
  platform of his chariot and began to wheel about in his chariot.
'77': >-
  Thus, ‘three, five, seven’—taking arrows in such counts, that bull among
  Rākṣasas repeatedly set them on his bow, drew, and released them.
'78': >-
  Those arrows, like Time itself, released from the bow of the Rākṣasa
  prince—gold-feathered and sun-bright—made the sky appear as though aflame.
'79': >-
  Then Rāghava’s younger brother, unperturbed, cut down those volleys of arrows
  discharged by the Rākṣasa with many keen shafts.
'80': >-
  Seeing those arrows cut down in battle, the son of Rāvaṇa—foe of the lord of
  the gods—grew furious and seized a sharp arrow.
'81': >-
  Fitting it, that mighty one released the shaft at once; with it he struck
  Saumitri, who was approaching, in the middle of the chest.
'82': >-
  Struck in battle upon the breast by Atikāya, Saumitri’s blood flowed forth
  violently—like the must of an intoxicated elephant.
'83': >-
  Yet the mighty lord quickly made himself as though free of the arrow; then he
  took a sharp shaft and also grasped it with an astra (missile-incantation).
'84': >-
  Then he yoked that arrow with the Āgneya astra; and the shaft on the bow of
  the great-souled one blazed forth.
'85': >-
  Atikāya, of surpassing splendor, took up the Raudra astra; with it he fitted a
  serpent-like arrow with golden feathers.
'86': >-
  That dreadful, blazing missile—set upon the arrow—Lakṣmaṇa hurled at Atikāya
  like Death casting his staff of doom.
'87': >-
  Seeing the arrow joined with the Āgneya astra, the night-ranger then released
  a Raudra arrow, yoked with the Sūrya astra.
'88': >-
  Those two arrows met in the sky and struck one another, their tips blazing
  with radiance, like two angry serpents.
'89': Burning one another away, the two fell down upon the surface of the earth.
'90': >-
  Deprived of their flames and reduced to ash, those excellent arrows did not
  shine; though they had blazed, now upon the ground they no longer gleamed.
'91': >-
  Then Atikāya, enraged, discharged the Tvaṣṭra ‘Aiṣīka’ astra; but the valorous
  Saumitri cut down that missile with the Aindra astra.
'92': >-
  Seeing the Aiṣīka destroyed, the prince, the son of Rāvaṇa, in fury yoked a
  shaft with the Yāmya astra.
'93': >-
  Then the night-ranger hurled that missile at Lakṣmaṇa; and Lakṣmaṇa struck it
  down with the Vāyavya astra.
'94': >-
  Then, enraged, Lakṣmaṇa showered the son of Rāvaṇa with streams of arrows,
  like a cloud showering with torrents of rain.
'95': >-
  Reaching Atikāya’s armor—adorned like a thunderbolt—those arrows at once had
  their points broken and fell upon the earth.
'96': >-
  Seeing those arrows rendered futile, Lakṣmaṇa, slayer of hostile heroes,
  illustrious, showered him with a thousand arrows.
'97': >-
  Though struck by masses of arrows, mighty Atikāya—protected by invulnerable
  armor—did not waver at all in the battle.
'98': >-
  And he sent forth at Lakṣmaṇa a serpent-shaped arrow; pierced by it in a vital
  spot, Saumitri was struck.
'99': >-
  For only a moment the scorcher of foes became unconscious; then, regaining
  awareness, with four excellent shafts,
'100': >-
  that mighty one struck down the horses in battle, and the charioteer as well;
  and having torn down the banner, that subduer of enemies did so amid showers
  of arrows.
'101': >-
  Unshaken, Saumitri—Lakṣmaṇa—then released those well-aimed arrows, for the
  slaying of that Rākṣasa.
'102': >-
  Yet the best of men could not inflict pain upon him in battle. Then Vāyu,
  drawing near, spoke words to him:
'103': >-
  “This one has a boon granted by Brahmā and is covered by invulnerable armor.
  Split him with the Brahmā weapon—thus alone is he slayable, not otherwise.
  Armored and mighty, he is invulnerable to other missiles.”
'104': >-
  Hearing Vāyu’s words, Saumitri, whose valor was like Indra’s, took up an arrow
  of fierce speed and at once employed that Brahmā astra.
'105': >-
  As that supreme missile was being applied by Saumitri to the foremost
  sharp-pointed arrow, the directions, the moon and sun, the great ग्रह
  (planets/omens), and the sky trembled, and the earth groaned aloud.
'106': >-
  Yoking that arrow to the bow with Brahmā’s weapon—feathered, like a messenger
  of Yama—Saumitri hurled in battle that shaft, terrible as a thunderbolt, at
  that son of the foe of Indra.
'107': >-
  Then Atikāya in the fight saw that arrow, released by Lakṣmaṇa with
  ever-increasing speed, rushing on with the fierce velocity of the wind, with
  splendid variegated feathers like Suparṇa’s thunderbolt.
'108': >-
  Watching it, Atikāya at once struck it with many sharp arrows; but that shaft,
  with Suparṇa’s speed, veered aside with still greater swiftness.
'109': >-
  Seeing that arrow come—ablaze like the Time of death at the end—Atikāya,
  undismayed in action, struck at it with śakti-spears, lances, maces, axes,
  tridents, and arrows as well.
'110': >-
  Rendering those wondrously formed weapons futile, that
  arrow—flame-bright—caught the head of Atikāya, crowned with a helmet, and bore
  it away.
'111': >-
  That head, with helmet, crushed by Lakṣmaṇa’s shafts, fell suddenly to the
  ground, like a peak of Himavān.
'112': >-
  Seeing him fallen upon the earth, his armor and ornaments scattered, all the
  remaining night-rangers became distressed.
'113': >-
  Many, downcast and dejected, exhausted by the blows, cried out loudly at once
  in broken, discordant voices.
'114': >-
  Then the night-rangers fled from that place, heedless and afraid, running
  toward the city when their leader had been slain.
'115': >-
  Then many Vānaras, filled with delight, their faces like fully blossomed
  lotuses, honored Lakṣmaṇa—worthy of sacrificial shares—when the foe of
  dreadful and unassailable might had been slain.
'116': >-
  Having felled in battle the exceedingly strong Atikāya, cloud-like in form,
  Lakṣmaṇa rejoiced; then swiftly he went to Rāma’s side, being greatly honored
  by the multitude of monkeys.
'117': >-
  Thus ends, in the ancient and sacred Śrīmad Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic,
  in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the seventy-first sarga, named “The Slaying of Atikāya.”
