  Now begins the thirty-fifth canto of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Arousing of Trust (in Hanumān).”
'1': >-
  But Vaidehī, having heard that narrative of Rāma from the bull among the
  Vānaras, spoke these comforting words in a sweet voice:
'2': >-
  “What connexion hast thou with Rāma? How dost thou know Lakṣmaṇa? And how came
  there to be a meeting between the Vānaras and the men?”
'3': >-
  “The marks and tokens of Rāma, and also those of Lakṣmaṇa, O Vānara—declare
  them to me again, so that grief may not overcome me.”
'4': >-
  “Of what kind is his form and stature, and what is his appearance? How are his
  thighs, how his arms? And tell me also of Lakṣmaṇa.”
'5': >-
  Thus addressed by Vaidehī, Hanumān, son of Māruta, then began to describe Rāma
  truthfully and in accordance with reality.
'6': >-
  “By good fortune indeed, O Vaidehī, thou askest me of the bodily form of thy
  lord, O lotus-eyed one, and of Lakṣmaṇa as well.”
'7': >-
  “The marks of Rāma, and likewise those of Lakṣmaṇa, O large-eyed one—hear them
  from me as I declare them, even as I have observed them.”
'8': >-
  “Rāma is lotus-eyed; his face is like the full moon. Endowed with beauty and
  graciousness, he was born (as a joy) to thee, O daughter of Janaka.”
'9': >-
  “In splendour he is like the Sun; in forbearance he is equal to the Earth; in
  intellect he is like Bṛhaspati; in fame he is comparable to Vāsava (Indra).”
'10': >-
  “He is the protector of all living beings, and the protector of his own
  people. He is the guardian of his own righteous conduct and of Dharma itself,
  O scorcher of foes.”
'11': >-
  “Rāma, O fair one, is the protector of the fourfold order of society. He is
  the maker of the world’s bounds and proprieties, and also the one who causes
  them to be observed.”
'12': >-
  “Radiant, and exceedingly honoured, he abides in the vow of brahmacarya. He
  knows how to be of service to the good, and he knows the proper course of
  actions.”
'13': >-
  “He is disciplined in the science of kingship, and devoted to the service of
  Brāhmaṇas. He is wise, possessed of good character, and humble—O subduer of
  foes.”
'14': >-
  “He is trained in the Yajurveda and greatly revered by those who know the
  Vedas. He is firmly established in the science of archery, in Vedic learning,
  and in the Vedāṅgas.”
'15': >-
  “Broad-shouldered and mighty-armed, with a conch-like neck and an auspicious
  countenance; with his collarbones well concealed, and eyes tinged with
  copper—he is famed among men by the name ‘Rāma.’”
'16': >-
  “His voice resounds like the sound of a kettledrum; his complexion is smooth
  and pleasing; he is full of prowess. His limbs are well-proportioned and
  evenly shaped, and he bears a dark hue.”
'17': >-
  “He is ‘three-stable,’ ‘three-long,’ and ‘three-even,’ and in three respects
  he is tall; in three respects he is coppery-red, in three respects glossy, and
  in three respects ever deep (and grave).”
'18': >-
  “He is possessed of three folds (on the body), has three slight depressions,
  bears four distinctive features, and is ‘three-headed’; he has four lines
  (marks), four measures, and is fourfold in symmetry.”
'19': >-
  “He is balanced in fourteen pairs; has four tusks; has four modes of gait; is
  great in lip, jaw, and nose; is ‘five-glossy,’ and is ‘eight-jointed.’”
'20': >-
  “He has ten lotuses (marks), ten broad features; is pervaded by three, and has
  two points of whiteness; he is raised in six, has nine forms of slenderness;
  and in three ways does Rāghava pervade.”
'21': >-
  “He delights in truth and Dharma; he is illustrious; he delights in gathering
  and in showing favour. He knows the divisions of place and time, and his
  speech is dear to all the worlds.”
'22': >-
  “And his uterine brother, Saumitri, of immeasurable splendour, is of like
  nature—by affection, by form, and by virtues as well.”
'23': >-
  “That illustrious Rāma has a golden radiance though dark-hued, and is of great
  renown. Those two tigers among men are in festival of joy at the prospect of
  beholding thee.”
'24': >-
  “Seeking thee, they wander over the whole earth—having come into fellowship
  with us—those two, roaming the world in search of thee alone.”
'25': >-
  “There they beheld the lord of deer (the monkey-chief), who had been cast down
  by his elder brother, at the foot of Ṛṣyamūka, crowded with many trees.”
'26': >-
  “Suffering from fear of his brother, sat Sugrīva of pleasing aspect; and we
  too served that king of Vānaras—Sugrīva, steadfast in battle and true to his
  word.”
'27': >-
  “We attended upon him, who had been driven out of his kingdom by his elder
  brother. Then those two, clad in bark-garments, with excellent bows in their
  hands,”
'28': >-
  “came to that fair region of the mountain Ṛṣyamūka. Seeing those two tigers
  among men, bow-bearing, the bull among Vānaras,”
'29': >-
  “leaped up to the summit of that mountain, bewildered by fear. Then, standing
  upon that peak, that lord of Vānaras”
'30': >-
  “swiftly sent me alone to their presence. By Sugrīva’s command, I approached
  those two lords, tigers among men,”
'31': >-
  “endowed with noble form and marks; and, with palms joined, I stood before
  them. Understanding the truth of things, and filled with affection, I (too)
  was well disposed toward them.”
'32': >-
  “Taking me upon their back (in friendship), I brought those two best of men to
  that place, and I introduced them in truth to great-souled Sugrīva.”
'33': >-
  “From their mutual conversation, great joy arose. There those two—lord of
  Vānaras and lord of men—both endowed with fame,”
'34': >-
  “having given one another assurance by the tale of former events, then
  Lakṣmaṇa’s elder brother (Rāma) consoled Sugrīva.”
'35': >-
  “He had been cast out by his brother Vālin, because of a woman—though of great
  prowess. Then the sorrow of thy loss, born of thy destruction,”},{
'36': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa reported to Sugrīva, the lord of Vānaras. Hearing the words spoken by
  Lakṣmaṇa, that lord of Vānaras,
'37': >-
  became exceedingly downcast, like the Sun seized by Rāhu. Then, when thou wast
  being borne away by the Rākṣasa, the ornaments that adorned thy limbs,
'38': >-
  the many clusters of jewels that had fallen upon the earth—those all the
  leaders of the Vānaras brought and carried to Rāma.
'39': >-
  Rejoicing, they showed them (to him), yet they knew not thy course. Those were
  given to Rāma, and I myself brought them and placed them before him.
'40': >-
  Though they still jingled and lay scattered, when his mind was struck down, he
  placed them upon his lap, to look upon them, and then in many ways (he
  examined them) at that time.
'41': >-
  By that godlike radiance—by that divine man—lamentation was made, while he
  looked on them, wept over them, and fainted again and again;
'42': >-
  and thereby the fire of grief in Dāśarathi was kindled like a blazing
  oblation-fed flame.
'43': >-
  And for long was that great-souled one laid low by anguish; even I, with
  manifold words, with difficulty raised him up again.
'44': >-
  Having seen those most precious ornaments, showing them again and again,
  Rāghava, together with Saumitri, then committed (the task) to Sugrīva.
'45': >-
  Because of thy absence, O noble lady, Rāghava burns with torment—like a great
  blazing mountain of fire, ever aflame.
'46': >-
  For thy sake, sleeplessness and grief and anxious thought torment the
  great-souled Rāghava, like fires tormenting a house on fire.
'47': >-
  By the sorrow of not beholding thee, Rāghava is shaken—like a great
  mountain-peak shaken by a mighty earthquake.
'48': >-
  Wandering through most delightful forests, and along rivers and waterfalls, he
  finds no delight, O princess, when he does not behold thee.
'49': >-
  That tiger among men, Rāghava, will soon reach thee, O daughter of Janaka,
  having slain Rāvaṇa, along with his friends and kinsmen.
'50': >-
  Then Rāma and Sugrīva, both together, made a compact: to slay Vālin, and to
  undertake the search for thee.
'51': >-
  Thereafter, with those two heroic princes, that lord of Vānaras went to
  Kiṣkindhā, and Vālin was struck down in battle.
'52': >-
  Then, swiftly slaying Vālin in the fight, Rāma established Sugrīva as lord
  over all the hosts of bears and monkeys.
'53': >-
  Thus, O goddess, the unity of Rāma and Sugrīva came to be; and know me,
  Hanumān, to be the messenger who has come from them.
'54': >-
  Having regained his own kingdom, Sugrīva, bringing together the great monkeys
  who were his own, sent forth mighty ones in ten directions for thy sake.
'55': >-
  Commanded by Sugrīva, the mighty lord of Vānaras, heroic monkeys—resembling
  kings of mountains—set out in every direction across the earth.
'56': >-
  Then, searching—urged by Sugrīva’s command—they roam the entire world: we, and
  other Vānaras as well.
'57': >-
  Aṅgada by name, fortunate and most mighty, the son of Vālin—tiger among
  monkeys—set forth, surrounded by a force divided into three parts.
'58': >-
  For us, who could not find (thee), on the supreme Vindhya mountain, sorely
  afflicted by grief, many days and nights passed.
'59': >-
  Then we, through despair in the task, through the overpassing of the appointed
  time, and through fear of the king of monkeys, came to the point of giving up
  our lives.
'60': >-
  Having searched mountain-fastnesses and rivers and waterfalls, and not finding
  any trace of the goddess, we resolved to abandon our lives.
'61': >-
  Then, upon the summit of that mountain, we undertook the fast unto death; and
  seeing all the foremost Vānara chiefs seated in that resolve,
'62': >-
  Aṅgada, plunged deep in an ocean of grief, lamented exceedingly—both thy loss,
  O Vaidehī, and also the slaying of Vālin.
'63': >-
  And he lamented our undertaking of death by fasting, and the death of Jaṭāyus;
  and as for us, hopeless and desiring to die, for want of tidings from our
  lord—
'64': >-
  a mighty bird came there for the sake of the work: Sampāti by name, king of
  vultures, the brother of the lord of vultures (Jaṭāyus), great in valour.
'65': >-
  Hearing of his brother’s slaying, he said these words in wrath: ‘By whom was
  my younger brother slain, and where was he cast down?’”},{
'66': >-
  ‘This I desire to hear from you, O foremost of Vānaras.’ Then Aṅgada told him
  of the great slaughter in Janasthāna,
'67': >-
  how, by a Rākṣasa of terrible form, with thee as the true object. And hearing
  of Jaṭāyus’s slaying, that son of Aruṇa (Sampāti) was sorrowful.
'68': >-
  He spoke of thee, O fair-hipped one, as dwelling in Rāvaṇa’s abode. Hearing
  that word of Sampāti, which increased their joy,
'69': >-
  we all, with Aṅgada at our head, were then dispatched. Rising from the
  Vindhya, we reached the excellent far shore of the ocean.
'70': >-
  The monkeys, eager and resolute to behold thee, glad and strengthened,
  all—Aṅgada at their head—came to the edge of the sea.
'71': >-
  Yet again they fell into dreadful anxiety, longing for thy sight. Then I,
  seeing the ocean as the army of monkeys despaired,
'72': >-
  cast away fierce fear and leaped a hundred yojanas; and in the night I also
  entered Laṅkā, filled with Rākṣasas.
'73': >-
  I saw Rāvaṇa, and I saw thee—afflicted by grief. All this have I told thee, O
  blameless one, exactly as it occurred.
'74': >-
  Speak to me, O goddess: I am Dāśarathi’s messenger. For that reason have I
  come here—engaged in Rāma’s endeavour—because of thee.
'75': >-
  Know me, O goddess, to be Sugrīva’s counsellor, the son of the Wind-god. Thy
  Kakutstha is well, the foremost among all bearers of weapons.
'76': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa of auspicious marks is devoted to the service of the guru (his elder
  brother). That valiant one, O goddess, is intent on the welfare of thy lord.
'77': >-
  I alone have arrived here, by Sugrīva’s command. By me—without help—while
  roaming in whatever form I willed,
'78': >-
  the southern quarter was traversed in search of the knowledge of thy
  whereabouts. By good fortune, I (now) shall remove the anguish of the
  monkey-armies who grieve over thy loss.
'79': >-
  By the command of discovering thee, I shall take away thy burning sorrow.
  Truly, by good fortune, my leaping across the ocean has not been in vain.
'80': >-
  I shall attain, O goddess, the renown born of beholding thee; and Rāghava, of
  mighty valour, will swiftly come to thee,
'81': >-
  having slain Rāvaṇa, the lord of Rākṣasas, together with his sons and kinsmen.
  ‘Mālyavān’ by name, O Vaidehī, is the best of mountains;
'82': >-
  then goes the monkey Keśarī to the mountain called Gokarṇa; and he, my father,
  the great monkey, was appointed by divine seers—raising up the hermitage of
  Śambasādana at the holy ford of the lord of rivers (the ocean).
'83': >-
  In whose region, O Maithilī, I was born by the Wind; and I am famed in the
  world as ‘Hanumān’ by my own deeds alone.
'84': >-
  For the sake of thy trust, O Vaidehī, have I spoken of thy lord’s virtues.
  Soon, O goddess, Rāghava shall surely lead thee away from here.
'85': >-
  Thus Sītā, worn by grief, being convinced by reasons and by fitting tokens of
  recognition, acknowledged that messenger.
'86': >-
  And Janakī attained immeasurable joy; in her gladness, from her eyes with
  curved lashes, she let fall tears born of bliss.
'87': >-
  Then her lovely face, and her eyes reddened and whitened (with emotion), shone
  forth—on that large-eyed lady—like the moon freed from Rāhu.
'88': >-
  She understood Hanumān clearly to be a monkey, and not otherwise. Then Hanumān
  spoke to that fair and beloved-seeming lady in reply:
'89': >-
  “All this have I told thee; be comforted, O Maithilī. What shall I do? Or how
  does it please thee that I should return?”
'90': >-
  “After the Asura was slain in battle at Śambasādana by a foremost of monkeys,
  at the bidding of a great Ṛṣi, then was I born of the Wind, O
  Maithilī—powerful, and a Vānara comparable to him in might.”
'91': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fifth canto, named “The Arousing of Trust,” in the
  Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
