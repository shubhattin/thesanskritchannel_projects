  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninety-ninth chapter named “The Meeting with Rāma.”
'1': >-
  When the army had taken its position and settled, Bharata, filled with eager
  longing, went to behold his brother, with Śatrughna following close behind.
'2': >-
  Having instructed the sage Vasiṣṭha, “Quickly bring my mother,” he hurried on
  in front—Bharata, ever devoted to his preceptor.
'3': >-
  Sumantra too followed Śatrughna from not far behind; for in him also there
  arose the same thirst born of longing to behold Rāma, just as it had arisen in
  Bharata.
'4': >-
  As he went onward, the illustrious Bharata beheld his brother’s leaf-thatched
  hut and the hermitage-cottage standing near the ascetics’ dwelling-place.
'5': >-
  Then, before that hut, Bharata saw pieces of wood that had been broken and
  also flowers that had been gathered and heaped together.
'6': >-
  He saw, in the hermitage to which Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa had come, marks made upon
  the trees here and there with bundles of kuśa-grass and strips of bark-cloth,
  serving as signs.
'7': >-
  He also saw, within that forest, great heaps that had been made of the dung of
  deer and buffaloes, as a protection against the cold.
'8': >-
  While proceeding thus, the radiant, mighty-armed Bharata spoke with delight to
  Śatrughna and to all those ministers, one and all:
'9': >-
  “I think we have reached that region of which Bharadvāja spoke; for I believe
  the river Mandākinī is not far from here.”
'10': >-
  “These bark-garments have been tied up high—this must be Lakṣmaṇa’s
  work—making a path of recognition for one who wishes to go at an unseasonable
  hour (in the darkness or at a wrong time).”
'11': >-
  “And this is the track of mighty elephants, their extremities uplifted (their
  heads held high), strong and impetuous—moving along the mountain-slope,
  circling about and roaring at one another.”
'12': >-
  “There is that smoke, dense, with a dark trail, from the fire which the
  ascetics continually wish to maintain in the forest.”
'13': >-
  “Here, rejoicing, I shall behold Rāghava—the noble tiger among men—one who
  performs the rites due to the guru, like unto a great ṛṣi.”
'14': >-
  Then, having gone for a short while onward, he reached Citrakūṭa and came upon
  the Mandākinī; and he spoke these words to that company (that accompanied
  him):
'15': >-
  “On the earth sits the tiger among men, delighting in the hero’s seat; a lord
  among men, having reached a lonely place. Fie upon my birth and my continued
  life!”
'16': >-
  “For my sake the Lord of the world, of great splendour, has fallen into
  calamity; abandoning all enjoyments, Rāghava dwells in the forest.”
'17': >-
  “Thus reproached by the world, I shall today seek pardon, falling at the feet
  of Rāma, of Sītā, and of Lakṣmaṇa.”
'18': >-
  While thus lamenting in that forest, the son of Daśaratha beheld a great,
  holy, charming leaf-hut.
'19': >-
  Covered over with many leaves of sāla, tāla, and aśvakarṇa trees, broad and
  spacious, and softly strewn with kuśa-grass like an altar in a sacrifice.
'20': >-
  Adorned with bows resembling Indra’s thunderbolt—implements fit for bearing a
  weight—having golden backs, exceedingly strong, and destroyers of foes.
'21': >-
  Adorned with terrible arrows, gathered in quivers, gleaming like the rays of
  the sun—like a Bhogavatī (the serpent-world) made splendid by shining-faced
  serpents with expanded hoods.
'22': >-
  Made radiant by swords sheathed in silvery-white coverings, and also made
  beautiful by leather-shields variegated with golden dots.
'23': >-
  With striking ornaments fastened with iguana-tails and embellished with gold;
  unassailable by bands of enemies—like a lion’s cave filled with wild beasts.
'24': >-
  There, in that holy abode of Rāma, Bharata beheld a broad altar, sloping
  toward the east and toward the north, with a blazing sacred fire.
'25': >-
  Gazing there for a moment, Bharata saw his elder brother seated in the hut,
  wearing a circle of matted locks.
'26': >-
  He saw Rāma seated there, clad in a black antelope-skin, wearing garments of
  bark and fibre, with a radiance all around him like that of fire.
'27': >-
  Lion-shouldered, mighty-armed, lotus-eyed—righteous in conduct—the lord of the
  entire earth bounded by the ocean.
'28': >-
  Seated—mighty-armed—like Brahmā the Eternal, upon bare ground strewn with
  darbha-grass, together with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa.
'29': >-
  Seeing him, the illustrious Bharata, overwhelmed by sorrow and grief, the
  righteous-souled son of Kaikeyī, ran toward him.
'30': >-
  At that very sight he lamented in anguish, his words choked and blurred by
  tears; unable to hold to firmness, he spoke:
'31': >-
  “He whom the citizens and natural subjects would attend upon in the royal
  court as one fit to be served—he, my elder brother, now sits attended by
  forest-dwelling deer!”
'32': >-
  “He, the great-souled one, to whom thousands of garments were fitting in the
  palace—he lies here upon a deer-skin, practising righteousness.”
'33': >-
  “He who once wore many kinds of lovely and variegated garlands of flowers—how
  is it that this Rāghava now bears this heavy burden of matted locks?”
'34': >-
  “He who, by sacrifices performed according to injunction, amassed the wealth
  of dharma—he now seeks that very dharma born of bodily hardship!”
'35': >-
  “He whose limbs were served with most precious sandal-paste—how is it that
  this noble one’s body is now being served by grime and dirt?”
'36': >-
  “Because of me, Rāma—accustomed to happiness—has come to this sorrow. Fie upon
  the life of me, a cruel man, censured by the world!”
'37': >-
  Thus lamenting, wretched, his lotus-face covered in sweat, Bharata—without
  even reaching Rāma’s feet—fell down, weeping.
'38': >-
  Bharata, the mighty prince, tormented by grief, having once uttered piteously
  the word “Ārya!”, spoke nothing again.
'39': >-
  His throat blocked with tears, looking upon the illustrious Rāma, he cried out
  only “Ārya!”—and then was unable to speak further.
'40': >-
  Śatrughna too, weeping, bowed down to Rāma’s feet. Embracing them both, Rāma
  also let his tears flow.
'41': >-
  Then, in that great forest, the royal sons came together—along with Sumantra
  and Guha—like the Sun and the Moon in the sky together with Śukra and
  Bṛhaspati.
'42': >-
  Seeing those kings—like lordly elephants leading their herds—assembled there
  in the vast forest, even the forest-dwellers, all of them, shed tears, casting
  aside their joy.
'43': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-ninth chapter, named “The Meeting with Rāma,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
