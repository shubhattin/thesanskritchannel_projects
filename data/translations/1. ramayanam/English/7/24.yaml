'0': >-
  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa,
  begins the twenty-fourth canto, called “The Command assigning Khara and
  Śūrpaṇakhā a residence in the Daṇḍaka forest.”
'1': >-
  As he was returning, the exceedingly wicked Rāvaṇa, exultant at heart, seized
  on the way the daughters of kings, of ṛṣis, of devas, and of gandharvas.
'2': >-
  Whenever that rākṣasa beheld a maiden or a woman of comely beauty, he would
  slay her kinsmen and then confine her within his aerial car.
'3': >-
  Thus did he make the serpent-maidens, and women of the rākṣasas, asuras, and
  men, as well as the daughters of yakṣas and dānavas, mount into his aerial
  chariot.
'4': >-
  And all of them together, in their misery, let fall a flood of tears—born of
  sorrow—like unto the equal, blazing tongues of fire there, arising from the
  fire of grief and fear.
'5': >-
  That aerial car, filled with those blameless women, became like the ocean
  filled by rivers—overflowing with their tears, born of fear, sorrow, and
  anguish.
'6': >-
  Nāga-maidens and gandharva-maidens, and the daughters of great ṛṣis, and the
  daughters of daityas and dānavas—all by the hundreds wept within the aerial
  car.
'7': >-
  Long-haired, fair-limbed, with faces like the full moon; full-breasted, and
  shining in the middle like a diamond altar—such were they.
'8': >-
  With hips resembling the pole of a chariot, enchanting to behold—women like
  celestial nymphs, radiant like molten gold.
'9': >-
  Affrighted by grief, sorrow, and fear, and utterly bewildered, those
  slender-waisted women—by the wind of their sighs—seemed to set everything
  blazing on every side.
'10': >-
  The Puṣpaka, as though its fire were shut in, shone like a sacrificial
  Agnihotra; and those women, having fallen under the power of Daśagrīva, were
  overwhelmed with grief.
'11': >-
  With miserable, downcast eyes, dark-hued, like doe-deer brought under a lion’s
  dominion, one of them there thought, “What if he should devour me?”
'12': >-
  Another, afflicted with exceeding sorrow, pondered, “He may even slay me.”
  Remembering her mother and father, her husband, and likewise her brothers, all
  those women, seized by misery and grief, lamented together.
'13': >-
  “How indeed will my son live without me? How my mother, how my brother—sunk in
  an ocean of sorrow?”
'14': >-
  “Alas! How shall I live without that husband of mine? O Death, I beseech
  thee—take me, a sharer of suffering.”
'15': >-
  “What is that evil deed, committed of old, in some former body, (whose fruit I
  now endure)?”
'16': >-
  Thus, all of them, sorrowing, fallen into the ocean of grief, said: “Surely
  now we do not see any end to this sorrow of ours.”
'17': >-
  “Ah! Fie on the world of men! There is none more base indeed—since we, the
  helpless, have been taken by the powerful Rāvaṇa as our lords.”
'18': >-
  “As stars are destroyed when the sun rises at its time, so have we been
  brought to ruin. Ah, this rākṣasa is exceedingly strong and applies himself to
  means of slaughter.”
'19': >-
  “Ah, having adopted evil conduct, he feels no shame at himself at all. In
  truth, the valor of this wicked-souled one is, in every way, just like that.”
'20': >-
  “This deed is unworthy—laying hands upon another’s wife. For this vilest of
  rākṣasas takes delight in women belonging to others.”
'21': >-
  “Therefore, through a woman alone this evil-minded one shall obtain his
  death.” Thus was this uttered by those chaste and noble women.
'22': >-
  Then drums in the sky resounded, and a rain of flowers fell down. Cursed by
  women, he became as though his splendor were slain—bereft of radiance.
'23': >-
  By those faithful, virtuous, chaste women he became, as it were, downcast.
  Hearing their lamentation, the foremost of rākṣasas entered the city of Laṅkā,
  being honored by the night-rangers.
'24': >-
  In the meanwhile, a dreadful rākṣasī, able to assume forms at will—his own
  sister—suddenly fell upon the ground.
'25': >-
  Rāvaṇa raised up his sister and, consoling her, said: “What is this, gentle
  one? Speak to me quickly—what wouldst thou say?”
'26': >-
  She, her eyes obstructed with tears, her eyes reddened, spoke these words: “O
  king, by thee—strong and using force—I have been made a widow.”
'27': >-
  “These heroes have been slain by thee in battle, O king—daityas famed as
  Kālakeyas—fourteen thousand.”
'28': “There, my husband, of great might, was dearer to me even than life-breath.”
'29': >-
  “He too has been slain by thee, dear brother—by an enemy greedy of his
  brother’s possessions. O king, I have been struck down by thee—indeed by my
  own kinsman.”
'30': >-
  “O king, because of thee I must bear the very name of widowhood. Surely,
  indeed, even in battles my son-in-law ought to have been protected by thee;
  yet thou hast thyself slain him in war—art thou not ashamed?”
'31': >-
  Thus addressed by his sister crying aloud, Daśagrīva spoke to her after
  comforting her, with conciliatory words, saying this:
'32': >-
  “Enough, dear child, with thy weeping; and thou shouldst not fear in any way.
  With gifts, with honor, and with favors I shall strive to please thee.”
'33': >-
  “In the frenzy of battle, distracted, desiring victory, hurling arrows, I do
  not recognize in wars, O auspicious one, who are my own and who are foes.”
'34': >-
  “I did not know him to be thy son-in-law, while striking in battle-madness;
  therefore was he slain by me in the conflict—thy husband, O sister.”
'35': >-
  “But now, whatever has come to pass at this time, I shall do what is
  beneficial for thee. Dwell beside Khara, who is endowed with a brother’s
  sovereignty.”
'36': >-
  “He shall be to thee as a brother in place of those fourteen thousand; mighty
  in strength, a lord among rākṣasas—able in marching forth and in granting
  gifts.”
'37': >-
  “There, this Khara—thy maternal cousin—this brother, a powerful lord, shall
  ever act according to thy command, O night-ranger.”
'38': >-
  “Let that hero go swiftly to guard the Daṇḍakas; and Dūṣaṇa, of great might,
  shall become the commander of his forces.”
'39': >-
  “There the valiant Khara shall always do thy bidding; he shall become the lord
  of the shape-changing rākṣasas.”
'40': >-
  Thus having spoken, Daśagrīva commanded his army—fourteen thousand rākṣasas,
  possessed of valor.
'41': >-
  Surrounded by all those rākṣasas of terrible appearance, Khara came quickly to
  the Daṇḍaka forest, fearless from any quarter.
'42': >-
  There he established a rule in which all thorns were cut down; and Śūrpaṇakhā
  too dwelt there in the forest of Daṇḍaka.
'43': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fourth canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Command assigning Khara and Śūrpaṇakhā a
  residence in the Daṇḍaka forest.”
