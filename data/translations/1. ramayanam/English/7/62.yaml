  Now, in the holy, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins
  the sixty-second chapter, named “Śatrughna’s Supplication (Prayer).”
'1': >-
  When the sages had spoken thus, Rāma, with palms joined in reverence,
  addressed those ṛṣis again: “What is Lavaṇa’s food, what is his conduct, and
  where does he dwell?”
'2': >-
  Hearing the words of Rāghava, all those sages then made known to him how
  Lavaṇa had grown and become what he was.
'3': >-
  “His food is all living beings—ascetics especially; his conduct is ever fierce
  and cruel; and his dwelling is likewise in the Madhu-forest.
'4': >-
  “Having slain many thousands of lions, tigers, deer, and elephants, he also
  makes men his constant food as his daily fare.
'5': >-
  “Then that mighty one devours the very entrails of creatures; when destruction
  draws near, he appears like Death himself with gaping mouth.
'6': >-
  Hearing those words, Rāghava spoke to the great sages: “I shall cause that
  rākṣasa to be slain; let your fear depart.”
'7': >-
  Having thus pledged his word to those austere sages of dreadful splendour,
  that delight of the Raghus then spoke to all his brothers together:
'8': >-
  “Which hero shall be the slayer of Lavaṇa? Whose portion (charge) shall this
  be appointed—mighty-armed Bharata’s, or wise Śatrughna’s?”
'9': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāghava, Bharata said: “I shall kill him; let that task be
  assigned as my portion.”
'10': >-
  Hearing Bharata’s words, endowed with steadfastness and valour, Lakṣmaṇa’s
  younger brother rose up, leaving his golden seat.
'11': >-
  Śatrughna spoke, bowing low before the lord of men—great-armed, one who had
  accomplished his tasks, the middle (younger) son, that delight of the Raghus:
'12': >-
  “Formerly, by your noble self Ayodhyā was safeguarded though left desolate,
  with anguish kept within the heart, awaiting the noble one’s return.
'13': >-
  “And many sorrows were endured here, O king; lying upon beds of misery, he
  dwelt long ago at Nandigrāma.
'14': >-
  “Living on fruits and roots, with matted locks, wearing bark-garments—such
  suffering did this son of Rāghava endure. While I am present as your servant,
  O king, he should not again incur hardship.”
'15': >-
  As Śatrughna spoke thus, Rāghava replied once more: “So be it, O Kākutstha;
  let my command be carried out.
'16': >-
  “I shall consecrate you to sovereignty in Madhu’s auspicious city. Establish
  Bharata (there), O mighty-armed one, if you approve.”
'17': >-
  “You are brave, learned, and fully capable of founding and settling (a
  realm).”
'18': >-
  “For he who, after uprooting an enemy, and when the king has perished, does
  not establish a ruler there—he indeed goes to hell.”
'19': >-
  “Therefore you—having slain Lavaṇa, the son of Madhu, of sinful resolve—govern
  the kingdom in righteousness, if you heed my word.”
'20': >-
  “And no reply is to be spoken, O hero, in the midst of my words. A younger
  brother must carry out the elder’s command—of this there is no doubt.”
'21': >-
  “And accept, O Kākutstha, the consecration prepared by me, with Vasiṣṭha and
  the foremost brāhmaṇas presiding, together with the proper rites and sacred
  mantras.”
'22': >-
  Thus ends, in the ṛṣi’s (Vālmīki’s) holy and illustrious Rāmāyaṇa, the First
  Epic, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the sixty-second chapter, named “Śatrughna’s
  Supplication (Prayer).”
