  Now begins the sixty-third canto in the Aranya-kanda of the holy
  Valmiki-Ramayana, entitled “Brooding upon Sorrow”.
'1': >-
  That prince, bereft of his beloved, tormented by grief and overwhelmed by
  delusion, making his brother despondent, appearing himself in piteous plight,
  again entered into a fierce and deeper despair.
'2': >-
  Rama—sunk in vast grief—addressed Lakshmana, who had been overcome by sorrow,
  and, heaving hot sighs and weeping in anguish, spoke words befitting the
  calamity.
'3': >-
  “I deem that on this earth there is no second man like me, a doer of evil
  deeds. For grief upon grief, in unbroken succession, comes to me, rending my
  heart and my mind.”
'4': >-
  “Surely in the past I must have again and again committed sins—deeds long
  desired (by my own misguided will). Now that fruit has fallen upon me today:
  that I enter into sorrow upon sorrow.”
'5': >-
  “The loss of the kingdom, separation from my own kinsmen, the death of my
  father, the sundering from my mother—when I reflect upon them, all of them, O
  Lakshmana, fill up and overflow my surge of grief.”
'6': >-
  “All this sorrow of mine, O Lakshmana, had grown quiet when I came to the
  forest and endured hardship in the body; yet, from separation from Sita, it
  has flared up again—like fire that, strewn with dry fuel, suddenly blazes
  forth.”
'7': >-
  “Surely my noble lady, timid by nature, has been carried off by a
  rakshasa—borne up into the sky. With her sweet voice broken into wailing, she
  must have cried out repeatedly, shrieking in fear.”
'8': >-
  “Those rounded breasts—so dear to behold, ever fit for the finest
  sandal-paste, of a hue like fresh red—now, smeared with clots of blood and
  mire, must have been struck and wounded: alas, my beloved’s!”
'9': >-
  “Her face—soft in speech, smooth, clearly defined, gentle in utterance, with
  its burden of curling hair—now that she has come under the power of a
  rakshasa, surely does not shine, like the moon when seized by Rahu’s mouth.”
'10': >-
  “That neck of my beloved, faithful in vows, ever worthy of a string of
  pearls—surely the blood-eating rakshasas have drunk it, piercing it in a
  lonely place.”
'11': >-
  “Separated from me, alone in the desolate forest, seized by rakshasas and
  dragged away—surely she, wretched, with large and lovely eyes, must have
  uttered a cry, like a female kurari-bird set free in lament.”
'12': >-
  “Upon this very rock-surface, formerly, of noble conduct, she sat with me;
  with charming smile, O Lakshmana, Sita—breaking into laughter—spoke to you
  many a word.”
'13': >-
  “This Godavari—the foremost among rivers—was ever dear to my beloved. I keep
  thinking, ‘Would she have gone here?’ Yet she never goes anywhere at all
  alone.”
'14': >-
  “Lotus-faced, lotus-petal-eyed, she may have set out to gather lotuses; but
  even that is unfitting—for she does not, at any time, go to pluck
  lotus-flowers without me.”
'15': >-
  “Granted, this grove of flowering trees, filled with flocks of birds of many
  kinds—might she have gone into the forest? Even that is improper: timid as she
  is, she is exceedingly afraid to be alone.”
'16': >-
  “O Sun—knower of what is done and left undone in the world, witness to the
  true and the untrue deeds of beings—tell me fully, for I am smitten by grief:
  where has my beloved gone, or has she been carried away?”
'17': >-
  “In all the worlds there is nothing that is not ever known to you. Tell me, O
  Wind, where that guardian of my lineage is—whether she is dead, or abducted,
  or whether she is on the path (somewhere).”
'18': >-
  Thus, as Rama—his body wholly governed by grief—lay senseless, wailing still,
  Saumitri (Lakshmana), undaunted in spirit, standing upon what was right, spoke
  words that were timely and proper.
'19': >-
  “Cast away grief today; take refuge in firmness. Let there be zeal in the
  search for her. For men who are full of energy do not, in this world, sink
  down in deeds that are exceedingly difficult.”
'20': >-
  Though Lakshmana of mighty valor spoke thus, the afflicted Rama, increaser of
  the glory of Raghu’s line, did not take up courage; having let go of
  fortitude, he again fell into great sorrow.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-third canto in the Aranya-kanda of the revered
  Valmiki-Ramayana, the Adi-kavya, entitled “Brooding upon Sorrow”.
