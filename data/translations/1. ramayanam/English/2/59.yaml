  Now begins the fifty-ninth sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Daśaratha’s Lamentation.”
'1': >-
  But when I had turned back, my horses did not set forth again upon the road,
  shedding hot tears, for Rāma had departed for the forest.
'2': >-
  Then, having made obeisance with folded hands to both the royal princes, I set
  out, mounting the chariot, bearing even that sorrow as best I could.
'3': >-
  There I remained for many days, like Guha, sustained by the hope that Rāma
  might call for me again.
'4': >-
  In your realm, O great king, even the trees—worn down by my calamity—have
  withered, though they were filled with blossoms, shoots, and tender buds.
'5': >-
  The rivers have their waters heated; the marshes and lakes as well; the
  forests and groves have leaves as though scorched all around.
'6': >-
  Creatures do not creep about, nor do beasts of prey range forth; that forest,
  overwhelmed by grief for Rāma, became silent and without any cry.
'7': >-
  The lotus-leaves have sunk down; the waters, O lord of men, have grown foul;
  the lotus-pools have their lotuses scorched; fish and birds have hidden
  themselves away.
'8': >-
  Neither the water-born flowers nor the garlands and land-born blossoms shine
  today; even the fruits are of little fragrance—not as they once were.
'9': >-
  Here the gardens stand empty, and the birds have vanished within them; nor do
  I see the delightful pleasure-groves, O bull among men.
'10': >-
  As I enter Ayodhyā, none welcomes me; the people, not beholding Rāma, heave
  sighs again and again.
'11': >-
  Seeing the chariot of the king of the gods returning here without Rāma, all
  the people on the royal highway—faces wet with tears from sorrow—were
  overcome.
'12': >-
  From mansions, lofty aerial terraces, and palaces, seeing the chariot arrive,
  the women—distressed by not seeing Rāma—raised cries of “Alas! Alas!”
'13': >-
  With long, clear eyes flooded by the rush of tears, the women looked upon one
  another, plainly more and more afflicted.
'14': >-
  Whether among enemies, or friends, or those who are indifferent, in my anguish
  I perceive no distinction at all in anyone.
'15': >-
  The people are without delight; the elephants and horses are dejected; their
  voices are feeble and distressed, and they are filled with sighs and the sound
  of heavy breathing.
'16': >-
  Joyless, O great king, shaken by Rāma’s banishment, Ayodhyā appears to me as
  though she were Kauśalyā herself, bereft of her son.
'17': >-
  Hearing the charioteer’s words, the king—his voice utterly forlorn, choked by
  tears—spoke to that charioteer thus:
'18': >-
  Urged on by Kaikeyī—of sinful disposition and ignoble nature—I did not take
  counsel and support with aged men skilled in counsel.
'19': >-
  Neither with well-wishers, nor with ministers, nor after consulting the
  guildsmen and townsmen—out of delusion, because of a woman, I did this matter
  rashly.
'20': >-
  Surely, by the force of destiny, this great calamity has come—by mere chance,
  O charioteer—for the destruction of this very lineage.
'21': >-
  O charioteer, if there is any merit at all that has been done by me—any good
  deed—then bring Rāma to me quickly; my very life-breaths hurry me onward.
'22': >-
  Let whatever command of mine there is cause Rāghava to return; without Rāma I
  shall not be able to live even for a single moment.
'23': >-
  Or perhaps the mighty-armed one has gone far away; place me myself upon the
  chariot and swiftly show me to Rāma.
'24': >-
  Where is that elder brother of Lakṣmaṇa—he of disciplined conduct, with firm
  tusks, the great archer? If I yet live, may I but see him, together with Sītā.
'25': >-
  If I do not see Rāma—red-eyed, mighty-armed, adorned with jeweled earrings—I
  shall go to the abode of Yama.
'26': >-
  What, indeed, could be more sorrowful than this—that I, an enhancer of the
  Ikṣvāku line, have fallen into such a state and do not see Rāghava here?
'27': >-
  Ha Rāma! Rāma! Ha, younger brother! Alas, Vaidehī, the ascetic woman! Do you
  not know me, dying of grief, like one without any refuge?
'28': >-
  Thus the king, his mind utterly overwhelmed by that sorrow, plunged into a
  most difficult-to-cross ocean of grief.
'29': >-
  Its vast expanse was grief for Rāma; its far shore was separation from Sītā;
  its mighty whirlpools were his heaving breaths; its waters were turbid with
  the foam of tears.
'30': >-
  A shoal of fish was the flinging of his arms; its great roar was his
  lamentation; its seaweed was his disheveled hair; its mare-faced monster was
  Kaikeyī.
'31': >-
  Born from the torrent of my tears is its flood; the great crocodile is the
  speech of Mantharā; its shore is the boon—cruelly set—bringing about Rāma’s
  banishment.
'32': >-
  In which, alas, I am sunk—without Rāghava, O Kauśalyā—this ocean of grief is,
  for me who yet lives, impossible to cross, O queen.
'33': >-
  “How inauspicious it is that I, here today, desiring to behold Rāghava, do not
  obtain him together with Lakṣmaṇa!”—lamenting thus, the illustrious king fell
  quickly upon his bed, fainted.
'34': >-
  When the lord of the earth thus lamented and lay as though lost, the
  queen—hearing his words, even more piteous and doubled in compassion on
  account of Rāma—was seized once again by fear, Rāma’s mother.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-ninth sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the ancient, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the Ādikavi, entitled “Daśaratha’s Lamentation.”
