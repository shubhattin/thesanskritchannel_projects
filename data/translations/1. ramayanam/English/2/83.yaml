  Now begins the eighty-third chapter in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Bharata’s Departure for the Forest.”
'1': >-
  Then Bharata, rising early in the morning, mounted an excellent chariot and
  set forth swiftly, longing for the sight of Rāma.
'2': >-
  In front of him went all his counsellors and the family priests, having
  mounted chariots yoked with horses, resembling the chariot of the Sun.
'3': >-
  Nine thousand elephants, duly prepared according to prescribed rule, followed
  Bharata as he journeyed—Bharata, the delight of the Ikṣvāku line.
'4': >-
  Six thousand chariots, bearing archers furnished with weapons of many kinds,
  followed Bharata as he journeyed—the illustrious prince, the son of a king.
'5': >-
  A hundred thousand horsemen, mounted upon horses, followed Bharata as he
  journeyed—the illustrious prince, the son of a king.
'6': >-
  And Kaikeyī, and Sumitrā, and the renowned Kauśalyā—delighted at the thought
  of bringing Rāma back—went in a radiant conveyance.
'7': >-
  And gatherings of noble ladies set out to behold Rāma together with Lakṣmaṇa,
  their minds uplifted with joy, speaking among themselves many wonderful tales
  concerning him.
'8': >-
  “When shall we behold Rāma—dark as a rain-cloud, mighty-armed, steadfast in
  courage, firm in vow—he who removes the sorrow of the world?”
'9': >-
  “Indeed, merely by being seen, Rāghava will take away our grief—like the
  rising sun dispelling the darkness of all the world.”
'10': >-
  Thus speaking, filled with gladness, and exchanging auspicious words, the
  citizens then went on, embracing one another.
'11': >-
  And all the other townsmen there as well—those esteemed among the
  guilds—indeed all the subjects then went forth, delighted, toward Rāma.
'12': >-
  Jewel-workers too, and handsome potters; and those engaged in the work of
  weaving; and those who earned their livelihood by weapons,
'13': >-
  makers of peacock-ornaments, sawyers, dyers, piercers and engravers as well;
  ivory-workers, plasterers, and those who lived by perfumes,
'14': >-
  famed goldsmiths; and washers of woollen blankets; bath-attendants,
  cloth-warders, physicians; incense-makers, and vintners as well,
'15': >-
  washermen, tailors, and weavers; village and market headmen; actors with their
  womenfolk; and fishermen too—all went along.
'16': >-
  Brāhmaṇas, self-controlled and versed in the Vedas, approved for their
  righteous conduct, followed Bharata as he journeyed—by thousands—in carts
  drawn by oxen.
'17': >-
  Well-adorned, clad in spotless garments, anointed with polished copper-hued
  unguents, all of them, in various conveyances, followed Bharata at a measured
  pace.
'18': >-
  That army, glad and exultant, accompanied Kaikeyī’s son Bharata—the lover of
  his brother—who was going to bring back his brother.
'19': >-
  Having gone a long distance, with chariots, vehicles, horses, and elephants,
  they then reached the Gaṅgā, on the way toward Śṛṅgibera-pura.
'20': >-
  There dwelt the heroic Guha, Rāma’s friend, surrounded by his kinsmen,
  guarding that region diligently and without negligence.
'21': >-
  Approaching the bank of the Gaṅgā, adorned with cakravāka birds, that
  army—following Bharata—halted there.
'22': >-
  Seeing the army that had followed him, and the auspicious waters of the Gaṅgā,
  Bharata, skilled in speech, addressed all his ministers:
'23': >-
  “Encamp my forces everywhere according to your judgment. Having rested, we
  shall cross this great river at daybreak.”
'24': >-
  “And before that, I desire to make an offering for the sake of the departed
  lord of the earth, for the rite connected with the obsequies. Descending to
  the river, I will offer water.”
'25': >-
  When he spoke thus, the ministers, saying, “So be it,” and being attentive,
  caused the army to encamp, each in his own proper place, separately and
  orderly.
'26': >-
  And having encamped that host along the Gaṅgā, that great river—splendidly
  furnished and arranged according to due formations—Bharata then abode there,
  pondering the return of great-souled Rāma.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-third chapter in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “Bharata’s Departure for the Forest.”
