  Now begins the eighty-eighth sarga of the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Meeting with Budha.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that account—closely connected in its sequence and duly narrated by
  Rāma—Lakṣmaṇa and Bharata were filled with the utmost amazement.
'2': >-
  Then those two, with joined palms, again questioned that great king Rāma,
  asking in detail about the true import and inner purport of that occurrence.
'3': >-
  “How did that king, fallen into misfortune, conduct himself after becoming a
  woman? And when he again became a man, what manner of life did he then lead?”
'4': >-
  Hearing their words, spoken with keen curiosity, the son of Kakutstha related,
  just as it had happened, the further account concerning that king.
'5': >-
  For the first month, having become a woman—a beauty enchanting to the
  worlds—she, surrounded by those women who had formerly been her male
  attendants and followers,
'6': >-
  swiftly entered that forest and sported there, that world-fair
  one—lotus-petalled-eyed—wandering on foot amid trees, shrubs, and creepers
  thickly grown.
'7': >-
  Casting aside all vehicles on every side, Ilā then delighted in that
  mountain-region, in a spacious cleft among the mountain slopes.
'8': >-
  Then, in that tract of forest, not far from the mountain, there was a lake
  renowned for exceeding loveliness, thronged with flocks of many kinds of
  birds.
'9': >-
  There Ilā beheld Budha, the son of Soma, blazing with his own effulgence like
  the full moon newly risen.
'10': >-
  She saw him practicing severe austerity, ardent in tapas, stationed in the
  midst of the waters, difficult of approach—one who bestows fame, who fulfils
  desires, and who was established in compassion.
'11': >-
  Astonished, she agitated and disturbed the entire lake, O delight of the Raghu
  line, along with those former men who had become women and were with her.
'12': >-
  But Budha, the moment he looked upon her, came under the sway of Love’s
  arrows; he no longer found mastery over himself, and he trembled there in the
  water.
'13': >-
  Gazing upon Ilā—auspicious and surpassing the three worlds—he was overcome by
  anxious thought: “Who indeed is this, superior even to the goddesses?”
'14': >-
  “Neither among celestial maidens, nor among nāga-women, nor among asura-women,
  nor among apsarases have I ever before seen anyone adorned with such beauty of
  form.”
'15': >-
  “She would be a fitting match for me, if only she were not already another’s
  possession.” Having thus settled his mind, he came out of the water to the
  bank.
'16': >-
  Approaching his hermitage, that righteous one called out to those foremost
  among women; and they also bowed down to him.
'17': >-
  That righteous one asked them: “Whose is this world-beauty? And for what
  purpose has she come? Declare everything to me without delay.”
'18': >-
  Hearing his auspicious words—sweet, and composed of gentle syllables—all those
  women replied in sweet speech:
'19': >-
  “This fair-hipped lady ever abides in sovereignty over us; without a husband,
  she roams within the depths of the forest along with us.”
'20': >-
  Hearing that speech of those women—unclear and lacking distinct import—the
  twice-born sage set in motion a holy, knowledge-bearing spell of unravelling.
'21': >-
  Having understood completely the true matter, just as it had occurred to that
  king, the foremost of sages then addressed all those women:
'22': >-
  “Having become kimpuruṣī-women, you will dwell here upon this mountain-slope.
  Let a habitation on this mountain be arranged at once.
'23': >-
  “By roots, leaves, and fruits you shall maintain yourselves at all times; and
  as kimpuruṣī-women you shall obtain husbands who are kimpuruṣa-men.”
'24': >-
  Hearing the words of Soma’s son, those who had been transformed into
  kimpuruṣī-women then took up residence upon the mountain, numerous as brides.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-eighth sarga of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the holy, illustrious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Meeting with Budha.”
