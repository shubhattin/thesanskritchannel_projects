  Now begins the thirtieth sarga, named “The Slaying of Khara,” in the
  Aranya-kanda of the glorious Valmiki Ramayana.
'1': >-
  But Raghava, devoted to righteousness, having shattered that mace with his
  arrows, spoke these words, smiling yet with controlled fury.
'2': >-
  “This—your entire pride of strength—has been shown, O vilest of rakshasas.
  Weaker than I, you roar in vain.”
'3': >-
  “This mace, split open by my arrows, has fallen upon the earth—striking down
  the confidence of you who are so boldly boastful in speech.”
'4': >-
  “And the words you spoke—‘I shall wipe away the tears of those who have been
  destroyed’—even that, O rakshasa, has proved false.”
'5': >-
  “I shall take away the life of this base rakshasa—petty in nature, of mean
  conduct, and false in behavior—just as Garutman once carried off the nectar of
  immortality.”
'6': >-
  “Today the earth shall drink your blood—your throat split, your mouth adorned
  with bubbles of froth—torn open by my arrows.”
'7': >-
  “Your whole body smeared with dust, your two arms slack and cast down, you
  shall sleep, embracing the ground as though it were a hard-to-attain beloved
  woman.”
'8': >-
  “When you, O filth of rakshasas, lie in deep sleep, these Dandaka forests
  shall become a refuge for those worthy of refuge.”
'9': >-
  “At Janasthana—now made your place of slaughter by my arrows—the sages shall
  roam everywhere in the forest, free from fear.”
'10': >-
  “Today the rakshasa women, their kinsmen slain, shall flee—wretched, their
  faces wet with tears—out of fear, becoming themselves a spectacle of fear.”
'11': >-
  “Today those women, acquainted with the taste of grief, shall become bereft of
  all purpose—those noble-born wives whose husband is such as you.”
'12': >-
  “O you of cruel disposition, petty-souled one, ever a thorn to
  brahmanas—because of you, the sages, in apprehension, cast their oblations
  into the fire.”
'13': >-
  While Raghava in the forest spoke thus, enraged, Khara—with a voice harsher
  from wrath—rebuked him in return.
'14': >-
  “Surely you are firmly arrogant—fearless even amid dangers. Therefore you do
  not discern what should or should not be spoken, being already under Death’s
  sway.”
'15': >-
  “For those men who are thrown into the noose of Time lose their senses and do
  not know what is to be done and what is not to be done.”
'16': >-
  Having said so, then, knitting his brows and confronting Rama, that
  night-ranger saw a great sala tree not far away.
'17': >-
  Looking all around for a weapon to use in battle, he tore it up, grinding his
  teeth and biting his lips.
'18': >-
  Lifting it with both arms, roaring aloud, the mighty one hurled it toward
  Rama, saying, “You are slain!”
'19': >-
  As it came rushing on, Rama, mighty in prowess, cut it down with a flood of
  arrows, and his fierce wrath rose to slay Khara in battle.
'20': >-
  Then Rama, bathed in sweat, his eyes red at the corners with anger, pierced
  Khara in combat with a thousand arrows.
'21': >-
  From within the gaps between those arrows, much blood streamed out,
  foaming—like the outflow of rivulets and cascading streams from a mountain
  spring.
'22': >-
  Wounded and unsteady from Rama’s arrows in the fight, Khara, intoxicated by
  the smell of blood, rushed swiftly at him once again.
'23': >-
  Seeing him charge—enraged, skilled in weapons, drenched in blood—Rama stepped
  back two or three paces, with movement only slightly quickened.
'24': >-
  Then Rama took up, in battle, a blazing, fire-like arrow meant for Khara’s
  killing—like another Brahma-staff for chastisement.
'25': >-
  That righteous-souled one fixed and released it against Khara—an arrow granted
  by the wise Maghavan, the lord of the gods.
'26': >-
  That great arrow, loosed—resounding like a thunderclap as Rama drew his bow to
  full stretch—struck upon Khara’s chest.
'27': >-
  Khara fell upon the earth, burning with the fire of that arrow—like Andhaka in
  the Shvetaranya, scorched down by Rudra.
'28': >-
  As Vritra fell by the thunderbolt, as Namuchi fell by the foam, as Bala fell
  when Indra struck with his lightning—so fell Khara, slain.
'29': >-
  Just then the gods, gathered together with the Charanas, beat celestial
  kettledrums and showered flowers on all sides.
'30': >-
  Amazed and filled with delight, they rained flowers upon Rama from
  above—within little more than half a muhūrta, by Rama’s sharp arrows,
'31': >-
  fourteen thousand shape-shifting rakshasas—headed by Khara and Dushana—had
  been slain in that mighty battle.
'32': >-
  “Ah, what a great deed of Rama, the knower of his own true nature! Ah, what
  heroism, what steadfast might—truly it appears like that of Vishnu!”
'33': >-
  Having spoken thus, all those gods departed as they had come. Then all the
  royal seers and supreme seers assembled together.
'34': >-
  Honoring Rama with joy, along with Agastya they said this: “For this very
  purpose, O great-lustered one, Mahendra—Indra, chastiser of Paka—
'35': >-
  came to the holy hermitage of Sharabhanga. By the great seers you were brought
  to this region through a deliberate means,
'36': >-
  for the sake of slaying these enemies—the rakshasas of sinful deeds. Thus, O
  son of Dasharatha, you have accomplished our task.”
'37': >-
  “Now the great seers shall practice their own dharma in the Dandaka forests.”
  Meanwhile, the hero Lakshmana, together with Sita,
'38': >-
  came out from the mountain stronghold and entered the hermitage joyfully; and
  then Rama, victorious, was worshiped by the great seers.
'39': >-
  The hero entered the hermitage, honored by Lakshmana. Seeing him—the slayer of
  foes, the bringer of well-being to the great seers—
'40': >-
  Vaidehi was overjoyed and embraced her husband. Filled with supreme delight on
  seeing the hosts of rakshasas slain, and seeing Rama himself unharmed, the
  daughter of Janaka was fully content.
'41': >-
  Then, as that crusher of the rakshasa host was being duly honored by the
  rejoicing great-souled sages, the daughter of Janaka, her face bright with
  joy, embraced him again and became glad at heart.
'42': >-
  Thus ends the thirtieth sarga, named “The Slaying of Khara,” in the
  Aranya-kanda of the holy, glorious Ramayana composed by Valmiki, the
  Adi-kavya.
