  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-ninth sarga, called “Bharata’s Evil Dream.”
'1': >-
  On that very night when those messengers entered the city, Bharata too, on
  that same night, beheld this unwelcome dream.
'2': >-
  When that night had just passed, having seen that dreadful and inauspicious
  dream, the son of the emperor (Daśaratha) was deeply afflicted and tormented
  with grief.
'3': >-
  Knowing him to be thus distressed, his companions—friends of pleasing
  speech—wishing to dispel his weariness, began various conversations in the
  assembly-hall.
'4': >-
  Some caused soothing music to be played; others set about dancing; others
  spoke of dramas, and of many kinds of mirthful entertainments as well.
'5': >-
  Yet that high-souled Bharata, the Rāghava, though surrounded by friends who
  spoke agreeably and were making merry with gatherings and jocular amusements,
  did not feel joy.
'6': >-
  Then a dear friend, seated near him among well-wishers and attendants, spoke
  to Bharata, who was encompassed by his companions: “Why, friend, do you not
  take delight?”
'7': >-
  Thus addressed by that friendly companion, Bharata replied: “Listen to the
  cause for which this dejection has come upon me.”
'8': >-
  In a dream I saw my father—soiled and unclean, with his hair loosened—falling
  from a mountain peak into a foul lake of cow-dung.
'9': >-
  And I saw him floating there in that lake of cow-dung, again and again as it
  were laughing, drinking oil with joined palms as an offering from his hands.
'10': >-
  Then, having eaten a meal of sesame-rice, again and again with his head bent
  downward, his entire body smeared with oil, he plunged into oil itself.
'11': >-
  Moreover, in the dream I saw the ocean dried up, and the moon fallen to the
  earth; and suddenly I saw the blazing fire (Jātavedas) quenched and
  extinguished.
'12': >-
  I saw the horn of the royal mount-elephant (the elephant used for riding)
  broken into fragments; and suddenly I saw the blazing fire, Jātavedas, become
  quenched and extinguished.
'13': >-
  I behold the earth as though rent and split, and many kinds of trees dried up;
  I see the mountains shattered, and also smoking.
'14': >-
  I saw the king seated upon an iron bench, clad in dark garments; and dark,
  tawny-eyed women were laughing at the king.
'15': >-
  And that righteous-souled one, wearing red garlands and unguents, hastening,
  went away in a chariot yoked with asses, facing south.
'16': >-
  Also I saw a woman, clad in red, as though laughing at the king—dragging
  him—(she was) a rākṣasī, with a deformed seat and frightful appearance.
'17': >-
  Thus did I see, during this night, this vision that brings terror. Either I,
  or Rāma, or the king, or Lakṣmaṇa will die.
'18': >-
  For the man who, in a dream, goes in a vehicle yoked with asses—before long,
  the smoke-top of his funeral pyre is seen (that is, his cremation follows
  soon).
'19': >-
  Because of this portent I am wretched; therefore I do not properly honor your
  entertainments. My throat feels as though it is drying up, and my mind is, as
  it were, not at ease.
'20': >-
  I do not perceive the exact seat or source of fear, yet I apprehend fear
  indeed. The harmony of my voice has failed, and my very shadow seems struck
  and impaired.
'21': >-
  I feel as though I loathe my own self, yet I see no reason for it. Having
  beheld this course of evil dreams—of many forms, not previously imagined—great
  fear will not leave my heart, as I ponder upon the king, whose appearance is
  beyond comprehension.
'22': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-ninth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the venerable, holy
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādikāvya, called “Bharata’s Evil Dream.”
