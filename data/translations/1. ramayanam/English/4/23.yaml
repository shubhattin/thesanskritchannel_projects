  Now begins the twenty-third canto of the Kishkindha-kanda in the holy
  Valmiki-Ramayana, entitled “Angada’s Salutation (to his father).”
'1': >-
  Thereafter Tara, renowned in the world as his wife, drew close and kissed the
  face of the lord of monkeys; and seeing him as one dead, she spoke these
  words.
'2': >-
  “While I yet remain, you lie here on this uneven, grievous earth, having not
  carried out my word, O hero, amid sorrow heaped upon sorrow.
'3': >-
  Surely this earth is dearer to you than I, O king of vanaras; for you lie
  embracing her, and you do not speak even to me.
'4': >-
  Ah, such is the ordinance of fate—now you have come under Sugriva’s power.
  Sugriva alone is valiant—O hero, you who were fond of daring deeds!
'5': >-
  The chiefs of bears and monkeys used to wait upon you, the mighty one; and
  there is now their hard lamentation, and Angada’s sorrow as well.
'6': >-
  Even after hearing these cries of mine, why do you not awaken? This is that
  very couch of heroes—here you lie, slain in battle.
'7': >-
  Here, where formerly your enemies lay laid low by you alone—O my beloved, of
  pure spirit and noble lineage, delighting in war!
'8': >-
  Leaving me alone, without protector, you have gone, O giver of honor. Indeed,
  a wise maiden should not be given to a warrior (for such is the end that
  befalls).
'9': >-
  Behold the wife of a hero struck down—me, made a widow at once. My honor has
  been shattered, and my everlasting refuge is broken.
'10': >-
  I am sunk in a vast, unfathomable ocean of grief. Surely my heart is firm,
  made as though of stone-essence, since it is not broken even now.
'11': >-
  Seeing my husband slain—he who is my friend as well as my lord, and by nature
  dear to me—why has my heart not today been shattered into a hundred pieces?
'12': >-
  Brave in attack and mighty in prowess, the hero has come to his end. But as
  for the woman bereft of her husband—though she may well have sons—what is that
  to her?
'13': >-
  Even though rich in wealth and grain, she is still called ‘widow’ by people. O
  hero, you lie upon a circle of blood born of your own body.
'14': >-
  As on one’s own bed there may be a heap of worms and dye-stained filth, so is
  your body on every side covered with dust and blood.
'15': >-
  I cannot embrace you with my arms, O bull among monkeys. Sugriva today has
  achieved his purpose in this most dreadful enmity.
'16': >-
  He whose fear was taken away by Rama’s released arrow—by the single shaft that
  pierced your heart—while your limbs yet could be touched.
'17': >-
  As I looked upon you, even when you had reached the state of death, I
  restrained myself; then Nila drew forth that arrow which had entered his body.
'18': >-
  Like a blazing venomous serpent lying hidden in a mountain-cave, even the
  splendor of that arrow, as it was being drawn out, became manifest.
'19': >-
  And from all his wounds, streams of blood fell everywhere—like the sun, whose
  rays are blocked at the setting by the mountain’s peak.
'20': >-
  Wiping away her lord who was strewn over with the dust of battle, those
  blood-streams—mingled with red ochre—appeared like rivulets flowing down from
  a mountain.
'21': >-
  With tears born of her eyes, she sprinkled the hero who had been struck by
  weapons; and seeing her husband slain, with all his limbs drenched in blood,
  she lamented.
'22': >-
  That lady Tara then spoke to her tawny-eyed son Angada: “Son, behold this last
  and most dreadful condition of your father.
'23': >-
  By sinful action, his end has come because of enmity that had clung and taken
  hold; his body, bright like the rising sun, has departed to the abode of Yama.
'24': >-
  ‘Salute the king—your father—O son, giver of honor!’ Thus addressed, Angada
  rose up and took hold of his father’s feet.
'25': >-
  With his two arms—full and rounded—saying, ‘I am Angada,’ he saluted you,
  Angada, just as he used to before.
'26': >-
  ‘May you be long-lived, my son’—why do you not speak this? I, together with
  your son, attend upon you who are bereft of consciousness—like a cow with her
  calf standing by a bull that has just been struck down by a lion.
'27': >-
  Having offered the sacrifice of battle, with Rama’s weapon as the
  oblation-water, and having bathed in that final bath—how have you done so
  without me, your wife?
'28': >-
  That beloved golden garland, given to you by Indra, lord of the gods, when he
  was pleased with you in battle—why do I not see it here upon you?
'29': >-
  The royal fortune does not abandon you even though life has departed, O giver
  of honor—like the radiance that does not leave the king of mountains when the
  sun is setting.
'30': >-
  This speech of mine is not wholesome—yet what you have done cannot be undone,
  nor am I able to restrain you. Slain am I with my son, since you were slain in
  battle; and with you, prosperity departs from me as well.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-third canto, called “Angada’s Salutation,” in the
  Kishkindha-kanda of the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, the Adi-Kavya.
