  Now begins the ninety-sixth chapter of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Lakṣmaṇa’s Wrath.”
'1': >-
  Having thus shown Maithilī (Sītā) the river that ran down from the mountain
  slopes, he sat upon a ledge of the mountain, delighting Sītā with meat (food
  of the chase).
'2': >-
  “This is wholesome; this is savoury; this has been well roasted by fire.” Thus
  did that righteous-souled Rāghava abide there together with Sītā.
'3': >-
  While he sat there, there appeared—belonging to Bharata who was drawing
  near—the dust raised by the army and the sound (of its march), both rising as
  though to touch the sky.
'4': >-
  In the meantime, frightened by that mighty din, the intoxicated leaders of the
  herds, along with their herds, ran swiftly in all directions, driven in
  terror.
'5': >-
  Rāghava heard that sound, raised by the stirring of the army, and he also
  beheld all those herd-leaders fleeing in alarm.
'6': >-
  Seeing them rushing away, and hearing that clamour, Rāma spoke to Saumitri
  Lakṣmaṇa, of blazing splendour:
'7': >-
  “Come, Lakṣmaṇa—behold! Sumitrā is blessed indeed in having you for her noble
  son. A dreadful, deep, tumultuous roar is being heard.”
'8': >-
  “Either herds of elephants in the forest, or buffaloes in the great woodland,
  or deer suddenly frightened by lions, have fled in all directions.”
'9': >-
  “Or else some king, or a royal prince, wanders in the forest in pursuit of the
  chase; or some other wild beast of prey—Saumitri, you ought to ascertain what
  it is.”
'10': >-
  “This mountain too is hard to traverse even for birds, O Lakṣmaṇa. You must
  learn all this truly and in full, without delay.”
'11': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa, hastening, climbed a blossoming sāla tree; and, looking out toward
  all quarters, he gazed to the eastern direction.
'12': >-
  Facing north as he observed, he saw a vast host—thick with chariots, horses,
  and elephants—marshalled together with those and with foot-soldiers.
'13': >-
  Beholding that army filled with horses and elephants, and adorned with
  chariots and banners, he reported it to Rāma, and spoke these words:
'14': >-
  “Let the noble one quench the fire, and let Sītā take refuge in a cave. String
  your bow, and make ready your arrows and your armour as well.”
'15': >-
  To him Lakṣmaṇa, the tiger among men, Rāma replied: “Saumitri, consider
  well—whose army do you deem this to be?”
'16': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa spoke—his eyes as though set on burning that
  host, like fire when it blazes in wrath:
'17': >-
  “Clearly, seeking to obtain the prosperous kingdom after receiving
  consecration (coronation), Bharata, Kaikeyī’s son, comes in order to slay us
  both.”
'18': >-
  “There—manifest as it is—stands a very great and splendid standard-tree
  (ensign); on the chariot, the banner bearing the emblem of the kovidāra
  shines, with its trunk raised aloft.”
'19': >-
  “These men ride swift-going horses at their pleasure; and these warriors,
  delighted, shine forth as they sit upon elephants.”
'20': >-
  “Let us both take up our bows and make for the mountain, which affords shelter
  to heroes; or else let us stand here itself, well-armoured and with weapons
  uplifted.”
'21': >-
  “Perhaps, in battle, the one whose banner bears the kovidāra might even come
  into our power.”
'22': >-
  “Perhaps I shall behold Bharata—because of whom this great calamity has
  befallen you, O Rāghava, and Sītā, and me as well.”
'23': >-
  “For whose sake you have been fallen from the kingdom, O Rāghava, from what
  was ever rightfully yours—this foe, the hero Bharata, has now arrived; to me
  he is fit to be slain.”
'24': >-
  “I see no fault, O Rāghava, in the slaying of Bharata. For in abandoning those
  who have formerly done harm, no adharma is incurred.”
'25': >-
  “Bharata is one who has committed former wrong, and he has cast away
  righteousness, O Rāghava. When he is slain, rule the entire earth without
  hindrance.”
'26': >-
  “Today may Kaikeyī—desirous of sovereignty—see her son slain in battle by me,
  stricken with exceeding grief, like a tree shattered by an elephant.”
'27': >-
  “And I shall slay Kaikeyī too, together with her adherents and her kinsmen.
  Let the earth be freed today from this great defilement.”
'28': >-
  “Today, O giver of honour, I shall loose this restrained wrath and this
  dishonour upon the enemy armies, like fire cast into thickets.”
'29': >-
  “Today I shall make this woodland of Citrakūṭa, by cleaving the bodies of
  enemies with sharp arrows, drenched in blood.”
'30': >-
  “May beasts of prey drag away the elephants and horses whose hearts are
  pierced by arrows—and the men too, slain by me.”
'31': >-
  “In a great battle I shall be fully quit of the debt I owe to my arrows and my
  bow. Having slain Bharata together with his army, I shall be satisfied—of this
  there is no doubt.”
'32': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-sixth chapter, called “Lakṣmaṇa’s Wrath,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
