  Now begins the thirty-second canto of Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Distribution of Wealth (Vitta-viśrāṇanam).”
'1': >-
  Then, having understood the command of his brother—pleasing and salutary—he
  went and swiftly entered the residence of Suyajña.
'2': >-
  Having bowed to that brāhmaṇa, Suyajña, who was abiding in his
  sacrificial-fire chamber, Lakṣmaṇa said: “Friend, come—see the house of the
  doer of arduous deeds.”
'3': >-
  Thereupon, having performed the evening worship, and going together with
  Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), he entered—prosperous and resplendent with fortune—the
  delightful dwelling of Rāma.
'4': >-
  With foremost ornaments fashioned of gold—armlets, auspicious
  earrings—together with golden necklaces and gems, with keyūras and bracelets
  as well,
'5': >-
  and with many other precious jewels besides, the scion of Kakutstha honored
  Suyajña. Then Rāma, urged by Sītā, spoke to Suyajña:
'6': >-
  “Take this necklace and this golden chain for your wife, gentle one. And Sītā,
  your friend, desires to give you a girdle as well.”
'7': >-
  “And these variegated arm-ornaments, and these auspicious keyūras—your friend
  offers them to you, for your wife, as she is going to the forest.”
'8': >-
  “A couch too, with excellent coverings, adorned with many kinds of jewels—this
  also Vaidehī indeed wishes you to establish in your house.”
'9': >-
  “This elephant named Śatruñjaya was given to me by my maternal uncle. I give
  him to you, O best of twice-born, along with a thousand niṣkas (gold coins).”
'10': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, Suyajña accepted those gifts, and then bestowed
  auspicious blessings upon Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and Sītā.
'11': >-
  Then Rāma—pleasing of speech—said to his beloved brother Saumitri, who stood
  untroubled, as Brahmā might speak to the lord of the gods:
'12': >-
  “Agastya and Kauśika—both those foremost of brāhmaṇas—honor them, Saumitri,
  inviting them and worshipping them with jewels as with water upon growing
  crops.”
'13': >-
  “Satisfy them, O mighty-armed Rāghava, with a thousand cows, and with gold and
  silver, and with gems of great value.”
'14': >-
  “And that teacher of the Taittirīya branch, of pleasing form and a knower of
  the Veda, who attends devotedly upon Kauśalyā with blessings—”
'15': >-
  “to him, Saumitri, present a carriage and maidservants, and silken garments—so
  much as will satisfy that brāhmaṇa.”
'16': >-
  “And the charioteer Citraratha, the venerable, long-resident minister—please
  him too with costly jewels, with garments, and likewise with wealth.”
'17': >-
  “With all kinds of livestock, and with a thousand cows; and those many
  staff-bearing youths of Kaṭhakālāpa (the Kaṭha school) as well—”
'18': >-
  “who, being ever devoted to Vedic study, do nothing else; indolent, fond of
  sweet things, and yet held in esteem even by the great—”
'19': >-
  “to them have eighty carriages, filled with treasures, given; and a thousand
  śālīvāha (conveyances/vehicles), and two hundred fine bhadraka (horses) as
  well.”
'20': >-
  “And for provisions, Saumitri, make ready a thousand cows. A great multitude
  of Mekhalī-brāhmaṇas has arrived to Kauśalyā; to them, Saumitri, give a
  thousand to each individually.”
'21': >-
  “So that our mother Kauśalyā may not grieve at my gift, in every way honor all
  those twice-born, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'22': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, the tiger among men, himself gave that wealth to the foremost
  of brāhmaṇas exactly as had been spoken—like Kubera (the lord of riches)
  bestowing treasure.
'23': >-
  Thereafter, with voice choked with tears, he spoke to the dependents who stood
  by, giving abundant wealth—each one’s means of livelihood to each one.
'24': >-
  “Let neither Lakṣmaṇa’s house nor this house of mine be without provision—let
  each be attended to until my return.”
'25': >-
  Having thus spoken to all those sorrowful dependents, he said this to the
  superintendent of wealth: “Let my treasure be brought.”
'26': >-
  Then all the dependents brought his wealth. There a very great heap was
  seen—indeed, a sight to behold.
'27': >-
  Then that tiger among men, together with Lakṣmaṇa, caused that wealth to be
  given to brāhmaṇas—to children and to the aged, and indeed to the destitute.
'28': >-
  There was there a twice-born named Tri-jaṭa of the Gārgya lineage—living in
  poverty, ever dwelling in the forest, with ploughshare, spade, and plough for
  his means.
'29': >-
  His young wife, taking along their little children, spoke these words to the
  aged brāhmaṇa—for to women, the husband is verily a deity:
'30': >-
  “Cast aside the ploughshare and the spade; do my bidding. Go and see Rāma, the
  knower of dharma—if you obtain anything at all.”
'31': >-
  Hearing his wife’s words, and covering himself with a difficult-to-cover
  ragged cloth, he set out upon the road leading to where Rāma’s dwelling was.
'32': >-
  Tri-jaṭa, whose radiance was equal to that of Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras, entered the
  public assembly. Up to the fifth courtyard none barred him—no one stopped him.
'33': >-
  Then, reaching Rāma, Tri-jaṭa spoke: “I am poor, with many sons, O prince, O
  mighty-armed one.”
'34': >-
  “I live by gleaning in the forest every day—look upon me with favor.” Then
  Rāma said to him, with a touch of playful jest:
'35': >-
  “Not even a single thousand of cows has been given by me. Throw your staff
  around (as a boundary); as far as it reaches, so far you shall obtain.”
'36': >-
  Then, bewildered with excitement, he wound his cloth around his waist, and
  whirling his staff, he cast it with all his strength and speed.
'37': >-
  Crossing the bank of the Sarayū, the staff slipped from his hand and fell in a
  cow-pen containing many thousands, near a bull.
'38': >-
  Then the righteous-souled (Rāma), embracing him, brought from that bank of the
  Sarayū those cows toward Tri-jaṭa’s hermitage.
'39': >-
  And then Rāma spoke, consoling that Gārgya: “Truly, no anger should be made;
  this was my jest.”
'40': >-
  “For this invincible splendor of yours—this very thing I wished to test.
  Therefore, O sir, urged by this intention, choose anything else that you
  firmly desire.”
'41': >-
  “I speak the truth: there was no torment meant for you. Whatever wealth is
  mine has come about because of brāhmaṇas; by duly presenting it among men like
  you, it will become for me a source of renown.”
'42': >-
  Then the great sage Tri-jaṭa, together with his wife, receiving that multitude
  of cows, rejoiced; and he returned blessings to that great-souled
  one—blessings that increase fame, strength, delight, and happiness.
'43': >-
  And Rāma too, complete in manly vigor, directed that great wealth—acquired by
  the power of dharma—toward his friends and kinsmen of long standing, prompted
  by words of due honor.
'44': >-
  Whether brāhmaṇa, friend, servant, or one who then lived by beggary and
  poverty—there was none there who was not satisfied, through due honor, gifts,
  and diligent consideration.
'45': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-second canto of Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the venerable, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the primal epic, entitled “The Distribution of Wealth
  (Vitta-viśrāṇanam).”
