  Now begins the eighty-second canto, called “The Dispatching of the Army,” in
  the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Bharata, endowed with intelligence, beheld that assembly-hall which was filled
  with companies of noble men—shining, as it were, like the night made perfect
  by the full moon.
'2': >-
  As the venerable elders entered and took their seats according to due order,
  the hall appeared—like the night when the clouds have dispersed—bright as
  though illumined by the full moon.
'3': >-
  That splendid assembly, crowded with learned men, was then seen to resemble
  the cloudless night, radiant like the full moon.
'4': >-
  Then the family priest, knower of righteousness, having looked upon all the
  king’s subjects and ministers gathered together, spoke these gentle words to
  Bharata:
'5': >-
  “Dear child, King Daśaratha, practising dharma, has gone to heaven, having
  bestowed upon you this earth—rich in wealth and grain, and flourishing in
  every way.
'6': >-
  And Rāma too—firm in truth, remembering the dharma of the righteous—did not
  abandon his father’s command, even as the moon, when risen, does not forsake
  its own moonlight.
'7': >-
  This kingdom, bestowed on you by your father and by your brother—freed from
  thorns and obstacles—enjoy it with your ministers rejoicing, and have yourself
  consecrated without delay.”
'8': >-
  “Let those of the northern quarters, the western quarters, and the southern
  regions alike—men from the farthest bounds of the coasts and the ocean—bring
  you treasures and jewels.”
'9': >-
  Hearing those words, Bharata—overwhelmed by grief—turned his mind to Rāma,
  yearning for dharma, being himself a knower of righteousness.
'10': >-
  Then the young prince, his speech broken into fragments by tears, his voice
  like the cry of a swan, lamented in the midst of the assembly and reproached
  the priest:
'11': >-
  “How could one such as I seize a kingdom—when I have observed brahmacarya,
  completed my studies, am possessed of understanding, and strive ever in
  dharma?
'12': >-
  How could one born of Daśaratha become a robber of the kingdom? It is meet
  that you speak here of dharma: both the kingdom and I belong to Rāma.”
'13': >-
  “The eldest, the best—righteous in soul, comparable to Dilīpa and Nahuṣa—that
  Kakutstha prince deserves to obtain the kingdom, just as Daśaratha did.
'14': >-
  If I were to commit such sin—favoured by the ignoble and leading not to
  heaven—I would become in the world a stain upon the lineage of the Ikṣvākus.
'15': >-
  That sin which was wrought by my mother—I do not approve of it. Remaining
  here, I bow with joined hands to him who dwells in the forest fastness.
'16': >-
  Rāma alone will I follow; he is king, the best of men. Rāghava is worthy of
  kingship over all the three worlds.
'17': >-
  Hearing that speech, consonant with dharma, all the members of the
  assembly—having their hearts set on Rāma—shed tears of joy.
'18': >-
  “But if I am unable to bring back the noble one from the forest, then there in
  the forest itself will I dwell, even as the noble Lakṣmaṇa does.
'19': >-
  Before these eminent nobles—virtuous men, established in good qualities—I
  shall employ every means to bring him back, even by force.
'20': >-
  All the workers attached to compulsory service, all the road-clearers and
  guards—I have already dispatched them beforehand; and now this journey also is
  pleasing to my heart.”
'21': >-
  Having spoken thus, Bharata—righteous-souled and affectionate to his
  brother—addressed Sumantṛa nearby, skilled in counsel, saying:
'22': >-
  “Rise quickly, Sumantṛa, and go at once by my command. Order the march without
  delay, and assemble the army as well.”
'23': >-
  Thus addressed by the great-souled Bharata, Sumantṛa, delighted, set
  everything in motion exactly as he had been instructed, according to desire.
'24': >-
  The subjects, the officers over the troops, and the army itself—hearing that
  the expedition had been ordered for bringing Rāghava back—were filled with
  joy.
'25': >-
  Then all the women of the warriors, in every house, understanding that their
  husbands must depart on the march, urged them on in haste, rejoicing.
'26': >-
  With swift horses, and with cattle and chariots, with carriages of mind-like
  speed—together with the warriors—the commanders drove forward the whole army.
'27': >-
  Seeing that army made ready, Bharata, in the presence of the elders, spoke to
  Sumantṛa at his side: “Make my chariot ready at once.”
'28': >-
  Receiving Bharata’s command, Sumantṛa, greatly delighted, took the chariot and
  set forth—yoked with excellent steeds.
'29': >-
  Then Bharata, firm in truth and mighty in splendour, steadfast in true valour,
  spoke—meaning to win the favour of the illustrious Rāghava who had gone to the
  great forest, his revered elder, and to bring him back.
'30': >-
  “Rise quickly, Sumantṛa, and go. For the mustering of the army, summon the
  leaders of the forces. For I desire to bring back that one who dwells in the
  forest—having reconciled Rāma—for the welfare of the whole world.”
'31': >-
  Thus properly commanded by Bharata, the charioteer’s son—his purpose fully
  satisfied—issued orders to all the foremost men among the citizens and
  ministers, as well as to the chiefs of the army and to the circle of friends.
'32': >-
  Then, rising up, in family after family, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, śūdras, and
  brāhmaṇas yoked camels and wagons and asses, and elephants and horses
  also—born in noble lines.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-second canto, called “The Dispatching of the Army,” in
  the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
