  Now begins the thirty-sixth sarga, named “The Taking of Sītā to the Bank of
  the Gaṅgā,” in the Uttarakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then, when the night had passed and dawn had come, Lakṣmaṇa—his mind dejected
  and his face dried up (with grief)—spoke these words to Sumantra.
'2': >-
  “O charioteer, yoke the horses quickly to the excellent chariot. From the
  royal palace prepare, with proper coverings, a seat for Sītā.”
'3': >-
  “For Sītā—by the king’s command—must be taken by me to the hermitages of the
  holy-souled sages who perform meritorious rites. Let the chariot be brought at
  once.”
'4': >-
  Sumantra, saying, “So be it,” had the splendid, exceedingly beautiful chariot
  harnessed with the best of steeds, and made it well-spread with a comfortable
  couch.
'5': >-
  Having brought it, Sumantra—ever a promoter of men and a friend among
  friends—said to the son of Sumitrā: “The chariot has arrived. Let that which
  must be done now be done, O lord.”
'6': >-
  Thus addressed by Sumantra, Lakṣmaṇa entered the royal residence; and
  approaching Sītā, that bull among men spoke.
'7': >-
  “Indeed, by you the lordly king has been requested for a boon; and by the king
  it has been promised, and an order has been given toward the hermitage.”
'8': >-
  “On the bank of the Gaṅgā, O goddess—O Vaidehī—having gone quickly at the
  command of our sovereign, to the auspicious hermitages of the sages, you will
  be led by me into the forest, a region frequented by ascetics.”
'9': >-
  When thus spoken to by great-souled Lakṣmaṇa, Vaidehī obtained incomparable
  delight, and she approved the journey as well.
'10': >-
  Taking with her most precious garments and various jewels, Vaidehī then set
  herself to make ready for departure.
'11': >-
  “These ornaments I shall give to the wives of the sages,” she said, “and also
  excellent garments and various kinds of wealth.”
'12': >-
  Then the son of Sumitrā, saying “So be it,” placed Maithilī upon the chariot,
  and set out with swift horses, remembering Rāma’s command.
'13': >-
  At that time Sītā spoke to Lakṣmaṇa, increaser of prosperity: “O delight of
  the Raghus, I behold many inauspicious signs.”
'14': >-
  “My left eye throbs today, and trembling arises in my limbs; and, O Saumitrī,
  I perceive my heart as though unwell.”
'15': >-
  “A great restlessness and also extreme unsteadiness have come upon me; and, O
  wide-eyed one, I see the earth itself as though empty.”
'16': >-
  “May there be well-being for your brother—O devoted to your brother—and for
  all my mothers-in-law as well, O hero, without exception.”
'17': >-
  “And may there be welfare in the city and the countryside, and for living
  beings also.” Having thus spoken, Sītā, with hands joined in reverence,
  entreated the deities.
'18': >-
  Hearing her meaning, Lakṣmaṇa bowed his head in salutation to Maithilī, and,
  though his heart was parched (with sorrow), he replied with forced cheer: “It
  shall be auspicious.”
'19': >-
  Then, having reached a dwelling at the hermitage on the bank of the Gomati, at
  daybreak Saumitrī rose again and spoke to the charioteer.
'20': >-
  “Yoke the chariot quickly. Today I shall bear upon my head the waters of the
  Bhāgīrathī, as (Lord) Tryambaka bears (them) upon the mountain.”
'21': >-
  Thereupon the charioteer yoked four swift-minded horses to the chariot and,
  with joined palms, said to Vaidehī, “Ascend.”
'22': >-
  At the charioteer’s word she mounted the excellent chariot—Sītā together with
  Saumitrī and with the wise Sumantra.
'23': >-
  The large-eyed lady reached the Gaṅgā, the destroyer of sins, after journeying
  for half a day to the reservoir-like waters of the Bhāgīrathī.
'24': Beholding it, Lakṣmaṇa—wretched—burst into loud weeping.
'25': >-
  But Sītā, wholly self-possessed, seeing Lakṣmaṇa distressed, spoke this
  word—she who knew dharma well: “What is this? Why do you weep?”
'26': >-
  “Having reached the bank of the Jāhnavī, which I have long desired, why, at a
  time of joy, do you cast me into sorrow, O Lakṣmaṇa?”
'27': >-
  “You ever remain at Rāma’s side, O best of men. Have you been separated from
  him that, for two nights, you have fallen into grief?”
'28': >-
  “Rāma too is dear to me even more than life, O Lakṣmaṇa; yet I do not grieve
  thus. Do not be foolish like this.”
'29': >-
  “Ferry me across the Gaṅgā and show me the ascetics. Then I shall give to the
  sages these garments and ornaments.”
'30': >-
  “Thereafter, having paid due reverence to the great sages as is fitting, and
  having spent one night there, we shall go again to that city.”
'31': >-
  “My mind hastens to see Rāma—lotus-eyed, lion-chested, slender-waisted—the
  best of those who delight the heart.”
'32': >-
  Hearing her words, Lakṣmaṇa wiped his auspicious eyes (and their tears) and
  called for the boatmen—he, the slayer of hostile heroes.
'33': 'And the fishermen, with joined palms, said: “This boat too is ready.”'
'34': >-
  Desiring to cross the auspicious Gaṅgā, Lakṣmaṇa boarded the boat; and,
  composed in mind, Lakṣmaṇa ferried her across the Gaṅgā.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-sixth sarga, named “The Taking of Sītā to the Bank of the
  Gaṅgā,” in the Uttarakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
