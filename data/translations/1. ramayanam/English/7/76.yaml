  Now begins the seventy‑sixth canto of the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Slaying of Śambūka.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words of Rāma—whose deeds were unfailing—he became downcast,
  with head bowed; and, being in that state, he spoke this speech.
'2': >-
  “I am born of a Śūdra womb; by name I am called Śambūka. O Rāma of great
  renown, I seek godhood—while still embodied.”
'3': >-
  “I do not speak falsely, O Rāma, with the desire of conquering the world of
  the gods. Know me, O Kākutstha, to be a Śūdra, engaged in fierce austerity.”
'4': >-
  While that Śūdra was thus speaking, Rāghava drew from its sheath a sword of
  most pleasing radiance, stainless and bright, and cut off his head.
'5': >-
  When that Śūdra had been slain, the gods—with Indra among them and with Agni
  at their head—again and again praised Kākutstha, crying, “Well done! Well
  done!”
'6': >-
  A mighty rain of divine, exquisitely fragrant flowers then fell on every
  side—flowers released and borne by the wind.
'7': >-
  Greatly delighted, the gods spoke to Rāma, whose prowess was founded in truth:
  “This deed, gentle one, has been accomplished for the sake of the gods; O
  great‑minded one, it has been well done by you.”
'8': >-
  “Choose a boon, gentle one—whatever you desire, O subduer of foes. For by your
  act, O delight of the Raghus, this Śūdra shall not attain heaven.”
'9': >-
  Hearing the speech of the gods, Rāghava—composed and well‑collected—spoke with
  joined palms to the thousand‑eyed Purandara (Indra):
'10': >-
  “If the gods are pleased with me, let that Brāhmaṇa’s son live. Grant me this
  boon—this highest desire of mine.”
'11': >-
  “Because of my transgression, that only son of a Brāhmaṇa—though not yet at
  the time appointed—has been borne off by Time to the abode of Vaivasvata
  (Yama).”
'12': >-
  “Restore him to life—prosperity to you! You ought not to make my words untrue.
  The purpose I promised to that twice‑born man is: ‘I shall bring your son to
  life.’”
'13': >-
  Hearing Rāghava’s words, the best of the wise (the gods), pleased and filled
  with joy, replied to Rāghava:
'14': >-
  “Be satisfied, O Kākutstha. On this very day that boy has regained his life
  and has also been reunited with his kinsmen.”
'15': >-
  “At the very moment, O Kākutstha, when this Śūdra was struck down, at that
  same moment that boy was joined again with life.”
'16': >-
  “May welfare attend you; good be to you. Let us go, O bull among men. We wish,
  O Rāghava, to see the hermitage‑abode of Agastya.”
'17': >-
  “For the consecration (dīkṣā) of that brahmarṣi of very great splendor is
  complete; twelve years have passed while he has lain upon a bed of water.”
'18': >-
  “O Kākutstha, let us go to greet and honor that sage. And you too come—good be
  to you—to behold that foremost of ṛṣis.”
'19': >-
  Saying, “So be it,” and giving his assent to the gods, the delight of the
  Raghus mounted that Puṣpaka aerial car, adorned with gold.
'20': >-
  Then those gods set forth in their wide‑spreading aerial chariots; and Rāma
  too quickly followed toward the penance‑grove of the son of Kumbha (Agastya).
'21': >-
  Seeing the gods arrived, Agastya—treasury of austerities—righteous‑souled,
  honored them all without distinction.
'22': >-
  Having received that worship, and having duly honored the great sage, the
  thirty‑three gods (the Tridaśas), rejoicing, went to heaven with their
  followers.
'23': >-
  After they had departed, Kākutstha descended from Puṣpaka and then paid
  reverence to Agastya, the foremost of sages.
'24': >-
  Having saluted that great‑souled one, blazing as it were with splendor, and
  having obtained the highest hospitality, the lord of men sat down.
'25': >-
  To him spoke the mighty‑splendored Agastya, the son of Kumbha, of great
  austerities: “Welcome to you, best of men; by good fortune you have come, O
  Rāghava.”
'26': >-
  “You are greatly esteemed by me, O Rāma, for many excellent virtues. You are a
  guest worthy of honor; and you ever abide in my heart.”
'27': >-
  “The gods declare that you have come, having slain a Śūdra; and by you, in
  accordance with dharma, the son of that Brāhmaṇa has been brought back to
  life.”
'28': >-
  “Stay here for this night in my presence, O Rāghava. At dawn, in Puṣpaka, you
  shall indeed go to the city.”
'29': >-
  “For you are Nārāyaṇa, glorious; in you all is established. You are the lord
  of all the gods; you are the eternal Puruṣa.”
'30': >-
  “And this ornament, gentle one, fashioned by Viśvakarman, is divine—shining
  with its own brilliance, resplendent with a divine form. Accept it, O
  Kākutstha; do what is dear to me, O Rāghava.”
'31': >-
  “For it is said that there is very great fruit in giving again what has been
  given. Moreover, you are able to bear even what belongs to Indra and the
  Maruts.”
'32': >-
  “You are indeed able to deliver even Indra and the dwellers in heaven;
  therefore I shall bestow it upon you according to rite—accept it, O lord of
  men.”
'33': It was a divine, wondrous ornament, blazing like the sun.
'34': >-
  Then Rāma—the great charioteer among the Ikṣvākus, the best of the
  discerning—addressed that great‑souled sage, recalling the dharma of
  kṣatriyas:
'35': >-
  “This receiving of gifts, O Blessed One, is not censured in the case of a
  Brāhmaṇa. But how may I, a kṣatriya, accept it, O foremost of Brāhmaṇas?”
'36': >-
  “Since it is especially given by a Brāhmaṇa, you ought to tell me (what is
  proper).” Thus spoken to by Rāma, the great ṛṣi replied:
'37': >-
  “In the Kṛta Yuga, O Rāma, in the ancient age when Brahmanhood prevailed, all
  peoples were without kings; and among the gods, Śatakratu (Indra) was (their
  ruler).”
'38': >-
  “Those subjects approached the god of gods, seeking a king; and among the
  gods, Śatakratu was established as king by you, O god.”
'39': >-
  “‘Grant us, O lord of the world, a king upon the earth—a bull among men—by
  worshipping whom we may live, our sins shaken off. We will not dwell without a
  king; this is our final resolve.’”
'40': Hearing the words of the subjects, and having determined the highest purpose,
'41': >-
  then Brahmā, the best of the gods, having summoned the guardians of the worlds
  together with Vāsava (Indra), said to them all: “Bestow portions of your
  splendor.”
'42': >-
  Then all the guardians of the worlds gave portions of their own radiance; and
  then Brahmā created a ‘kṣupa’—from which a kṣupa (king) was born.
'43': >-
  Him Brahmā joined with the portions of the guardians of the worlds; then he
  gave to those subjects that kṣupa as king, their lord.
'44': >-
  There, with Indra’s portion, the king ruled over the earth; with Varuṇa’s
  portion, the sovereign’s body thrives and is nourished.
'45': >-
  With Kubera’s portion, he then bestowed wealth upon them; and whatever portion
  belonged to Yama—by that he indeed governed and chastised the subjects.
'46': >-
  Therefore, with that Indra‑portion, O best of men—O delight of the
  Raghus—accept it; good be to you, O lord, for my deliverance.”
'47': >-
  Hearing those supremely righteous words of the sage, Rāma accepted that
  excellent ornament from the muni.
'48': >-
  Having accepted that best ornament, Rāma then began to inquire about the
  origin of that radiant object.
'49': >-
  “This is exceedingly marvelous, divine, endowed with incomparable beauty. How
  did the Blessed One obtain it—and from where, and by whom, was it brought?”
'50': >-
  “Out of curiosity, O Brahman, I ask you, O greatly renowned one; for you are
  the supreme treasury of many wonders.”
'51': >-
  As Kākutstha spoke thus, the sage then said: “Hear, O Rāma, how it came to
  pass in former times, in the Tretā Yuga.”
'52': >-
  “In this delightful region of the forest, what I once saw—marvelous, O
  mighty‑armed one—rested solely upon an act of giving (dāna).”
'53': >-
  Thus ends the seventy‑sixth canto of the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Slaying of Śambūka.”
