  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa, the eleventh sarga,
  called “The Examination of the Drinking-Hall (Pāna-bhūmi).”
'1': >-
  Shaking off that thought, the mighty monkey then became steady once more, and
  turned his mind to another reflection concerning Sītā.
'2': >-
  That fair lady, separated from Rāma, is not fit to sleep—nor to eat, nor even
  to adorn herself, nor to resort to drinking.
'3': >-
  Nor would she approach any other man—no, not even the lord of the gods; for
  none equal to Rāma is found, even among the thirty-three gods.
'4': >-
  Determining, “This is someone else,” the best of monkeys moved about there
  again, eager for the sight of Sītā, traversing the drinking-hall.
'5': >-
  Some women were wearied by play; others, likewise, by song; others were
  fatigued by dance; and so too were some overcome by drinking.
'6': >-
  Some women were lying near drums and mṛdaṅgas and stringed instruments; others
  were seated upon the chief of spreads and coverings, resting upon couches and
  bedding.
'7': >-
  There, amid a thousand women—adorned with ornaments—skilled in beauty and in
  charming conversation, speaking words that matched the sense of the songs,
'8': >-
  uttering speech well-suited to place and time, speaking apt and fitting words,
  and joined to an abundance of delight—thus did the leader of the monkey-host
  behold that scene.
'9': >-
  Elsewhere too he saw a thousand youthful women of excellent beauty, of
  pleasing speech and repose, all asleep.
'10': >-
  And that same company—whose talk was suited to place and time, whose speech
  was well-formed—he saw lying asleep, not yet disengaged from dalliance.
'11': >-
  In their midst the broad-armed lord of the rākṣasas shone forth, like a bull
  among the chief cows in a great cattle-pen.
'12': >-
  That king of rākṣasas himself shone, surrounded by them, like a great elephant
  in a forest encircled by female elephants.
'13': >-
  The tiger among monkeys beheld, in the house of that lord of rākṣasas, that
  drinking-hall of the high-souled one, furnished with every pleasure.
'14': >-
  There in the drinking-hall he saw portions of meats laid out—of deer, of
  buffalo, and of boar—distributed in shares.
'15': And in broad golden vessels also he saw peacocks and cocks, not yet eaten.
'16': >-
  Hanumān observed boar-sausages and other preparations mixed with curd and
  souvarcala salt, and also porcupines, deer, and peacocks.
'17': >-
  He saw various lizards, goats of many kinds, and hares partly eaten; and
  buffaloes pierced with many spits, and rams set out and made ready.
'18': >-
  He saw lickables of many sorts, drinks of many sorts, and foods of many sorts;
  and also various sour and salty condiments, with diverse delights and
  sweetmeats.
'19': >-
  There were great anklets and armlets of immense value cast aside, and
  drinking-vessels thrown about, and fruits too of many kinds scattered here and
  there.
'20': >-
  The ground, made splendid with offerings of flowers, increased its beauty
  exceedingly; and in many places were arranged well-made beds and seats closely
  set.
'21': >-
  The drinking-hall appeared as though blazing, even without fire—so richly was
  it prepared with many kinds of excellent and varied refinements.
'22': >-
  There were meats, separately placed, well-prepared with skill; and there were
  divine, clear, varied wines—fine liquors and also stronger spirits.
'23': >-
  There were sugar-ferments and honey-liquors, flower-ferments and
  fruit-ferments; and they were made delicious with diverse scented powders,
  each prepared separately.
'24': >-
  The expanse of the hall shone continuously, with many garlands placed about;
  and with golden pitchers and with crystal vessels as well.
'25': >-
  It was further adorned with other ewers made of Jāmbūnada gold, and with
  shining jars and pitchers, likewise of Jāmbūnada gold.
'26': >-
  There the monkey beheld that foremost of drinking-grounds, and he saw vessels
  of fine gold and also jewel-made containers of sīdhu (strong liquor).
'27': >-
  Those vessels—some full—were seen by the mighty monkey; some were with half
  remaining; and some had been drunk up entirely.
'28': >-
  In some places he saw drinks not yet tasted at all; in some places various
  foods; and in some places drinks set out in portions.
'29': >-
  Seeing some half-left remnants, he moved about indeed; and elsewhere he saw
  many couches of women left empty again and again; while some noble ladies
  slept, clasping one another.
'30': >-
  And one frail woman, having taken another’s garment, embraced it and, drawing
  near, slept—overpowered by the might of sleep.
'31': >-
  By the breeze of their breathing, the garments and garlands upon their bodies
  scarcely stirred—strangely—like when a gentle wind has touched them.
'32': >-
  Of cool sandalwood, of the sweet essence of sīdhu, and of garlands of many
  kinds, and of flowers of many kinds—
'33': >-
  the wind carried manifold fragrances in many ways, thick with the scents of
  bathing, of sandal, and of incense.
'34': >-
  Then, in the Puṣpaka aerial palace, that fragrant perfume blew; and there were
  some women dark, some fair-dark, and some black—noble ladies.
'35': >-
  And some maidens in the dwelling of the rākṣasas were golden-hued of body;
  and, because they were under the power of sleep, they lay in a swoon, as
  though overcome by passion.
'36': >-
  The beauty of those lotus-eyed women as they slept was just as it had been;
  thus the radiant monkey saw, without remainder, all of Rāvaṇa’s inner
  apartments—yet he did not behold Jānakī.
'37': >-
  And while observing those women, that mighty monkey fell into a great doubt,
  apprehensive of righteousness and troubled by fear of adharma.
'38': >-
  “To look upon another man’s women while they lie asleep—this, indeed, will
  cause for me an excessive lapse from dharma.”
'39': >-
  “For my glance toward other men’s wives is not one that dwells upon objects of
  sense; yet here by me has been seen the keeping of others’ wives.”
'40': >-
  Then another thought arose in the wise one—whose resolve was single and
  fixed—revealing to him the certainty of what must be done.
'41': >-
  “Granted, I have seen all these women belonging to Rāvaṇa and trusted in his
  house; yet in my mind no विकृति—no perversion or disturbance—arises at all.”
'42': >-
  “For the mind indeed is the cause of the activity of all the senses, in states
  auspicious and inauspicious; and mine is well-established and rightly
  ordered.”
'43': >-
  “Elsewhere, indeed, I cannot search for Vaidehī; for women are always to be
  sought among women, in such a searching.”
'44': >-
  “In whatever womb a being is born, in that very kind it is sought; it is not
  possible to search for a lost woman among female deer.”
'45': >-
  “Therefore this searching so far has been done by me with a pure mind; I see
  all of Rāvaṇa’s inner apartments, yet Jānakī is not seen.”
'46': >-
  Hanumān, the mighty one, looking even upon the daughters of gods and
  gandharvas, and upon daughters of nāgas, still did not see Jānakī.
'47': >-
  Not seeing her there, though seeing other excellent women, the hero then
  withdrew and began to set forth to depart.
'48': >-
  Then the illustrious son of the Wind-god, taking up effort once more and
  searching on every side, left that drinking-hall behind and set about to
  explore elsewhere.
'49': >-
  Thus ends the eleventh sarga, called “The Examination of the Drinking-Hall
  (Pāna-bhūmi),” in Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the first of
  poems.
