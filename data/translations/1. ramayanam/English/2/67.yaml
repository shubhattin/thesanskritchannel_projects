  Now begins the sixty-seventh canto in the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Description of the Calamitous Condition under
  Kinglessness.”
'1': >-
  That night passed in Ayodhyā, overwhelmed and spread everywhere with
  wailing—its people joyless, their throats choked with sobs, their faces
  stained with tears.
'2': >-
  When the night had passed and, thereafter, the sun arose, the twice-born
  elders—men who were the makers of kings—assembled together and went to the
  council-hall.
'3': >-
  Mārkaṇḍeya, and then Maudgalya, and Vāmadeva and Kāśyapa; Kātyāyana and
  Gautama; and Jābāli too, of great renown—
'4': >-
  these twice-born sages, together with the ministers, each spoke separately,
  all facing Vasiṣṭha alone—the foremost royal priest.
'5': >-
  “This night that has passed has been to us a sorrow like a hundred years,
  since the king, through grief for his son, has gone to his end.
'6': >-
  The great king has gone to heaven; and Rāma has taken refuge in the forest;
  and the radiant Lakṣmaṇa too has gone along with Rāma.
'7': >-
  Both Bharata and Śatrughna, men of supreme austerity, are in the Kekaya
  country, in the delightful royal palace—in their maternal grandfather’s
  dwelling.
'8': >-
  Therefore, even today, let someone be appointed king among the Ikṣvāku line,
  so that our realm, being without a king, may not fall into ruin.
'9': >-
  In a country without a king, Parjanya the rain-god does not shower the earth
  with heavenly waters, accompanied by lightning, garlanded with clouds, and
  roaring mightily.
'10': >-
  In a country without a king, seed is not sown in handfuls; and in a country
  without a king, neither son remains obedient to father, nor wife to husband’s
  control.
'11': >-
  In a country without a king there is no wealth; and in a country without a
  king there is no wife either. And what is even more dangerous than this—how
  could truth itself exist where there is no king?
'12': >-
  In a country without a king, men do not build assembly-halls; nor, rejoicing,
  do they create lovely pleasure-gardens and houses for holy purposes.
'13': >-
  In a country without a king, the twice-born, devoted to sacrifice—the
  restrained brāhmaṇas of well-observed vows—do not sit to conduct sacrificial
  sessions (sattras).
'14': >-
  In a country without a king, sacrificers do not perform great sacrifices, nor
  do prosperous brāhmaṇas distribute the well-earned sacrificial fees
  (dakṣiṇās).
'15': >-
  In a country without a king, festivals and public gatherings that increase the
  kingdom do not flourish, nor do there abound actors and dancers in great
  number.
'16': >-
  In a country without a king, successful merchants and men engaged in
  transactions do not delight in conversations—though fond of discourse and
  lovers of pleasing tales.
'17': >-
  In a country without a king, maidens adorned with gold ornaments do not go at
  evening to gather in the gardens for sport.
'18': >-
  In a country without a king, men—lovers accompanied by women—do not ride out
  swiftly in fast-moving vehicles to the forests.
'19': >-
  In a country without a king, the wealthy do not sleep in safety with their
  doors left open—those who live by agriculture and by the tending and
  protection of cattle.
'20': >-
  In a country without a king, sixty-year-old elephants, with bells and horns
  bound on, do not roam along the royal highways.
'21': >-
  In a country without a king, the sound is not heard of arrows being shot
  continuously, nor the clang on the practice-ground where missile-weapons are
  trained in.
'22': >-
  In a country without a king, merchants who travel far do not go upon secure
  roads, richly furnished with the accumulations of many meritorious deeds.
'23': >-
  In a country without a king, a self-controlled sage who wanders alone does not
  move about, contemplating within himself—wherever at evening he may make his
  dwelling.
'24': >-
  In a country without a king, the securing of what one has and the acquiring of
  what one lacks (yoga and kṣema) do not proceed; nor, in a kingless land, does
  an army withstand enemies in battle.
'25': >-
  In a country without a king, men do not ride swiftly in well-adorned chariots
  drawn by joyous and excellent horses.
'26': >-
  In a country without a king, men skilled in the śāstras do not come to settle
  and dwell—whether in forests or in groves.
'27': >-
  In a country without a king, wreaths, sweetmeats, and sacrificial gifts are
  not duly prepared by disciplined people for the worship of the deities.
'28': >-
  In a country without a king, princes anointed with sandal and aloe do not
  shine forth like trees in springtime.
'29': >-
  As rivers without water, as a forest without grass, and as cows without
  cowherds—so is a kingdom without a king.
'30': >-
  A banner is the mark of a chariot; smoke is the mark of fire. The one who was
  our banner—the king—has departed from here to the state of the gods.
'31': >-
  In a country without a king, nothing remains truly one’s own for anyone; men
  continually devour one another like fishes.
'32': >-
  Even those who have broken all boundaries, who are unbelieving, and who are
  without hesitation or doubt— even they come to good order when oppressed by
  the king’s punishment.
'33': >-
  As sight functions constantly for the body, so is the lord of men the source
  for a kingdom’s prosperity in truth and righteousness.
'34': >-
  The king is truth and the king is dharma; the king is the lineage of those who
  have noble lineages. The king is mother and father as well; the king is the
  benefactor of men.
'35': >-
  Yama, Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera), Śakra (Indra), and mighty Varuṇa are surpassed by a
  ruler through his conduct, O great sage.
'36': >-
  Alas! This would become sheer darkness; nothing at all could be rightly
  discerned, if there were no king in the world to distinguish the good from the
  bad.
'37': >-
  Even while the great king lived, we all did not overstep your word—like the
  ocean that does not transgress its shore.
'38': >-
  Therefore, having considered our plight, O best of twice-born—this kingdom,
  without a sovereign, has become like a wilderness. You yourself should anoint
  here as king the generous prince, the son of the Ikṣvākus.
'39': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-seventh canto in the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic, entitled “The Description of the
  Calamitous Condition under Kinglessness.”
