'0': >-
  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara Kāṇḍa,
  begins the nineteenth sarga, entitled “The Curse of Anaraṇya.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, having subdued Marutta, that lord of the rākṣasas—Daśānana (the
  Ten-necked one), eager for battle—went forth against the cities of kings.
'2': >-
  Approaching those royal lords, who were like Indra and Varuṇa in majesty, the
  rākṣasa-king spoke: “Let battle be granted to me.”
'3': >-
  “Or else say, ‘We are conquered’—this indeed is my fixed resolve. For those
  who act otherwise in this matter shall find no release.”
'4': >-
  Then, those fearless and wise monarchs, steadfast in dharma, consulted with
  one another; and those kings of very great might, understanding the superior
  boon-born power of the foe, declared: “We are conquered.”
'5': >-
  Duṣyanta, Suratha, Gādhi, King Gaya, and Purūravas—these rulers all said,
  “Dear one, we are conquered.”
'6': Then Rāvaṇa, the lord of rākṣasas, reached Ayodhyā.
'7': >-
  Ayodhyā was well-guarded by Anaraṇya, as Amarāvatī is guarded by Śakra
  (Indra). He (Anaraṇya) was a tiger among men, equal to the slayer of cities
  (Indra) in might.
'8': >-
  Drawing near that king, Rāvaṇa said: “Grant me battle. Or say, ‘I am
  conquered’—such is my command to you.”
'9': >-
  The ruler of Ayodhyā, hearing the words of that wicked-souled one, Anaraṇya,
  inflamed with anger, replied to the rākṣasa-king.
'10': >-
  “I grant you single combat, O lord of rākṣasas. Stand firm; quickly make
  ready—so shall you be, and so shall I be as well.”
'11': >-
  Then, the great army of that king—renowned already for its prowess—marched
  out, intent on the destruction of the rākṣasas.
'12': >-
  Ten thousand elephants, a niyuta (ten thousand) of horses, many thousands of
  chariots, and foot-soldiers as well, O best of men,
'13': >-
  covered the earth as it advanced—infantry and chariots together—in the battle.
  Then a very great combat began, O expert in war.
'14': >-
  Wondrous was the battle between King Anaraṇya and the lord of rākṣasas. When
  the might of the king met the might of Rāvaṇa,
'15': >-
  all of it perished then, like an oblation consumed in fire. And after fighting
  for a long time, displaying excellent valor,
'16': >-
  that (army), blazing as it was, was quickly reduced to but a remnant. It
  entered into that press (of the foe) like moths into flame; the host there was
  destroyed, like an offering poured into fire.
'17': >-
  The king beheld that great force being destroyed, as a vast ocean is swollen
  when a hundred forest-rivers flow into it.
'18': >-
  Then, himself twanging a bow that shone like Indra’s rainbow, the king rushed
  upon Rāvaṇa, overcome with wrath.
'19': >-
  By Anaraṇya, your ministers—Mārīca, Śuka, and Sāraṇa—together with Prahasta,
  were shattered and fled like deer.
'20': >-
  Then the delight of the Ikṣvāku line caused eight hundred arrows to fall upon
  the head of that rākṣasa-king.
'21': >-
  Yet those arrows, though falling upon him, made no wound anywhere—like streams
  of rain falling from clouds upon a mountain peak.
'22': >-
  Then the rākṣasa-king, enraged, struck the king upon the head with his palm;
  and the monarch fell down from his chariot.
'23': >-
  That king, fallen on the ground, his limbs distressed and trembling, lay like
  a śāla tree in the forest felled as though by a thunderbolt’s scorching blow.
'24': >-
  Mocking him, the rākṣasa said to that Ikṣvāku lord of the earth: “What fruit
  have you gained now, by waging war against me?”
'25': >-
  “In the three worlds there is none, O king, who would grant me single combat.
  I suspect that, attached to enjoyments, you do not heed my power.”
'26': >-
  While he thus spoke, the king, his life-force faint, answered him with these
  words: “What indeed can be done here? Time is hard to overstep.
'27': >-
  “For I am not conquered by you, O rākṣasa, you who praise yourself. I have
  been brought low by Time alone; yet you have become the instrumental cause of
  it.
'28': >-
  “But what can I now do, when my life is at its end? For I am not one who turns
  away—fighting with you I am slain, O rākṣasa.”
'29': >-
  “Yet, because you have insulted an Ikṣvāku, I shall speak words to you, O
  rākṣasa. If what I have given, if what I have offered, if my well-earned merit
  and austerity, if my subjects have been rightly protected by me—then let my
  word be true.”
'30': >-
  “There shall arise in this very lineage of the great-souled Ikṣvākus one named
  Rāma, son of Daśaratha, who shall take away your life.”
'31': >-
  Then, as that curse was uttered, there arose a mighty cloud-like roar, as
  though the drums of the gods had been struck; and a rain of flowers fell from
  the sky.
'32': >-
  Thereafter that king, O king among kings, went to the station of Triviṣṭapa
  (heaven). And when that monarch had gone to heaven, that rākṣasa withdrew.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of the Uttara Kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Curse of Anaraṇya.”
