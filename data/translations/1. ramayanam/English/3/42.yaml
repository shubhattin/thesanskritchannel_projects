  Now begins the Forty-second Sarga of the Araṇyakāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Beholding of the Golden Deer.”
'1': >-
  Having thus spoken those harsh words, Mārīca then said to Rāvaṇa—wretched and
  fearful of the lord of the night-rangers—“Let us go.”
'2': >-
  “And I have been seen again by him—by the wielder of arrow, bow, and sword—who
  stood ready with uplifted weapon to slay me; and my life was as good as struck
  down.”
'3': >-
  “For none, having assailed Rāma in battle, returns alive. He stands before you
  as the very image of the noose of Death, like one smitten by Yama’s rod.”
'4': >-
  “What indeed can I do in such a matter, with you who are of evil soul?
  Therefore I depart, dear one; may well-being be yours, O rākṣasa.”
'5': >-
  At those words the rākṣasa became delighted; and embracing Mārīca closely, he
  spoke this speech:
'6': >-
  “This boldness of yours is fitting, you who act according to my will. Now you
  are truly Mārīca; before this, you were as it were another rākṣasa.”
'7': >-
  “Mount quickly upon this bird-like chariot, adorned with jewels. My car is
  yoked, with me, with asses that have the faces of piśācas.”
'8': >-
  “Having enticed Vaidehī, you may go wherever you please; and I shall seize
  Sītā the Maithilī by force and carry her away when she is left alone.”
'9': >-
  Then Tāṭakā’s son said to him, to Rāvaṇa, “So be it.” Thereupon Rāvaṇa and
  Mārīca approached that chariot, like unto a vimāna.
'10': >-
  Mounting it, they went swiftly from that hermitage precinct, looking as they
  went upon towns and forests as before.
'11': >-
  And they beheld mountains, all the rivers, the realms and the cities; and,
  reaching the Daṇḍaka forest, they came then to Rāghava’s hermitage.
'12': >-
  There Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, together with Mārīca, saw it; and
  alighting from that chariot adorned with golden ornaments,
'13': >-
  Rāvaṇa, taking Mārīca by the hand, spoke these words: “This is the site of
  Rāma’s hermitage, seen here, surrounded by banana plants.”
'14': >-
  “Let that be done quickly, my friend, for the sake of which we have come.”
  Hearing Rāvaṇa’s words, Mārīca the rākṣasa then
'15': >-
  became a deer and began to wander at the doorway of Rāma’s hermitage. Assuming
  a form of great wonder to behold,
'16': >-
  he had antler-tips like choice gems; a face of white and dark hues; a
  countenance like red lotus and water-lily; and ears like blue lotuses.
'17': >-
  His neck was somewhat raised; his belly like sapphire; his flanks like the
  madhūka flower; and his body like the filaments of a lotus.
'18': >-
  His hooves shone like vaidūrya (cat’s-eye gem); his legs were slender and
  well-knit; and with a tail, radiant upward, of the hue of Indra’s bow,
'19': >-
  he was pleasing, of glossy and enchanting color, surrounded with many kinds of
  jewels. In a moment the rākṣasa became a supremely splendid deer.
'20': >-
  Fashioning that captivating, lovely, and sight-delighting form, that rākṣasa
  moved about, as though setting that fair forest and the site of Rāma’s
  hermitage ablaze.
'21': >-
  For the sake of enticing Vaidehī, he wandered—variegated with many ores—moving
  properly along the grassy patches on every side.
'22': >-
  Made wondrous with hundreds of silvery spots, and lovely to behold, he roamed
  about, feeding on the tender shoots of the trees.
'23': >-
  Going to the cluster of banana-groves, then here and there among the karnikāra
  trees, he moved with gentle pace, seeking that meeting with Sītā’s sight.
'24': >-
  That great deer, with a back beautifully marked like a lotus, shone
  exceedingly, and wandered at ease near the site of Rāma’s hermitage.
'25': >-
  Again going forth and again returning, that best of deer roamed about; having
  gone for a short while in haste, it returned once more.
'26': >-
  Sporting at times upon the ground, it would sit down again; coming near the
  hermitage door, it would go along with herds of deer.
'27': >-
  Followed by herds of deer, it would return again, that rākṣasa who had become
  a deer—desiring the sight of Sītā.
'28': >-
  Leaping out, it wheeled about, making various lovely circles; and seeing it,
  all the other deer that ranged in the forest
'29': >-
  came near, sniffed it, and then fled in the ten directions. Yet that rākṣasa
  too, intent on the killing of wild deer,
'30': >-
  did not eat them though he touched them—so as to conceal his true nature. At
  that very time, Vaidehī, the auspicious-eyed,
'31': >-
  busy in gathering flowers, was moving among the trees—karnikāras, aśokas, and
  mangoes—she of wine-dark eyes.
'32': >-
  Plucking flowers, the fair-faced lady wandered about. Though unfit for
  dwelling in the forest, that supremely noble woman beheld that jewel-like
  deer,
'33': >-
  its body adorned with patterns of pearls and gems. And looking upon it—with
  beautiful teeth and lips, with hair upon its body like silvery ore—
'34': >-
  with eyes widened in astonishment she gazed upon it with affection. And that
  deer, wrought of illusion, beholding her—Rāma’s beloved—
'35': >-
  wandered there, as though illuminating that forest. Seeing that deer made of
  many kinds of jewels, never before seen, Sītā, Janaka’s daughter, was seized
  with the utmost wonder.
'36': >-
  Thus ends the Forty-second Sarga of the Araṇyakāṇḍa in the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Beholding of the Golden Deer.”
