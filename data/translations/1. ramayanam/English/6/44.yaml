  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-fourth canto, called “The Battle by Night.”
'1': >-
  While those Vānaras and Rākṣasas were indeed fighting on, the sun went down
  and night set in—night that was deadly, taking away life.
'2': >-
  Thus, between those dreadful foes bound in mutual enmity, each intent on
  victory, there commenced the night-battle of the Vānaras and the Rākṣasas.
'3': >-
  The Vānaras cried, “You are a Rākṣasa!” and the Rākṣasas cried, “You are a
  Vānara!”—and in that terrible darkness they struck one another down in battle.
'4': >-
  “Strike! Tear him!” “Come here!” and “How do you flee?”—such was the
  exceedingly tumultuous clamour that was heard throughout that army.
'5': >-
  In that darkness, the Rākṣasas—clad in golden armour—were seen like
  mountain-lords, like hills with forests of blazing herbs.
'6': >-
  In that darkness, hard to cross, the Rākṣasas, overcome by fury, rushed about
  at great speed, devouring the Plavaṅgamas (the monkey-warriors).
'7': >-
  Leaping upon the horses with golden head-ornaments and upon standards like
  venomous serpents, those of dreadful wrath tore them apart with their sharp
  teeth.
'8': >-
  The mighty Vānaras in battle shook the Rākṣasa host, assailing elephants,
  elephant-riders, and chariots bearing flags and standards.
'9': >-
  In a frenzy of rage they dragged and bit with their teeth; and Lakṣmaṇa and
  Rāma as well smote with arrows like poisonous serpents.
'10': >-
  They slew the foremost Rākṣasas—seen and unseen. The dust, churned up by
  horses’ hooves and raised by chariot-wheels,
'11': >-
  rose and clogged the ears and eyes of those fighting—earth-dust that checked
  their sight and hearing. And as that dreadful, hair-raising battle raged on,
  torrents of blood flowed there like very terrible rivers.
'12': >-
  Then there arose the sound of kettledrums and mṛdaṅgas and paṇavas, mingled
  with the noise of conches and the rumbling of chariot-wheels—marvellous in its
  likeness.
'13': >-
  There was a fearful din—the cries of wounded and slain Rākṣasas and the clash
  of the Vānaras’ weapons.
'14': >-
  With the chiefs of the Vānaras struck down by spears, tridents, and axes, and
  with mountain-like Rākṣasas—shape-shifting at will—also slain,
'15': >-
  that battlefield became like an offering of flowers made of weapons; it was
  hard to discern, hard to traverse, a mire of blood and streaming gore.
'16': >-
  That night became dreadful, a slayer of Vānara and Rākṣasa alike—like
  Kālārātri to all beings, impossible for any to pass beyond.
'17': >-
  Then, in that terrible darkness, those Rākṣasas, delighted, rushed straight at
  Rāma with showers of arrows.
'18': >-
  The sound of them as they charged—wrathful and roaring—became a din like the
  upheaval of the seven oceans.
'19': >-
  Rāma struck down six night-rangers with six arrows, in but the space of a
  single blink, with shafts like tongues of fire.
'20': >-
  Yajñaśatru, the unassailable, and Mahāpārśva and Mahodara; Vajradaṃṣṭra of
  vast body; and those two also—Śuka and Sāraṇa—
'21': >-
  —all of them, smitten by Rāma with torrents of arrows in every vital spot,
  withdrew from the battle, left with only the remnant of their lives.
'22': >-
  In but the space of a blink, with dreadful shafts like flames of fire, that
  great chariot-warrior made the directions and the intermediate quarters clear
  and bright.
'23': >-
  And whatever other heroic Rākṣasas stood facing Rāma—even they perished on
  coming near him, like moths entering a fire.
'24': >-
  With flying arrows all about, tipped with golden feathers, the night became
  variegated—like an autumn night filled with fireflies.
'25': >-
  And with the shouts of the Rākṣasas and the blare of the war-drums, that
  dreadful night became yet more dreadful still.
'26': >-
  By that mighty and ever-increasing uproar spreading on every side,
  Trikūṭa—filled with caves—seemed as though it cried out, like a mountain.
'27': >-
  The long-tailed, huge-bodied Vānaras, their lustre matching the darkness,
  clasped the night-rangers in their arms and devoured them.
'28': >-
  But Aṅgada, coming forth in battle to slay the foes, swiftly struck down
  Rāvaṇa’s son, and the charioteer, and the horses as well.
'29': >-
  Indrajit—his chariot abandoned, his horses slain, his charioteer killed—though
  of mighty frame, vanished there itself, by Aṅgada’s doing.
'30': >-
  That deed of Vāli’s son did all the Devas with the Ṛṣis praise; and Rāma and
  Lakṣmaṇa too—both worthy of worship—approved and honoured it.
'31': >-
  All beings knew the prowess of Indrajit in battle. Then, seeing that
  great-souled one (Aṅgada) exultant and triumphant, they were pleased and
  emboldened.
'32': >-
  Then the monkeys, with Sugrīva and Vibhīṣaṇa, overjoyed, cried out “Well done!
  Well done!” seeing the enemy defeated.
'33': >-
  But Indrajit, thus conquered by him of terrible deeds—the son of Vāli—grew
  exceedingly fierce in wrath in the fight.
'34': >-
  That sinful Rāvaṇi, wearied by battle, having gone into concealment—he, the
  heroic Indrajit, whose boon was granted by Brahmā—was overcome by rage.
'35': >-
  Invisible, with sharp arrows of thunder-like splendour, he discharged dreadful
  serpent-like shafts at Rāma and at Lakṣmaṇa as well.
'36': >-
  That Rākṣasa, enraged, pierced them in battle in all their limbs, and there,
  shrouded by his illusion, he deluded the two Rāghavas in the fight.
'37': >-
  Invisible to all beings, that night-ranger—one who fought by guile—bound the
  brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa with a net of arrows.
'38': >-
  Those two tiger-like men, the heroes, suddenly struck by him with those
  serpent-like arrows in fury—then the Vānaras looked on.
'39': >-
  When, in his own manifest form, the Rākṣasa king’s son was not able to
  overpower them, that wicked-souled one resorted to the employment of illusion
  and bound those two princes.
'40': >-
  Thus ends the forty-fourth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the sacred,
  illustrious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Battle by Night.”
