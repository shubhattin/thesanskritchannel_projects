  Now begins the sixteenth chapter, named “Rama’s Setting Forth,” in the
  Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Having passed beyond that inner-palace gateway, crowded with people, he—knower
  of ancient propriety—then reached a secluded inner corridor.
'2': >-
  It was guarded by youthful men bearing spears and bows, wearing polished
  earrings—vigilant, intent, and devoted to their own lord.
'3': >-
  There he saw, stationed at the door, elderly attendants clad in ochre
  garments, holding staffs in their hands, well-adorned—women’s superintendents,
  composed and attentive.
'4': >-
  Seeing him approaching, and desiring to do what was pleasing to Rama, they all
  sprang up at once from their seats in eager haste.
'5': >-
  Then Sumantro, the charioteer’s son, disciplined in spirit and respectful,
  addressed them: “Quickly inform Rama—Sumantro is standing at the door.”
'6': >-
  They approached Rama—wishing to do what was pleasing to their master—and at
  once reported swiftly to Rama together with his wife.
'7': >-
  Knowing that the charioteer had been announced, Rāghava—eager to oblige—had
  him brought there itself into his father’s inner apartments.
'8': >-
  The charioteer saw him seated upon a golden couch with a coverlet,
  well-adorned, resembling Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera) in splendour.
'9': >-
  That subduer of foes was anointed with precious sandal-paste—pure, fragrant,
  and of the hue of boar’s blood.
'10': >-
  He was attended also by Sītā at his side, holding a yak-tail fan in her
  hand—like the moon accompanied by a brilliant constellation.
'11': >-
  Beholding him, like the blazing sun, endowed with his own radiance,
  Sumantro—the herald of auspicious tidings—bowed to that bestower of boons,
  with modesty, in a properly humble manner.
'12': >-
  With joined palms, looking upon the fair-faced prince as he sat in his
  leisure, repose, and seat, Sumantro—honoured by the king—spoke these words:
'13': >-
  “Rama, noble son of Kausalyā, your father wishes to see you; and Queen Kaikeyī
  also. Go there—do not delay.”
'14': >-
  Thus addressed, that lion among men, of great splendour, rejoiced; then he
  honoured Sītā and spoke this to her:
'15': >-
  “O Goddess, it is certain that the god-like king and the queen, having met in
  private, are consulting about something connected with my consecration.”
'16': >-
  “Perceiving the intention, that dark-eyed queen—desirous of what is dear to me
  and skilled in winning favour—is urging the king on my behalf.”
'17': >-
  “She is delighted, and follows what is beneficial for the great king; and my
  mother too, intent on my welfare—she is the daughter of the lord of the
  Kekayas.”
'18': >-
  “Fortune indeed favours it, that the great king, together with his beloved
  queen, has sent Sumantro as a messenger to fulfil my purpose and desire.”
'19': >-
  “Such as the assembly there is, such is the messenger who has come; surely
  today itself the king will consecrate me in the office of heir-apparent.”
'20': >-
  “Come then—I shall go quickly from here and behold the lord of the earth. You,
  with your attendants, remain comfortably seated and take your pleasure.”
'21': >-
  Thus honoured by her husband, Sītā, dark-eyed, followed him up to the doorway,
  uttering auspicious blessings.
'22': >-
  “May the king perform for you a consecration to sovereignty—attended by the
  twice-born—like the creation-sustaining Indra himself.”
'23': >-
  “As I behold you—initiated, endowed with sacred observances, pure, wearing the
  royal insignia, and holding a deer’s horn in your hand—I seek refuge in you.”
'24': >-
  “May the wielder of the thunderbolt protect your eastern quarter; may Yama
  protect your southern; may Varuṇa guard the western direction; and may the
  lord of wealth guard your northern quarter.”
'25': >-
  Then, taking leave of Sītā, and having undertaken auspicious rites and joyful
  observances, Rama went out from his residence together with Sumantro.
'26': >-
  Emerging like a lion from a mountain-cave, he saw Lakṣmaṇa standing at the
  door with bowed head and palms joined in reverence.
'27': >-
  Then, in the middle courtyard, he met with his well-wishers; seeing all those
  petitioners, he approached them and greeted them courteously.
'28': >-
  Thereupon that tiger among men—the prince, the king’s son—mounted an excellent
  chariot, gleaming like fire, richly decked with tiger-skins.
'29': >-
  It rumbled like thunder, was unobstructed in movement, adorned with jewels and
  gold, stealing, as it were, the eyes by its radiance—splendid as Mount Meru.
'30': >-
  Yoked with supreme horses, like young calves of elephants in strength, swift
  as the chariot of thousand-eyed Indra—drawn by bay steeds—it sped along.
'31': >-
  Rāghava set forth swiftly, mounting it, blazing with regal fortune; and on the
  sky-like roadway it resounded with its noise like a rain-cloud.
'32': >-
  That illustrious one came forth from his abode like the moon emerging from a
  great cloud; and Lakṣmaṇa, the younger brother of Rāghava, held a variegated
  yak-tail fan in his hand.
'33': >-
  Mounting a chariot behind, the brother guarded his brother; then a tumultuous
  clamour of “hāhā” and “hēhē” arose.
'34': >-
  As he was coming forth, a flood of people gathered all around him; and then
  foremost excellent horses and elephants like mountains appeared (in the
  throng).
'35': >-
  Thus hundreds and thousands followed after Rama; and in front of him went
  armoured men, adorned with sandal and aguru perfumes.
'36': >-
  Bearing swords and bows, heroic men advanced, full of eager hope; then arose
  the sounds of instruments, and the sounds of praises sung by bards.
'37': >-
  And the lion-roars of warriors were heard along the road; from every side,
  women adorned and standing at the windows of mansions looked on.
'38': >-
  And the subduer of foes proceeded, showered with heaps of beautiful flowers by
  the women—faultless in every limb—who wished to delight Rama.
'39': >-
  Those on terraces and those on the ground paid homage with excellent words:
  “Surely your mother Kausalyā rejoices today, O delight of mothers,”
'40': >-
  “For she beholds you setting forth in auspicious success, with your ancestral
  kingdom now come into your hands; and among all noble ladies, she beholds
  Sītā—the best of noble ladies.”
'41': >-
  For those women deemed Sītā to be Rama’s heart’s beloved; “Surely in former
  times the देवी (Sītā) performed great austerities, of excellent conduct,”
'42': >-
  “Since she who has attained union with Rama is like Rohiṇī with the moon.”
  Such dear words spoken by the women upon the palace-rooftops, the best of men
  heard as he travelled along the royal highway.
'43': >-
  Thus Rāghava then heard the talk of the gathered people there—varied words
  concerning their own rights and prospects—of the citizens in the city, whose
  faces were bright with joy.
'44': >-
  “Today Rāghava attains great fortune, going to abundant prosperity by the
  king’s favour; and we—whose desires are all fulfilled—shall have him as our
  ruler.”
'45': >-
  “It is the people’s gain that he will obtain this entire realm for long; for
  no one will ever see anything displeasing, nor behold sorrow, under this lord
  of men.”
'46': >-
  Thus honoured—with clamorous horses, with elephants, with auspicious
  choristers and panegyrists going before, with excellent musicians, and with
  praises—he proceeded like Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera).
'47': >-
  Rama beheld the spotless great thoroughfare—crowded with elephant-cows,
  elephants, chariots, and horses; with its squares filled by vast multitudes;
  rich in gems; and stocked with abundant merchandise and many kinds of
  trade-goods.
'48': >-
  Thus ends the sixteenth chapter, named “Rama’s Setting Forth,” in the
  Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
