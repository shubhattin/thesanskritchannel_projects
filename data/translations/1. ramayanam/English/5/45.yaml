  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-fifth sarga, called “The Slaying of the Sons of the Ministers.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon, urged on by the lord of the rākṣasas, the sons of the ministers set
  forth—seven and seven—from that palace, radiant as though with sevenfold
  flames.
'2': >-
  They went surrounded by a vast host, bearing bows and endowed with great
  might—accomplished in the use of weapons, foremost among men skilled in arms,
  each seeking to surpass the others in victory.
'3': >-
  Mounted upon great chariots yoked with steeds that roared like thunderclouds,
  furnished with banners and pennants, and hemmed about with nets of gold, they
  advanced.
'4': >-
  Those of immeasurable prowess, exhilarated, twanged their bows—bows adorned
  with heated-gold workmanship—like lightning-bearing clouds spreading their
  flashes.
'5': >-
  Then their mothers, learning that the kiṅkaras had been slain, became
  bewildered with grief, along with their kinsmen and friendly companions.
'6': >-
  Then those warriors, adorned with molten-gold ornaments that clashed against
  one another, rushed upon Hanumān, who stood stationed upon the gateway-tower.
'7': >-
  Pouring forth showers of arrows, with the din of their chariots as their
  thunder, those rākṣasa-clouds ranged about like monsoon clouds.
'8': >-
  Then, covered over by those showers of shafts, Hanumān’s form became wholly
  veiled—like a king of mountains enveloped by rain.
'9': >-
  That swift-moving monkey evaded their arrows, and, coursing through the
  stainless sky, eluded also the charging speed of the heroes’ chariots.
'10': >-
  Sporting in mid-air among those bowmen, the heroic one shone forth—like the
  mighty Wind-god in the sky amid thunderclouds.
'11': >-
  Raising a dreadful roar, terrorizing that great host, the powerful Hanumān
  made a swift onslaught upon those rākṣasas.
'12': >-
  Some he struck down with his palm, some with his feet, O scorcher of foes;
  some he smote with his fists, and some he rent asunder with his nails.
'13': >-
  Some he crushed with his chest, and others again with his thighs; and some, by
  the sheer sound of his roar alone, fell there and then to the earth.
'14': >-
  Then, as they lay helpless and as many fell upon the ground, all that army,
  afflicted with fear, fled in all the ten directions.
'15': >-
  Elephants cried out discordantly, and the horses fell to the earth; and the
  ground became strewn with chariots whose poles were shattered, and whose
  banners and parasols were broken.
'16': >-
  And then, with blood streaming, the roadways were shown as if turned into
  running channels; and Laṅkā resounded terribly at that time with manifold and
  dreadful sounds.
'17': >-
  Having slain those grown and powerful rākṣasas—the monkey of great strength
  and fierce valor—still eager to fight other rākṣasas, the hero once more
  returned to that very gateway-tower.
'18': >-
  Thus ends the forty-fifth sarga in the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Slaying of the Sons of the
  Ministers.”
