  Now begins the fourteenth chapter in the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Kaikeyī’s Reproach (Upālambha).”
'1': >-
  Seeing that wicked Kaikeyī’s husband—the Ikṣvāku king—was tortured by grief
  for his son, had fallen senseless upon the earth, and was writhing in
  distress, she spoke these words to him.
'2': >-
  “Is it as though you have committed some sin that, upon hearing what I have
  said and promised, you lie thus upon the ground, sunk on the surface of the
  earth, unfit to stand firm in your position?”
'3': >-
  “Those who know dharma declare indeed that truth is the highest dharma; and
  taking refuge in truth, I have urged you toward dharma.”
'4': >-
  “Having pledged it, King Śaibya—the lord of the earth—gave his own body to a
  hawk; and by giving it to the bird, the king attained the highest state.”
'5': >-
  “So too, the brilliant Alarka, when a brāhmaṇa well-versed in the Vedas begged
  him for his own eyes, tore them out and—though sorrowing—gave them.”
'6': >-
  “And the lord of rivers, though its boundary is small, being endowed with
  truth, does not overstep its own shore at the appointed time, constrained by
  fidelity to truth.”
'7': >-
  “Truth is the one syllabled Brahman; in truth dharma is established. The Vedas
  are imperishable because of truth; and by truth the Supreme is attained.”
'8': >-
  “Therefore follow truth, if your mind is set upon dharma. Let that boon of
  mine be fulfilled—since you, O best of the virtuous, are a giver of boons.”
'9': >-
  “For the sake of dharma alone, and at my very urging, banish my son Rāma.
  Indeed, I say it to you three times.”
'10': >-
  “And if you will not carry out this agreement of mine, then, cast aside before
  your very eyes, I shall abandon my life.”
'11': >-
  Thus pressed by Kaikeyī, the king could not loosen the noose—like Bali, bound
  by Indra—though she spoke without the least hesitation.
'12': >-
  His heart was thrown into turmoil and his face became pale; he trembled like a
  beast of burden that quivers between the two wheels of a yoke-cart.
'13': >-
  And the lord of the earth, as though seeing nothing with his two failing eyes,
  with great difficulty, steadying himself by courage, spoke this to Kaikeyī:
'14': >-
  “That hand of yours—joined to mine by sacred mantras—which I, in my sin, took
  in the fire, I cast it off; and together with you I cast off your son and my
  own son.”
'15': >-
  “The night, O queen, has passed on toward the rising of the sun. The people
  will surely hasten me for the consecration.”
'16': >-
  “With the preparations for Rāma’s consecration, arranged for that very
  purpose, Rāma must perform for me—when I am dead—the water-rites (the funeral
  libations).”
'17': >-
  “But you, along with your son, must not perform those water-rites for me, if
  you obstruct Rāma’s consecration, O woman of inauspicious conduct.”
'18': >-
  “I am not able today to behold that very face which earlier I used to see—now
  robbed of delight and joy—and again to see the people with faces turned
  downward.”
'19': >-
  While that great-souled lord of the earth was speaking thus, the sacred night
  came to its end—dawn broke, adorned with the moon and the
  constellation-garlands.
'20': >-
  Then Kaikeyī, of sinful ways, again addressed the king with harsh words—she
  who knew how to speak, but was overcome by anger:
'21': >-
  “What is this speech, O king, like a pain caused by poison? You ought to bring
  here, without exertion, your son Rāma.”
'22': >-
  “Establishing my son in the kingdom, making Rāma a dweller in the forest, and
  making me free of rivals—you will then become one whose task is accomplished.”
'23': >-
  Then the king, repeatedly goaded by Kaikeyī, spoke—like a superb horse prodded
  by a sharp goad:
'24': >-
  “I am bound by the bond of dharma, and my awareness has been destroyed. I wish
  to see my eldest, beloved son Rāma, that righteous one.”
'25': >-
  When the night had ended and the sun had risen, and the auspicious conjunction
  of the constellation and the proper muhūrta had arrived,
'26': >-
  Vasiṣṭha, endowed with virtues, surrounded by his disciples, quickly taking up
  the preparations, entered the excellent city (Ayodhyā).
'27': >-
  He beheld the roads sprinkled and swept, adorned with splendid banners;
  crowded with rejoicing people and attendants; and rich with thriving markets
  and shops.
'28': >-
  It was filled with the great festival, eager for the sake of Rāghava; and on
  every side it was enveloped in fragrant smoke of sandal and aguru incense.
'29': >-
  Passing through that city, resembling the city of Purandara (Indra), the
  illustrious sage beheld the inner palace, filled with hosts of many banners.
'30': >-
  It was crowded with townsmen and countryfolk, and beautified by brāhmaṇas;
  fully furnished with staffs (of office), and highly honored with excellent
  horses.
'31': >-
  Reaching that inner palace, Vasiṣṭha—exceedingly pleased and attended by
  foremost sages—moved through the assembled people.
'32': >-
  There he saw Sumantra, the charioteer, having come out, standing at the
  doorway of the lion among men (the king), the beloved and handsome minister.
'33': >-
  To him, that mighty, sagacious son of a sūta, Vasiṣṭha, a man of great
  splendor, said: “Quickly announce that I have come here to the king.”
'34': >-
  “Here are golden pitchers of Gaṅgā-water, and others from the seas; and an
  auspicious udumbara-wood seat has been brought for the consecration.”
'35': >-
  “All manner of seeds and fragrances, and various jewels; honey, curds, ghee,
  parched grain, darbha grass, beautiful flowers, and milk.”
'36': >-
  “And eight lovely maidens; and an intoxicated, excellent elephant; a splendid
  chariot drawn by four horses; a sword and an excellent bow.”
'37': >-
  “A palanquin borne by men; a parasol resembling the moon; two white yak-tail
  fans; and a golden sprinkling-vessel.”
'38': >-
  “A pale bull with a prominent hump, adorned with golden garlands; and a tawny
  lion, four-fanged, the best of beasts, of great strength.”
'39': >-
  “A throne, a tiger-skin; fuel-sticks and the sacred fire; all the assemblages
  of musical instruments; and courtesans—women richly adorned.”
'40': >-
  “Teachers, brāhmaṇas, cows; auspicious deer and birds; and the best of
  townsmen and countryfolk, and the merchants together with their groups.”
'41': >-
  “These and many others besides—pleased and sweet-spoken—stand together with
  the king, for Rāma’s consecration.”
'42': >-
  “Make haste to the great king, so that when the day has fully arisen, at the
  conjunction with the Puṣya constellation, Rāma may obtain the kingdom.”
'43': >-
  Hearing his words, the powerful son of the sūta, praising the tiger among
  kings, entered the royal residence.
'44': >-
  Those stationed at the doorway—elders previously instructed and approved by
  the king, desiring what was pleasing to him—were not able to bar his entrance.
'45': >-
  Coming near the king, he recognized that condition of his, and began to laud
  him with words of highest gratification.
'46': >-
  Then Sumantra, as before, in the king’s residence, joining his palms in
  reverence, praised the lord of the earth.
'47': >-
  “As the radiant ocean rejoices at the rising of the sun, so do you, with a
  glad heart, gladden us now.”
'48': >-
  “At this very hour, Mātali praised Indra, and Indra conquered all the Dānavas;
  so too do I now awaken you.”
'49': >-
  “As the Vedas with their auxiliary limbs and the sciences today awaken the
  self-born Lord, Brahmā, so do I awaken you.”
'50': >-
  “As the sun together with the moon awakens this auspicious earth which bears
  all beings, so do I awaken you.”
'51': >-
  “Arise, O most great king—your auspicious rites and joyful observances are
  completed—shining in form like the sun upon Mount Meru.”
'52': >-
  “May Soma and Sūrya, O Kakutstha; and Śiva and Vaiśravaṇa as well; and Varuṇa,
  Agni, and Indra grant you victory.”
'53': >-
  “The blessed night has passed; this duty of yours stands ready. Awake, O tiger
  among kings; perform the task immediately.”
'54': >-
  “All the consecration materials for Rāma are prepared in full; and the
  townsmen and countryfolk, and the merchants too, stand with joined palms.”
'55': >-
  “The venerable Bhagavān Vasiṣṭha himself stands with the brāhmaṇas. Quickly, O
  king, command Rāghava’s consecration.”
'56': >-
  “For as cattle are helpless without a herdsman, as an army is helpless without
  a leader, as night is without the moon, as cows are without a bull,”},{
