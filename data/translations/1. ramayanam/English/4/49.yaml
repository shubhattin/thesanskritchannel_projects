  Now begins the forty-ninth sarga (chapter), named “The Search on the Silver
  Mountain (Rajataparvata),” in the Kishkindhā-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then Angada, the great and wise one, having himself become weary, gently
  encouraged them and spoke these words to all the vānaras.
'2': >-
  “Forests, mountains, rivers, inaccessible strongholds, dense and impenetrable
  tracts, ravines, and mountain-caves too—everything has been searched all
  around, thoroughly, in every direction.
'3': >-
  “And yet, in place after place, Jānakī is not seen by us; nor is that wicked
  rākṣasa—the sinner who carried Sītā away—found.
'4': >-
  “Great time has passed for us, and Sugrīva too is a king of fierce command.
  Therefore, all of you, united together, search on every side, all around.
'5': >-
  “Casting off sloth, grief, and the sleep that has overtaken you, search in
  such a way that we may behold Sītā, the daughter of Janaka.
'6': >-
  “Freedom from despondency, skill in action, and an unconquered mind—these are
  declared to bring success in one’s undertaking. Therefore I say this to you.
'7': >-
  “Even now let the forest-dwellers search this difficult, formidable
  wilderness. Having abandoned weariness, let everyone search the forest again
  in its entirety.
'8': >-
  “Surely, for those who strive, the fruit of that effort is seen; but having
  fallen into utter discouragement, it is not fitting for us to remain
  inactive.”
'9': >-
  “Sugrīva is a wrathful king, O vānaras, and he is one of severe punishment;
  and the great-souled Rāma also is to be ever held in awe.
'10': >-
  “This has been spoken for your welfare. Let it be done, if it pleases you.
  Indeed, say what is proper and fitting for all of us, O vānaras.”
'11': >-
  Hearing Angada’s words, Gandhamādana replied in a clear voice, though
  distressed by thirst and fatigue.
'12': >-
  “Indeed, Angada, the speech you have spoken is wholly fitting—beneficial and
  favorable. Let what he has said be carried out.
'13': >-
  “Let us search again the mountains, the caverns and the rocks, the deserted
  forests, and the waterfalls and springs that issue from the hills.
'14': >-
  “Exactly as all has been directed by the great-souled Sugrīva, let all of you
  together search the entire forest and the mountain-fastnesses.”
'15': >-
  Then those mighty vānaras rose up once more and ranged through the southern
  quarter, thickly overgrown with the Vindhya forests.
'16': >-
  They—those vānaras—ascended the splendid Silver Mountain, like an autumn cloud
  in appearance, crowned with peaks and filled with ravines.
'17': >-
  There, searching, those foremost of monkeys—longing to behold Sītā—went
  through charming lodhra-groves and groves of the seven-leaved trees as well.
'18': >-
  Having climbed to its summit, those weary heroes of great prowess did not
  behold Vaidehī—Rāma’s beloved chief queen.
'19': >-
  But seeing that mountain, with its many caverns coming within their range of
  sight, the monkeys climbed upon it, scanning all around on every side.
'20': >-
  Then, descending to the ground, exhausted and dispirited, they stood there for
  a moment, taking refuge at the roots of trees.
'21': >-
  After resting for a moment and somewhat breaking their fatigue, they again set
  forth, intent on searching the entire southern region.
'22': >-
  Then the chiefs among the leaping ones, with Hanumān at their head, set
  out—taking the Vindhya first—and searched in every direction, all around.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the forty-ninth sarga, named “The Search on the Silver Mountain
  (Rajataparvata),” in the Kishkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primal epic.
