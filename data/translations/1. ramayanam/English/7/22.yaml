'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-second chapter, called “The Conquest of Yama.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that mighty roar, the lord Vaivasvata (Yama) deemed that a victorious
  enemy had appeared, and that the strength of his own forces had been
  diminished (by slaughter).
'2': >-
  For, thinking that his warriors had been slain, and his eyes reddened with
  wrath, he quickly spoke to his charioteer: “Let this chariot be brought here
  at once.”
'3': >-
  Then his charioteer brought forward the divine great chariot; and that mighty
  and resplendent one mounted it. And Death, holding a spear and a mace, stood
  before him (as his attendant).
'4': >-
  He by whom this entire imperishable triple world is gathered up (and
  withdrawn)—beside him stood the embodied Kāla-daṇḍa, the Rod of Time, the
  divine weapon of Yama, blazing with fiery splendour.
'5': >-
  On its sides were set the flawless nooses of Time (kāla-pāśas), without gap or
  defect.
'6': >-
  And there stood the manifest mace, like to the touch of fire in its burning
  heat.
'7': >-
  Then all the three worlds were thrown into agitation; the dwellers in heaven
  trembled on beholding Kāla thus enraged, the bringer of terror to all the
  worlds.
'8': >-
  Thereupon the charioteer urged on those splendid, radiant horses, and Yama,
  with a dreadful din, set out for where the lord of the rākṣasas was stationed.
'9': >-
  In but a moment those steeds, resembling tawny horses and swift as the mind,
  carried Yama to where that battle had begun.
'10': >-
  Seeing that chariot so fearsome and distorted (in dread majesty), accompanied
  by Death, the ministers of the rākṣasa-king fled in sudden haste.
'11': >-
  For, being of feeble courage, and driven by fear, they lost their senses and
  ran away in all directions, saying, “We are not able to fight here.”
'12': >-
  But Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa), seeing that chariot which struck fear into the worlds,
  was not shaken, nor did fear enter into him.
'13': >-
  Then Yama, coming up to Rāvaṇa, hurled spears and javelins with force;
  enraged, he struck and cut at Rāvaṇa’s vital parts.
'14': >-
  Rāvaṇa, however, remaining self-possessed, let loose a rain of arrows upon
  that chariot of Vaivasvata, like a cloud pouring down a shower of water.
'15': >-
  Then, as great arrows, endowed with mighty power, were made to fall upon his
  broad chest—he, that rākṣasa, tormented by the piercing shafts, could not make
  any effective counterstroke.
'16': >-
  Thus, with weapons of many kinds, Yama, the subduer of foes, for seven nights
  rendered his enemy senseless and turned away in the battle.
'17': >-
  So there arose a tumultuous war between Yama and the rākṣasa—two heroes, each
  desiring victory, and neither turning back in combat.
'18': >-
  Then the gods, with gandharvas, siddhas, and the highest seers, assembling
  with Prajāpati at their head, came together to that battlefield.
'19': >-
  At that time, as those two fought in wrath, it was as though a universal
  dissolution (saṁvarta) had come upon the worlds—between the foremost of
  rākṣasas and the lord of the departed (the ruler of the pretas).
'20': >-
  The lord of rākṣasas, drawing his bow that shone like Indra’s thunderbolt,
  then discharged arrows so as to fill the sky, as it were, without interval.
'21': >-
  With four sharp arrows he struck Death, and with seven he afflicted the
  charioteer; and with a hundred thousand he swiftly smote Yama upon his vital
  parts.
'22': >-
  Then from the mouth of enraged Yama there came forth a garlanded flame—fiery
  with his breath, smoky, a blaze born of wrath.
'23': >-
  Seeing that marvel in the presence of gods and dānavas, Death and Kāla became
  at once exultant and fiercely impassioned.
'24': >-
  Then Death, more wrathful still, spoke to Vaivasvata: “Release me in the
  battle, so that I may slay this sinful rākṣasa. This rākṣasa shall not remain
  today—such is the boundary fixed by nature!”
'25': “Hiraṇyakaśipu the illustrious, Namuci, and Śambara likewise,”
'26': “Viśandhi and Dhūmaketu, and Bali the son of Virocana as well;”
'27': >-
  “Dambhu the great king of daityas, Vṛtra, and Bāṇa likewise; royal seers
  learned in the śāstras; gandharvas together with mighty nāgas;”
'28': >-
  “ṛṣis, serpents, daityas, yakṣas, and hosts of apsarases; and at the turning
  of the age’s end the earth with its encompassing ocean—”
'29': >-
  “—all these, and many others too, mighty and hard to assail, I have seen
  brought to ruin; what then of this night-roaming one (this rākṣasa)?”
'30': >-
  “Release me, O good one, knower of dharma, until I slay him. For I have seen
  none—though mighty—who lives (once within my grasp).”
'31': >-
  “This is not my strength alone; this limit is by nature’s ordinance. I have
  seen none who, meeting Kāla, lives even for a moment.”
'32': >-
  Hearing those words, the puissant Dharmarāja (Yama) said there to Death: “You
  stand; I shall myself slay him.”
'33': >-
  Then, with eyes inflamed and red, the lord Vaivasvata, in anger, lifted with
  his hand the unfailing Rod of Time.
'34': >-
  On whose sides were established the innumerable nooses of Time; and the
  embodied mace stood there, like fire and thunder in its dread resemblance.
'35': >-
  He who by his very sight draws away the life-breaths of living beings—what
  then of one who is touched by him, or struck down by him?
'36': >-
  Then that great weapon, surrounded by flames as though burning the rākṣasa,
  when wielded by that mighty one and brought to bear, quivered and flashed.
'37': >-
  Thereupon all who were on that field ran away in fear from that place; and all
  the gods, greatly shaken, beheld Yama with the rod uplifted.
'38': >-
  But when Yama, desiring to strike Rāvaṇa with the rod, was about to smite,
  Pitāmaha (Brahmā) himself appeared before Yama and spoke these words:
'39': >-
  “O Vaivasvata, mighty-armed one, of immeasurable prowess—this night-roamer
  must not be slain by you with that very rod.”
'40': >-
  “For a boon has indeed been granted by me to him, O bull among the thirty
  gods; and you must not make false the word spoken by me.”
'41': >-
  “Whosoever—be he god or man—would make my word untrue, by him the three worlds
  would be made untrue; of this there is no doubt.”
'42': >-
  “When released in wrath, he (the Rod of Time) becomes indifferent to what is
  dear and what is not; that fierce one, bringing fear to the three worlds,
  destroys the creatures.”
'43': >-
  “This Rod of Time, of boundless splendour, is unfailing against all beings; it
  was created by me long ago, with Death placed in the forefront (as its
  attendant).”
'44': >-
  “Therefore, gentle one, it is not to be cast by you upon Rāvaṇa’s head; for
  when it falls upon him, no one lives even for a moment.”
'45': >-
  “And if, when it falls, this rākṣasa were not to die, or if Daśagrīva were to
  die—then in either case there would be falsehood (in my boon and word).”
'46': >-
  “Therefore restrain this rod, uplifted against the lord of Laṅkā; and make me
  truthful today, if you have regard for the worlds.”
'47': >-
  Thus addressed, righteous-souled Yama replied then: “This rod is withdrawn.
  For you are our sovereign source (and authority).”
'48': >-
  “What now can be done by me, standing in the midst of battle, if I am unable
  to slay this one, protected by a boon?”
'49': >-
  “Therefore I shall depart, vanishing even from the sight of this rākṣasa.”
  Having spoken thus, with chariot and horses, he disappeared there itself.
'50': >-
  But Daśagrīva, having conquered him and made his own name renowned, mounted
  Puṣpaka again and came forth once more from Yama’s abode.
'51': >-
  And Vaivasvata, together with the gods with Brahmā at their head, went to
  heaven rejoicing; and Nārada, the great sage, too (departed).
'52': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-second chapter, called “The Conquest of Yama,” in the
  Uttarakāṇḍa of the sacred, seer-composed, glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primordial epic.
