  Now begins, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the
  forty-first chapter, called “The Dispatch to the Southern Quarter.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon Sugrīva, having sent forth that great army of monkeys, dispatched to
  the south those vānaras who were renowned and well-proved.
'2': >-
  Nīla, the son of Agni, and Hanūmān the monkey, and Jāmbavān, the
  mighty-spirited son of the Grandsire (Brahmā),
'3': >-
  and Suhotra, and Śarāri, and Śaragulma likewise; and Gaja, Gavākṣa, Gavaya,
  Suṣeṇa, and Vṛṣabha as well;
'4': >-
  and Mainda, and Dvivida, and Suṣeṇa, and Gandhamādana; and Ulkāmukha and
  Anaṅga—both sons of the Fire-god (Agni);
'5': >-
  all these heroes with Aṅgada at their head—those swift and valiant ones—were
  commanded by the heroic lord of the monkey-hosts, who understood distinctions
  and proper means.
'6': >-
  And appointing Aṅgada—foremost among them, possessed of great strength—as the
  leader of those monkey-warriors, he directed them toward the southern region.
'7': >-
  And whatever tracts in that direction were exceedingly difficult of access,
  the lord of monkeys related and described to the foremost among the monkeys.
'8': >-
  “(Search) the Vindhya mountain with its thousand peaks, adorned with diverse
  trees and creepers; and (search) the lovely river Narmadā, frequented by
  mighty serpents;”
'9': >-
  “thereafter the charming Godāvarī, the great river with dark-braided streams;
  and the Varadā, most auspicious, visited by great serpents; and also Mekhalā,
  Utkala, and the cities of Daśārṇa;”
'10': >-
  “and Avanti, resounding (with bustle and fame)—behold and survey all of these;
  and also Vidarbha and Ṛṣṭika, and the delightful land of the Māhiṣakas as
  well;”
'11': >-
  “likewise the Vāṅgas, the Kaliṅgas, and the Kauśikas on every side; and having
  examined the Daṇḍaka forest with its mountains, rivers, and caves,”
'12': >-
  “and the river Godāvarī too—survey everything; and so also the Andhras and
  Puṇḍras, the Colas, the Pāṇḍyas, and the Keralas.”
'13': >-
  “The mountain Ayomukha, ornamented with minerals, must also be
  reached—splendid with its wondrous peaks and with forests in bloom with
  variegated flowers.”
'14': >-
  “The great mountain-region with groves of fine sandalwood must be searched;
  thereafter (seek) that divine river with clear waters and tranquil pools.”
'15': >-
  “There you shall behold the Kāverī, where bands of Apsarases disport
  themselves; and in front of the Malaya mountain you shall see the mighty,
  eminent sage Agastya, radiant like the sun.”
'16': >-
  “Then, having received permission from that great-souled one, serene and
  gracious,”
'17': >-
  “you shall cross the great river Tāmraparṇī, haunted by crocodiles; she is
  covered with lovely islands and adorned by diverse sandalwood-groves.”
'18': “Like a beloved young woman embracing her beloved, she enters into the ocean.”
'19': >-
  “Then, O monkeys, having gone to the Pāṇḍyas’ gateway—divine, made of gold,
  adorned with pearls and gems, fitted with doors—you shall behold it.”
'20': >-
  “Thereafter, having reached the ocean and having ascertained and resolved upon
  the purpose (of the search), (know that) there, by Agastya in former times,
  within the sea, was established that splendid mountain Mahendra, the best of
  mountains, with variegated slopes.”
'21': >-
  “Glorious, made of gold, plunged into the great ocean, and beautified by many
  blossoming trees and creepers,”
'22': >-
  “adorned by the foremost among Devarṣis and Yakṣas, and by Apsarases; and
  crowded with companies of Siddhas and Cāraṇas—altogether exceedingly
  delightful.”
'23': >-
  “Thither does Sahasrākṣa (Indra) ever repair, from mountain-festival to
  mountain-festival. On its farther shore lies an island, a hundred yojanas in
  extent;”
'24': >-
  “unapproachable by men, radiant—search that island on every side. There, by
  every effort, Sītā is especially to be sought.”
'25': >-
  “For that region is indeed the domain of the wicked Rāvaṇa, fit to be
  slain—the abode of the lord of rākṣasas, who shines with a splendor equal to
  Indra’s.”
'26': >-
  “In the midst of the southern ocean there is a rākṣasī famed by the name
  Aṅgārakā; she seizes one’s shadow and then devours (the victim).”
'27': >-
  “Thus, having made yourselves free from doubt—your doubts dispelled—seek the
  wife of the king of men, of immeasurable might (Rāma).”
'28': >-
  “Passing beyond that (island), at a distance of a hundred yojanas in the sea,
  is the mountain called Puṣpitaka, frequented by Siddhas and Cāraṇas.”
'29': >-
  “Shining like the beams of moon and sun, resting upon the ocean’s waters, it
  gleams with broad peaks as though scraping the very sky.”
'30': >-
  “One of its peaks is golden, which the Sun-god serves; and one is white with
  silver, which the Moon-god serves. The ungrateful do not behold it, nor the
  cruel, nor the unbelievers.”
'31': >-
  “Having bowed your heads to that mountain, search (that region), O monkeys.
  Passing beyond it—hard to assail—is the mountain named Sūryavān,”
'32': >-
  “to be traversed by a path difficult to cross, extending fourteen yojanas.
  Then, passing beyond that too, is the mountain named Vaidyuta.”
'33': >-
  “There are trees bestowing the fruits of every desire, lovely in every season.
  Having eaten there choice roots and fruits,”
'34': >-
  “and having drunk the honey that is relished, then proceed further, O monkeys.
  There is the mountain called Kuñjara, pleasing to the eyes and mind,”
'35': >-
  “where the dwelling of Agastya was fashioned by Viśvakarman—extending for a
  yojana and rising to a height of ten yojanas.”
'36': >-
  “A divine golden refuge, adorned with various jewels—there is the city named
  Bhogavatī, the abode of serpents.”
'37': >-
  “With broad royal highways, hard to assail, guarded on every side; guarded by
  terrible nāgas with sharp fangs and potent venom.”
'38': >-
  “There dwells Vāsuki, the dreadful king of serpents; and that city Bhogavatī
  must also be sought out by going forth (and exploring).”
'39': >-
  “And whatever regions adjacent to it are covered and enclosed—having crossed
  that land, (you come to where) the great bull among mountains has its seat:”
'40': >-
  “the splendid mountain named Ṛṣabha, made of every kind of jewel. There arise
  divine sandalwoods—Gośīrṣa, Padmaka, and Harīśyāma—also of fire-like
  radiance.”
'41': “But even upon seeing that sandalwood, it must never be touched at any time.”
'42': >-
  “The Gandharvas named Rohitas fiercely guard that forest; there dwell five
  chiefs of Gandharvas, radiant like the sun—”
'43': >-
  “Śailūṣa, the leader of the troop; Grāmaṇī; Śikṣa; Śuka; and Babhru
  likewise—forms like Sun, Moon, and Fire—dwellers there, men of holy deeds.”
'44': >-
  “At the earth’s extremity, difficult to overcome, the ‘conquerors of heaven’
  stand stationed. Beyond that, the world of the Pitṛs is not to be resorted to
  by you, for it is exceedingly dreadful.”
'45': >-
  “This is Yama’s capital, covered in oppressive darkness. Only so much, O
  heroes, foremost of monkeys, is possible for you to explore or to go; beyond
  this there is no course even for the swiftest.”
'46': >-
  “Having beheld all this, and whatever else may be seen, once you have
  ascertained the course regarding Vaidehī (Sītā), you should return.”
'47': >-
  “And he who returns within a month and comes forward saying, ‘Sītā has been
  seen,’—equal to me in fortune—shall happily enjoy pleasures.”
'48': >-
  “For none is dearer to me than he—more even than my very life; and though he
  may have offended me many times, he shall become my kinsman (most beloved).”
'49': >-
  “You are of immeasurable strength and valor, born in noble lineages and
  endowed with abundant virtues. Therefore, as you may obtain the daughter of
  the king of men (Sītā), undertake that endeavor, which is a higher
  excellence—true manly purpose.”
'50': >-
  Thus ends the forty-first chapter of the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, called “The Dispatch to the Southern Quarter.”
