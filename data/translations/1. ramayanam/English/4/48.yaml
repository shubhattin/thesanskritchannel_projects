  Now begins the Forty-eighth Sarga in Kishkindha-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, entitled “The Search in the Kandu Forest and other regions.”
'1': >-
  Then Hanuman the vanara, swiftly, together with Tara and Angada, set out to go
  to that region as Sugriva had directed.
'2': >-
  Going far away with all those foremost among the monkeys, he then began to
  search—examining the caves of the Vindhya and its dense, impenetrable
  thickets.
'3': >-
  They explored mountain-peaks, rivers, hard-to-cross strongholds, lakes, huge
  trees, varied clusters of trees, mountains, and the forest trees that stood on
  their slopes.
'4': >-
  Though searching in every direction on all sides, all those heroic vanaras did
  not behold Sita—Maithili, the daughter of Janaka.
'5': >-
  Eating roots and fruits of many kinds, those unconquerable ones, while
  continuing the search, camped here and there.
'6': >-
  That region was difficult to search—vast, full of caves and dense wilderness;
  waterless, unpeopled, desolate, deep, and terrible to look upon.
'7': >-
  Even after examining such forests, they were sorely afflicted; and that land
  too—vast and full of caves and dense thickets—remained hard to search.
'8': >-
  Leaving that region behind, all the leaders of the monkey-hosts, fearless and
  unhesitating, entered another land that was hard to assail.
'9': >-
  There the trees bore fruit in vain—flowerless and even bereft of leaves; there
  the rivers had no water, and even roots were exceedingly hard to find.
'10': >-
  There were no buffaloes there, no deer, and no elephants—nor tigers, nor
  birds, nor any other creatures that roam the forest.
'11': >-
  And there were no trees, no healing herbs, no creepers, nor even tender
  plants. Yet in that land there were lotus-ponds on firm ground, with smooth
  leaves and blossoming lotuses—
'12': >-
  delightful to behold and fragrant, yet devoid of swarming bees. (This forest
  belonged to) the noble sage named Kandu—truth-speaking and rich in ascetic
  power.
'13': >-
  A great rishi, exceedingly forbearing, and hard to overcome through his
  disciplines. In that forest he had a son, a mere boy of ten years.
'14': >-
  That boy was lost, and the great sage, enraged and brought to the brink of
  losing his life, caused that entire great forest to be cursed by that
  righteous one.
'15': >-
  Thus it became a place that offered no refuge, difficult to assail, and devoid
  of beasts and birds; and those vanaras searched the forest tracts and the
  mountain-caverns there—
'16': >-
  as well as the sources of the rivers—steadfast in mind. Yet even there those
  great-souled ones did not see Janaka’s daughter,
'17': >-
  nor Ravana the abductor—those who sought to do what was dear to Sugriva. Then,
  having entered that dreadful place covered with creepers and shrubs,
'18': >-
  they beheld an asura of terrible deeds, fearless even of the gods. Seeing that
  dreadful one standing like a mountain,
'19': >-
  all the vanaras drew back tightly together upon seeing that mountain-like foe.
  And he too—the mighty one—spoke to all those vanaras: “You are lost; stand!”
'20': >-
  Enraged, he rushed forward, raising his clenched fist as he came upon them. As
  he fell upon them suddenly, then Angada, the son of Vali,
'21': >-
  recognizing him as Ravana, struck him with the palm of his hand. Struck by
  Vali’s son, that asura vomited blood from his mouth;
'22': >-
  and he fell upon the earth, toppled like a mountain. When he lay there without
  breath, the vanaras—thinking the affliction removed and the danger conquered—
'23': >-
  searched there thoroughly, for the most part examining the entire
  mountain-cavern. When everything there had been searched, all those dwellers
  of the forest,
'24': >-
  entered yet another different and dreadful mountain-cavern. After searching
  again, exhausted, they came out and gathered together; and, in a secluded spot
  at the foot of a tree, they sat down, their hearts despondent.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the Forty-eighth Sarga in Kishkindha-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Adi-Kavya, entitled “The Search in the Kandu Forest and other
  regions.”
