  Now, in the sacred, illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, begins
  the thirty-third canto, called “The Marriage of Brahmadatta.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words of the wise Kuśanābha, the hundred maidens touched his
  feet with their heads and spoke.
'2': >-
  “O King, Vāyu, who pervades all beings as their very Self, desires to violate
  us; having taken to an inauspicious course, he pays no regard to righteousness
  (dharma).”
'3': >-
  “We are under our father’s guardianship—may welfare be yours; we do not stand
  in independence to follow our own will. Therefore, do you yourself choose a
  husband for us, if you will grant us (in marriage) according to your
  decision.”
'4': >-
  Because he would not accept their words, through that sinful obstinacy, while
  they were all speaking thus, they were grievously struck by Vāyu.
'5': >-
  Hearing the speech of those peerless hundred maidens, the supremely righteous
  king, of great splendour, replied to them.
'6': >-
  “For those who possess forbearance, O daughters, forgiveness is to be
  practised; you have accomplished a very great deed indeed—having come to one
  accord and having kept regard for my lineage (and honour).”
'7': >-
  “For women, forgiveness is truly an ornament; and likewise for men. That act
  of forbearance is difficult to perform—most especially among the gods.”
'8': >-
  “Such is the forbearance that is in you, O daughters, all of you without
  distinction: forgiveness is charity; forgiveness is truth; forgiveness itself
  is sacrifice, O dear daughters.”
'9': >-
  “Forgiveness is fame; forgiveness is dharma; in forgiveness the world is
  established.” Having thus dismissed the maidens, O Kakutstha, that king, whose
  prowess was like that of the gods, (then turned his mind to their bestowal in
  marriage).
'10': >-
  Knowing the canons of counsel, he deliberated with his ministers about giving
  them in marriage—how the proper bestowal should be made suitably, with due
  regard to place and time.
'11': >-
  At that very time, a greatly radiant sage named Cūlī—one of chastened seed (an
  ascetic of strict continence) and of auspicious conduct—entered upon
  Brahmanical austerity.
'12': >-
  As that ṛṣi was practising austerities there, a Gandharvī attended upon
  him—SOMADĀ by name, may welfare be yours—then the daughter of Ūrmilā.
'13': >-
  And she, having bowed to him, intent on service and reverent attendance, dwelt
  there for a long time in righteousness; and her preceptor became pleased with
  her.
'14': >-
  And in due course of time he said to her, O joy of the Raghus: “I am
  well-pleased with you—may good be yours. What shall I do that is pleasing to
  you?”
'15': >-
  Knowing the sage to be pleased, that Gandharvī of sweet voice, exceedingly
  delighted, skilled in speech, addressed him who was adept in speech:
'16': >-
  “O great ascetic, exalted by Brahmanical splendour and as it were become
  Brahman itself, I desire a righteous son—endowed with Brahmanical austerity.”
'17': >-
  “I am without a husband—may welfare be yours—and I am not the wife of anyone.
  Since I have come to you seeking refuge in Brahmanical discipline, you ought
  to grant me a son.”
'18': >-
  Pleased with her, that Brahma-ṛṣi bestowed upon her an unsurpassed Brahmanical
  gift: a son of Cūlin, born of his mind, famed by the name “Brahmadatta.”
'19': >-
  That king, Brahmadatta, then dwelt in the city of Kāmpilyā, endowed with
  supreme prosperity—like the lord of the gods in heaven.
'20': >-
  Then the thoroughly righteous king Kuśanābha formed the resolve, O Kakutstha,
  to give those hundred maidens to Brahmadatta.
'21': >-
  Summoning the mighty Brahmadatta, the lord of the earth gave him the hundred
  maidens, with an inner heart full of gladness.
'22': >-
  Then, in due order, O joy of the Raghus, Brahmadatta, protector of the earth,
  took the hand of each of them—like the lord of the gods taking (to himself)
  divine consorts.
'23': >-
  At the mere touch of his hand upon their hands, those who had been bent and
  distorted became free from affliction; and that hundred maidens then shone,
  endowed with supreme beauty and auspicious fortune.
'24': >-
  Seeing them released from Vāyu’s torment, Kuśanābha, lord of the earth, became
  supremely delighted and again and again obtained great joy.
'25': >-
  When the wedding was accomplished, Kuśanābha then sent away King Brahmadatta,
  the lord of the earth, together with his wives and with the company of priests
  and preceptors.
'26': >-
  Somadā also, seeing her son and observing conduct befitting her son, rejoiced,
  as was proper, in those maidens as her daughters-in-law; again and again
  touching those girls, and praising Kuśanābha, the Gandharvī delighted greatly.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-third canto of the Bāla-kāṇḍa in the revered
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Marriage of Brahmadatta.”
