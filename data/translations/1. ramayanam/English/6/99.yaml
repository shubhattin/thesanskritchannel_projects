  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninety-ninth chapter, called “The Slaying of Mahāpārśva.”
'1': >-
  But when Mahodara had been slain, the exceedingly mighty Mahāpārśva—having
  then looked towards Sugrīva—became wrathful, and his eyes grew red with rage.
'2': >-
  With his arrows he threw into turmoil the dreadful army of Aṅgada; and that
  rākṣasa struck down the heads of the foremost of the monkeys.
'3': >-
  He made them fall from their bodies as the wind makes fruits drop from their
  stalks; and with his shafts the rākṣasa also cut off the arms of some.
'4': >-
  Fiercely enraged against the monkeys, he tore away the sides of some; and
  those monkeys, tormented by Mahāpārśva’s shower of arrows, were sorely
  afflicted.
'5': >-
  All of them became disheartened and downcast, their minds sinking within them;
  when Aṅgada heard that the army, alarmed and shaken, was being harassed by the
  rākṣasa.
'6': >-
  That great-speeded one made a mighty onset, like the ocean surging upon the
  mountains; and taking up an iron club, radiant like the rays of the sun—
'7': >-
  —the foremost of the monkeys hurled it down upon Mahāpārśva in battle. By that
  blow Mahāpārśva became senseless.
'8': >-
  Together with his charioteer he fell unconscious from that chariot and dropped
  upon the ground. Then the splendid king of bears, Jāmbavān, resembling a mass
  of dark collyrium—
'9': >-
  —leapt forth, of very great heroism, from his own troop that looked like a
  cloud; and in anger he seized a vast rock, like a mountain-peak.
'10': >-
  With force he slew the horses and shattered that chariot. But after a short
  while Mahāpārśva, of great strength, regained consciousness—
'11': >-
  —and once again pierced Aṅgada with many arrows; and he struck Jāmbavān with
  three shafts in the region of the chest.
'12': >-
  He also smote the king of bears and Gavākṣa with many arrows. Seeing Gavākṣa
  and Jāmbavān afflicted by arrows—
'13': >-
  —Aṅgada, his wrath rising to a frenzy, seized a dreadful iron club; and with
  eyes inflamed in anger, Aṅgada took that iron weapon of the rākṣasa—
'14': >-
  —a club shining like the rays of the sun—though it was at a distance; and
  gripping it with both arms, he whirled it swiftly with great speed.
'15': >-
  The son of Vāli then hurled it at Mahāpārśva, seeking to slay him. Cast by
  that powerful one, the club struck the rākṣasa—
'16': >-
  —and knocked from his hand his bow with its arrows, and his head-guard as
  well. Closing in upon him at speed, Vāli’s valiant son—
'17': >-
  —in fury struck him with the palm at the root of the ear, with its earring.
  But Mahāpārśva, enraged, of mighty swiftness and great splendor—
'18': >-
  —seized with one hand a very large battle-axe—bright, spotless, oil-polished,
  firm, and made of mountain-essence (hard metal).
'19': >-
  That rākṣasa, exceedingly wrathful, brought it down upon Vāli’s son; it was
  hurled heavily upon Aṅgada’s left shoulder-blade.
'20': >-
  Aṅgada, in anger, wrenched the axe free. That hero Aṅgada—his fist like a
  thunderbolt—
'21': >-
  —tightened and drew it back in great rage, equal in prowess to his father;
  knowing the vital points, he aimed at the heart, near the rākṣasa’s breast—
'22': >-
  —and he drove his fist down, with the touch like Indra’s thunderbolt. By the
  force of that blow, in that great battle—
'23': >-
  —the rākṣasa’s heart was shattered, and he fell slain upon the earth. When he
  was struck down upon the ground, that army was thrown into confusion.
'24': >-
  And in the battle a great wrath arose in Rāvaṇa. But among the monkeys, who
  were filled with joy, there arose a mighty lion-roar—
'25': >-
  —as though by that sound they would burst open Laṅkā with its ramparts,
  turrets, and gateways; a great shout arose, like that of the gods together
  with Indra.
'26': >-
  Then the lord of rākṣasas, the foe of Indra—hearing in battle that mighty roar
  of the dwellers of the groves and of the abodes of the gods—became wrathful,
  and once more stood facing the war.
'27': >-
  Thus ends, in the venerable, glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the first of poems,
  in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the ninety-ninth chapter, called “The Slaying of
  Mahāpārśva.”
