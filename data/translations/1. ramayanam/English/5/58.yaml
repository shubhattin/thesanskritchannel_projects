  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-eighth chapter, called “The Recounting of Hanumān’s Deeds.”
'1': >-
  Then, upon the peak of that mountain Mahendra, those mighty monkeys—headed by
  Hanumān—attained the highest joy.
'2': >-
  When those great-souled vānaras had sat down, filled with gladness, Jāmbavān
  then, exulting, addressed that great monkey who was imbued with delight.
'3': >-
  Jāmbavān asked Anila’s son about the course of the undertaking: “How did you
  behold the Devī, and how does she fare there?”
'4': >-
  “And how, indeed, does the cruel-doer Daśānana behave toward her? Tell us all
  this in exact truth, O great ape.”
'5': >-
  “How was the Devī discovered, and what did she speak in reply? Having heard
  the matter, we shall again deliberate and determine what remains to be done.”
'6': >-
  “And whatever message ought to be conveyed there by us who have come—being
  mindful of it—and whatever must be safeguarded there, let that be clearly
  declared to us by you.”
'7': >-
  Thus appointed by him, with hairs bristling in exhilaration, Hanumān—bowing
  his head in reverence to Devī Sītā—made reply.
'8': >-
  “Before your very eyes, having leapt into the sky from the summit of Mahendra,
  intent and composed, I set my mind on reaching the southern shore of the
  ocean.”
'9': >-
  “And as I was going, there appeared to me, as though taking the form of a
  dreadful obstacle, a golden peak—divine and exceedingly enchanting.”
'10': >-
  “Standing so as to cover the path, I deemed that mountain to be a hindrance.
  Approaching that divine and excellent golden mountain,”
'11': >-
  “I resolved in my mind: ‘This must be cleft by me.’ When I struck that great
  mountain with my tail,”
'12': >-
  “its summit, radiant like the sun, was shattered into a thousand pieces.
  Understanding my determination, the great mountain spoke.”
'13': >-
  “Uttering sweet words, as though gladdening my heart: ‘My son!’—and ‘Know me
  also as your paternal uncle, a friend of Mātariśvan (the Wind).’”
'14': >-
  “‘I am famed as Maināka, dwelling in the great ocean. In former times, my son,
  the best of mountains were winged.’”
'15': >-
  “‘At will they roamed over the earth, oppressing all around. Hearing of the
  exploits of the mountains, Mahendra, the chastiser of Pāka (Indra),’”
'16': >-
  “‘the Blessed One, cut off their wings by the thunderbolt—by thousands. But I
  was rescued from that by your great-souled father.’”
'17': >-
  “‘Then, dear child, by Māruta I was cast into Varuṇa’s abode (the ocean). In
  aid of Rāghava, O subduer of foes, I must play my part.’”
'18': >-
  “Hearing this from that great-souled Maināka—‘Rāma, the foremost upholder of
  dharma, is equal to Mahendra in prowess’—”
'19': >-
  “and having made known my mission, my mind, high-strung with urgency, was
  steadied; and by that great-souled Maināka I was given leave.”
'20': >-
  “And that mountain, too—having assumed a human form—vanished: the great
  mountain into the ocean by the mountain-form, and by the human body into
  concealment.”
'21': >-
  “Then, taking up the utmost speed, I set forth upon the remaining way; and for
  a long time I proceeded on the path with swiftness.”
'22': >-
  “Thereafter I beheld the Devī Surasā, mother of the Nāgas, in the midst of the
  sea; and that goddess spoke these words.”
'23': >-
  “‘You are ordained as my food by the immortals, O best of monkeys. Therefore I
  shall devour you, for the gods have appointed you to me.’”
'24': >-
  “Thus addressed by Surasā, I stood with joined palms, bowing, my face grown
  pale; and I uttered these words.”
'25': >-
  “‘Śrīmān Rāma, son of Daśaratha, has entered the Daṇḍaka forest, together with
  his brother Lakṣmaṇa and with Sītā—he who scorches his enemies.’”
'26': >-
  “‘His wife Sītā has been abducted by the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa. As a messenger,
  by Rāma’s command, I go to her presence.’”
'27': >-
  “‘You ought to render aid to Rāma in this matter, O virtuous one; or else,
  having seen Maithilī and then Rāma, who acts without weariness,’”
'28': >-
  “‘I shall return to your mouth—this truth I pledge to you.’ Thus spoken by me,
  that Surasā, who can assume any form,”
'29': >-
  “declared: ‘Let no one pass beyond this boon of mine.’ Thus told by Surasā, I
  became in an instant ten yojanas in length.”
'30': >-
  “Then, in a moment, I became half again as broad; and she opened her mouth,
  exceeding my measure.”
'31': >-
  “Seeing her mouth thus opened, I again made myself tiny; and in that very
  moment I became the size of a thumb.”
'32': >-
  “Leaping swiftly into that mouth, I came out at once in the next instant. Then
  Devī Surasā spoke to me again, in her own form.”
'33': >-
  “‘With your purpose accomplished, O best of monkeys, go, gentle one, at your
  ease; and bring Vaidehī back to the great-souled Rāghava.’”
'34': >-
  “‘Be happy, mighty-armed one; I am pleased with you, O monkey.’ Thereupon
  I—praised by all beings—was acclaimed as ‘well done, well done!’”
'35': >-
  “Then I traversed the vast mid-air, leaping like Garuḍa. And my shadow was
  seized, yet I saw nothing at all.”
'36': >-
  “I, having lost my momentum, gazed upon the ten directions, and saw nothing
  there by which my course had been obstructed.”
'37': >-
  “Then this thought arose in me: ‘What is this in my going? Such an obstacle
  has arisen, yet no form is seen here.’”
'38': >-
  “Then my gaze, in anxious grief, fell downward; and there I saw a terrible
  rākṣasī lying in the waters.”
'39': >-
  “Laughing, she raised a great roar; and that dreadful one spoke to me—who
  stood steady and unshaken—these unseemly words.”
'40': >-
  “‘Where are you going, O huge-bodied one—desired by me who am hungry? Be my
  food; satisfy my body, long deprived of sustenance.’”
'41': >-
  “Saying ‘So be it,’ I accepted her words; and I expanded my body beyond the
  measure of her mouth.”
'42': >-
  “And her great, dreadful mouth kept widening to swallow me; yet she did not
  comprehend me, nor the stratagem I had devised.”
'43': >-
  “Then, compressing my vast form in the space of a wink, I tore out her heart
  and sprang into the expanse of the sky.”
'44': >-
  “That dreadful one, her arms flung out, fell into the salt waters—she who was
  like a mountain, her heart cut out by me.”
'45': >-
  “And I heard the pleasant voices of great-souled beings moving in the sky:
  ‘The dreadful rākṣasī Siṃhikā has been swiftly slain by Hanumān!’”
'46': >-
  “Having slain her, I again, remembering the urgent task to be fulfilled, went
  a great distance and saw a mountain-adorned region.”
'47': >-
  “On the southern shore of the ocean lies the city Laṅkā. When the sun had set,
  I beheld that city, the abode and stronghold of the rākṣasas.”
'48': >-
  “I entered, unrecognized by the rākṣasas of dreadful prowess; and as I entered
  there arose before me a certain woman, dark as a cloud at the end of an age.”
'49': >-
  “With a loud peal of laughter she sprang up in front of me—her hair like
  blazing fire—intent on killing me.”
'50': >-
  “With a blow of my left fist I overcame that exceedingly fearsome one; and at
  twilight I entered, having struck her and made her afraid.”
'51': >-
  “‘O hero, I—the city of Laṅkā—have been conquered by your valor. Therefore you
  shall conquer, without remainder, all the rākṣasas.’”
'52': >-
  “There I wandered the whole night seeking Janaka’s daughter, entering Rāvaṇa’s
  inner apartments; yet I did not see that slender-waisted lady.”
'53': >-
  “Then, not finding Sītā in Rāvaṇa’s residence, I fell into an ocean of sorrow
  and could not discern any shore.”
'54': >-
  “While grieving, I saw a most excellent grove-like enclosure of houses,
  surrounded by a rampart drawn out in gold.”
'55': >-
  “Leaping over that wall, I beheld a place filled with many trees; and in the
  midst of the Aśoka grove stood a great śiṃśapā tree.”
'56': >-
  “Climbing it, I saw a golden banana-grove; and not far from that śiṃśapā tree
  I beheld a lady of exquisite complexion.”
'57': >-
  “Dark-hued, lotus-petal-eyed, her face emaciated by fasting; clothed in a
  single garment, her hair sullied with dust,”
'58': >-
  “her limbs weakened by sorrow and torment—Sītā, steadfast for her lord’s
  good—surrounded by hideous, cruel rākṣasīs.”
'59': >-
  “Like a doe amid tigresses, those eaters of flesh and drinkers of blood;
  within their midst she was threatened by me and again and again.”
'60': >-
  “Wearing a single braid, wretched, wholly absorbed in thoughts of her husband;
  lying upon the earth, her color drained—like a lotus-pond in the winter
  season.”
'61': >-
  “Having rejected all entreaties of Rāvaṇa, resolved to die—she, the fawn-eyed
  one—was, by some means, reached by me swiftly.”
'62': >-
  “Seeing that illustrious lady—Rāma’s wife—in such a state, I remained there
  itself, watching from the śiṃśapā tree.”
'63': >-
  “Then I heard in Rāvaṇa’s dwelling a sound of ‘hala-hala,’ mingled with the
  jingling of girdles and anklets—deep and heavy.”
'64': >-
  “Then I, exceedingly distressed, drew back into my true form; and I stayed in
  the thick foliage of the śiṃśapā tree like a bird.”
'65': >-
  “Then Rāvaṇa’s wives, and Rāvaṇa himself of great might, came to that place
  where Sītā was staying.”
'66': >-
  “Seeing that lord of the rākṣasa-hosts, the noble-hipped Sītā drew in her
  thighs, and clasping her full breasts with her arms,”
'67': >-
  “trembling, terribly frightened, looking this way and that, seeing no
  protector anywhere—she, the ascetic lady, shook in fear.”
'68': >-
  “Daśagrīva spoke to Sītā, plunged in supreme sorrow: ‘Fallen with head bowed
  down, hold me in high regard.’”
'69': >-
  “‘If, proud and haughty, you do not welcome me out of arrogance, then after
  two months, O Sītā, I shall drink your blood.’”
'70': >-
  “Hearing those words of the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, Sītā, exceedingly enraged,
  spoke an excellent reply.”
'71': >-
  “‘O basest of rākṣasas! I am the wife of Rāma of immeasurable splendor—the
  lord of the Ikṣvāku line, and the daughter-in-law of Daśaratha.’”
'72': >-
  “‘How has your tongue not fallen out, speaking what should not be spoken? What
  is this valor of yours, O ignoble one, that you came having abducted me in my
  husband’s absence,’”
'73': >-
  “‘you sinful wretch—therefore unseen by that great-souled one? You are not
  equal to Rāma; you are not fit even to be his slave.’”
'74': >-
  “Rāghava is unconquerable, true to his word, heroic, and famed in battle. Thus
  spoken to harshly by Jānakī, Daśānana”
'75': >-
  “blazed suddenly with wrath, like fire upon a funeral pyre. Opening his cruel
  eyes, he raised his right fist.”
'76': >-
  “He began to strike Maithilī; then the women cried ‘Alas!’ Thereupon,
  springing up from the midst of the women, his wife—the wicked-souled one’s
  consort—”
'77': >-
  “the excellent lady named Mandodarī, restrained him. And she spoke sweet words
  to him, as he was tormented by desire.”
'78': >-
  “‘What need have you of Sītā, O you whose valor matches Indra’s? Take your
  pleasure with me today; Jānakī is not superior to me.’”
'79': >-
  “‘Along with the daughters of devas and gandharvas, and with the daughters of
  yakṣas too—sport with them, O lord. What will you do with Sītā?’”
'80': >-
  “Then, surrounded by those women, that mighty night-ranger was lifted up and
  quickly led away to his own palace.”
'81': >-
  “When that Daśagrīva had gone, the rākṣasīs with hideous faces began to revile
  Sītā with fierce and most cruel words.”
'82': >-
  “Jānakī regarded their speech as mere straw; and their roaring too, having
  reached Sītā, became fruitless.”
'83': >-
  “Those flesh-eating rākṣasīs, futile in their roaring and powerless, reported
  to Rāvaṇa Sītā’s great steadfast resolve.”
'84': >-
  “Then all of them together, hopeless and without endeavor, exhausted and worn,
  fell under the sway of sleep.”
'85': >-
  “And when they had fallen asleep, Sītā—devoted to her husband’s welfare—wailed
  pitiably, desolate, and grieved in deep sorrow.”
'86': >-
  “Rising from among them, Trijaṭā spoke these words: ‘Devour yourselves
  quickly, not Sītā of dark eyes!’”
'87': >-
  “‘She is Janaka’s daughter, a chaste and virtuous lady, and Daśaratha’s
  daughter-in-law. For today I have seen a dream—terrible and hair-raising.’”
'88': >-
  “‘It is for the destruction of the rākṣasas and for the victory of her lord.
  Enough—Rāghava is able to rescue this rākṣasa-host from peril.’”
'89': >-
  “‘Let us entreat Vaidehī—this pleases me. For if such a dream is seen by one
  afflicted with sorrow,’”
'90': >-
  “‘she is freed from diverse griefs and attains unsurpassed happiness. Indeed,
  Maithilī, Janaka’s daughter, becomes gracious when bowed to.’”
'91': >-
  “‘She is able to save you, rākṣasīs, from a great fear.’ Then that modest
  young lady, rejoicing in her husband’s victory,”
'92': >-
  “said: ‘If that be true, I shall indeed become your refuge.’ Seeing Sītā in
  such a dreadful condition,”
'93': >-
  “I rested and pondered; yet my mind found no peace. And I devised a means for
  speaking with Jānakī.”
'94': >-
  “The lineage of the Ikṣvāku clan I praised, setting it forth before her; and
  hearing those words, adorned with the speech of royal seers,”
'95': >-
  “the Devī replied to me, her eyes veiled with tears: ‘Who are you? By whom,
  and how, have you come here, O bull among monkeys?’”
'96': >-
  “‘And what affection have you for Rāma? You must tell me that.’ Hearing her
  words, I too spoke.”
'97': >-
  “‘O Devī, there is a mighty ally of your lord Rāma, of terrible prowess: the
  valiant and powerful monkey-king named Sugrīva.’”
'98': >-
  “‘Know me to be his servant, Hanumān, who has come here—sent to you by your
  husband Rāma, whose deeds know no fatigue.’”
'99': >-
  “‘And this signet-ring of recognition was given to you by that tiger among
  men, Śrīmān Daśarathi himself, O illustrious lady.’”
'100': >-
  “‘Now, O Devī, I desire to be commanded by you: what shall I do? Shall I take
  you to the side of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—what is your answer?’”
'101': >-
  “Hearing and understanding this, Sītā, daughter of Janaka, said: ‘Let Rāghava
  uproot Rāvaṇa and take me away.’”
'102': >-
  “Bowing my head to that blameless noble lady, the Devī, I asked for a token
  that would gladden Rāghava’s heart.”
'103': >-
  “Then Sītā said to me: ‘Let this excellent jewel be taken—the one by which
  mighty-armed Rāma holds you in great esteem.’”
'104': >-
  “Thus speaking, the noble-hipped lady, supremely distressed, gave me that most
  excellent, precious jewel, and instructed me with her words.”
'105': >-
  “Then, having bowed to that princess, composed, and my spirit uplifted, I
  circumambulated her reverently.”
'106': >-
  “Then she again, having resolved upon a message in her mind, said: ‘Hanumān,
  you ought to relate my tidings to Rāghava.’”
'107': >-
  “‘So arrange that, on merely hearing it, those two heroes—Rāma and
  Lakṣmaṇa—together with Sugrīva, may come quickly.’”
'108': >-
  “‘If it should be otherwise than this, my life will last but two months. The
  Kākutstha will not see me; I shall die like one without a protector.’”
'109': >-
  “Hearing those piteous words, wrath came upon me; and I perceived at once what
  remained of the task as the proper reply.”
'110': >-
  “Then my body grew, mountain-like; desiring battle, I began to destroy that
  grove.”
'111': >-
  “That broken tract of forest, with frightened deer and birds wandering about,
  was then observed by the rākṣasīs with hideous faces as they awoke and
  looked.”
'112': >-
  “Seeing me in that forest, they gathered from here and there, and swiftly went
  and reported to Rāvaṇa.”
'113': >-
  “‘O King, this formidable forest of yours has been ruined by a wicked one—a
  monkey—unaware of your might, O mighty lord.’”
'114': >-
  “‘Because of the evil-mindedness of that one who acts against your interest, O
  King, command his execution at once, so that he may not go back again.’”
'115': >-
  “Hearing this, the lord of rākṣasas dispatched the hard-to-conquer rākṣasas
  called Kiṃkaras—followers of Rāvaṇa’s will.”
'116': >-
  “Eighty thousand of them, bearing spears and maces in their hands, I slew in
  that part of the grove with an iron bar.”
'117': >-
  “Those who survived, of swift valor, went and told Rāvaṇa that I had destroyed
  that force there in battle.”
'118': >-
  “Then a thought arose in me to demolish the excellent Caitya-prāsāda. There,
  having slain a hundred rākṣasas with a pillar,”
'119': >-
  “I, in fury, shattered that which was the ornament of Laṅkā. Then he commanded
  Jambumālī, son of Prahasta,”
'120': >-
  “together with many rākṣasas—dreadful in form and terrifying. That rākṣasa,
  endowed with strength and skilled in war,”
'121': ''
