  Now begins the thirty-ninth sarga (chapter), named “Hanuman’s Message,” in the
  Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.

  Then Sītā, having given the jewel, spoke to Hanumān: “This token of
  recognition is truly known by Rāma in its full reality.”
'2': >-
  “Indeed, on seeing this jewel, the heroic Rāma will remember three persons—my
  mother, myself, and King Daśaratha.”
'3': >-
  “Therefore, O best of monkeys, urged on again by noble enthusiasm in this
  undertaking, do consider what is to be done next.”
'4': >-
  “In this arrangement and execution of the enterprise, you are the authority, O
  best of monkeys. Consider what effort would bring about the ending of this
  sorrow.”
'5': >-
  “O Hanumān, take up the endeavor and become the means to the removal of my
  grief.” So saying “So be it,” Māruti of dreadful prowess made his pledge.
'6': >-
  Having bowed with his head to Vaidehī, he began to prepare to depart. And the
  goddess, knowing the wind-born monkey to be setting forth,
'7': >-
  the Maithilī, in a voice choked with tears, spoke these words: “O Hanumān,
  tell Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa together that they are well.”
'8': >-
  “And tell Sugrīva as well, along with his ministers, and all the aged
  monkeys—O foremost of monkeys—convey to them welfare in accordance with
  dharma.”
'9': >-
  “And as to how that mighty-armed Rāghava will deliver me from this enclosure,
  like a barrier of waters of sorrow—you should duly settle that matter.”
'10': >-
  “How the glorious Rāma should regard me as still living—this, O Hanumān, must
  be spoken by you; by such truthful speech may you attain righteousness.”
'11': >-
  “Hearing the words spoken by me—words ever joined with hope and
  energy—Daśaratha’s son’s manly valor will increase, for the sake of gaining
  me.”
'12': >-
  “And the hero Rāghava, upon hearing from you these words bearing my message,
  will, in proper manner, direct his mind toward prowess and action.”
'13': >-
  Hearing Sītā’s words, Hanumān, the son of the Wind, placing his joined palms
  upon his head in reverence, spoke in reply:
'14': >-
  “Quickly will the Kakutstha come, surrounded by the foremost of monkeys and
  bears—he who, having conquered his foes in battle, will remove your grief.”
'15': >-
  “For I do not see among mortals, nor among asuras, nor even among the gods,
  anyone who dares to stand before him while he lets fly his arrows.”
'16': >-
  “Even the Sun, even the Rain-god, even Yama the son of Vivasvān—he is able to
  withstand in battle; and all the more so for your sake.”
'17': >-
  “He is indeed capable of bringing under control this earth bounded by the
  ocean. For because of you, O daughter of Janaka, victory is assured to Rāma.”
'18': >-
  Hearing his speech—well-spoken, true, and fitting—Jānakī held those words in
  great esteem, and then said this:
'19': >-
  Then Sītā, gazing again and again at him as he was about to depart, inferred
  from affection and friendliness words filled with love for her lord, and
  spoke:
'20': >-
  “If you deem it proper, O hero, O subduer of foes, stay for one day in some
  concealed place; having rested, you may depart tomorrow.”
'21': >-
  “For me, of scant good fortune, O monkey, by your very presence there would be
  for a moment a release from this great sorrow.”
'22': >-
  “But then, O tiger among monkeys, when it is time for your return, my very
  life would become doubtful—of this there is no doubt.”
'23': >-
  “The sorrow born of not seeing you would afflict me even more, O monkey, as
  though kindling one already touched by grief upon grief.”
'24': >-
  “And this grave doubt, O hero, seems to stand before me: it is enormous, even
  with those monkey-and-bear allies, O lord of monkeys.”
'25': >-
  “How indeed will those armies of monkeys and bears, or those two sons of the
  best of men, cross the great ocean, so hard to pass?”
'26': >-
  “For in crossing the sea here, the power would belong to only three
  beings—Vainateya (Garuḍa), or you, or Māruta (the Wind) himself.”
'27': >-
  “Therefore, in this joining and execution of the task—so difficult to
  surmount—what resolution do you see? For you are foremost among those skilled
  in action.”
'28': >-
  “Indeed, you alone may be sufficient to accomplish the task, O slayer of enemy
  heroes; glorious would be the fruition of your deed.”
'29': >-
  “If, having conquered Rāvaṇa in battle by full force, you should return
  victorious to your own city—then that would be worthy of him.”
'30': >-
  “Or if the Kakutstha, crushing the enemy’s strength, should overwhelm Laṅkā
  with his forces and carry me away—then that would be worthy of him.”
'31': >-
  “Therefore, as befits the valor of that great-souled one, that hero in
  battle—so do you bring about what is appropriate.”
'32': >-
  Having heard that speech—humble, purposeful, and grounded in reason—Hanumān
  spoke further in reply:
'33': >-
  “O देवी, the lord of the monkey-and-bear hosts—the foremost among those who
  leap—Sugrīva, steadfast in truth, is firmly resolved for your sake.”
'34': >-
  “Surrounded by crores upon crores of thousands of monkeys, he will come
  swiftly, O Vaidehī, to destroy the rākṣasas.”
'35': >-
  “Possessed of valor, endowed with courage, and of great strength, the
  monkeys—who can traverse by mere intention—stand ready at his command.”
'36': >-
  “For them there is no obstruction in movement—neither upward, nor downward,
  nor across; nor do they fail in mighty deeds, being of immeasurable splendor.”
'37': >-
  “Many a time by those great-spirited ones—moving along the paths of the
  wind—has this earth, with ocean and mountains, been circumambulated.”
'38': >-
  “And there are forest-dwellers there who are superior to me and equal to me;
  none inferior to me is to be found in Sugrīva’s presence.”
'39': >-
  “I myself have come here; what then of those mighty ones? For the most
  excellent are not sent on errands—others are the ones who are dispatched.”
'40': >-
  “Therefore, enough of torment, O देवी; let your sorrow depart. In a single
  mighty advance the leaders of the monkey hosts will reach Laṅkā.”
'41': >-
  “And on my back those two will come, like the risen moon and sun—those two
  man-lions, with their great hosts, will arrive at your side.”
'42': >-
  “Those two heroes, the foremost of men—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa together—having come
  to the city of Laṅkā, will shatter it with their arrows.”
'43': >-
  “Having slain Rāvaṇa with all his followers, Rāghava, the delight of the Raghu
  line, will take you, O fair-hipped lady, and go toward his own city.”
'44': >-
  “Therefore be comforted; welfare be to you. Be one who waits for the right
  time. Before long you will see Rāma, blazing like fire.”
'45': >-
  “When the lord of rākṣasas has been slain—together with his sons, ministers,
  and kinsmen—you will be reunited with Rāma, like Rohiṇī with the moon.”
'46': >-
  “Quickly, O देवी, you will behold the far shore of sorrow, O Maithilī; and you
  will see Rāvaṇa too, slain by Rāma through his might.”
'47': >-
  Thus reassuring Vaidehī, Hanumān, the son of the Wind, having set his mind on
  departure, spoke again to her:
'48': >-
  “You will soon see Rāghava, the slayer of foes, of composed soul; and Lakṣmaṇa
  too, bow in hand, arriving at Laṅkā’s gate.”
'49': >-
  “You will soon see assembled the heroic monkeys—whose weapons are nails and
  teeth—whose valor is like that of lions and tigers, resembling lordly
  elephants.”
'50': >-
  “Upon the slopes of the Malaya mountain near Laṅkā, like mountains and clouds
  in appearance, roaring in many bands, you will see the foremost of monkeys, O
  noble lady.”
'51': >-
  “But Rāma, struck in a vital place by the dreadful arrow of Kāma (Love), finds
  no peace—like an elephant harassed by a lion.”
'52': >-
  “Weep not, O देवी, out of grief; let there be no fear in your mind. O
  beautiful one, you will meet your lord, as Śacī meets Śakra.”
'53': >-
  “Who else is superior to Rāma? Who is equal to Saumitri? Those two
  brothers—like Fire and Wind—are your refuge.”
'54': >-
  “You will not dwell long, O देवी, in this land—most dreadful, inhabited by
  troops of rākṣasas. Nor will the coming of your beloved be long delayed;
  forgive only this short time until our meeting.”
'55': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-ninth sarga (chapter), named “Hanuman’s Message,” in the
  Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic.
