  Now begins the fifty-sixth chapter, named “Dwelling at Chitrakūṭa,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then, when the night had passed and dawn had come thereafter, the delight of
  the Raghus gently awakened Lakṣmaṇa, who was still asleep.
'2': >-
  “O Saumitrī, listen to the pleasing cries of the forest birds. It is time for
  us to set forth—O best of ascetics—the moment for departure is at hand.”
'3': >-
  Thus Lakṣmaṇa, awakened at the proper time by his brother, cast off sleep and
  drowsiness, as well as the weariness that had clung to him from the toil of
  the journey.
'4': >-
  Then all of them, rising, touched the auspicious water of the river, and
  proceeded along that path toward Chitrakūṭa which had been pointed out by the
  sage.
'5': >-
  Thereafter, setting out at the fitting hour, Rāma, together with Saumitrī,
  spoke these words to Sītā, whose eyes were like lotus-petals:
'6': >-
  “O Vaidehī, behold on every side the trees, as though ablaze, all in bloom.
  See those kiṁśuka trees, garlanded with their own blossoms, when winter has
  passed away.”
'7': >-
  “See the bhallātaka trees, full of flowers, unfrequented by men, their
  branches bent low with fruits and leaves. Surely, I shall be able to live
  here.”
'8': >-
  “See, O Lakṣmaṇa, in every tree, honey in measures like droṇas hanging
  down—honey gathered by the honey-makers (bees).”
'9': >-
  “Here a krauñcha bird cries out, and that peacock answers it with a call, in
  this delightful tract of forest, thickly strewn with flowers.”
'10': >-
  “Behold this Chitrakūṭa mountain, with lofty, grown peaks, resonant with the
  calls of flocks of birds, and tracked by herds of elephants.”
'11': >-
  “On this beautiful level ground, covered with many trees, we shall sport, dear
  brother, in this holy woodland of Chitrakūṭa.”
'12': >-
  Then the two, walking on foot together with Sītā, approached that fair
  mountain—Chitrakūṭa—delightful to the mind.
'13': >-
  Having reached that mountain, filled with multitudes of diverse birds, rich in
  many roots and fruits, charming and well-supplied with water from pools and
  lakes,
'14': >-
  (Rāma said:) “This mountain is lovely, gentle one, with many kinds of trees
  and creepers. Abounding in roots and fruits, it appears to me charming and
  self-sustaining for our livelihood.”
'15': >-
  “And great-souled sages dwell upon this rocky height. Let this be our dwelling
  for the time being; here, gentle one, let us take our delight.”
'16': >-
  Thus Sītā and Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, with hands joined in reverence, went to the
  hermitage, and all of them paid homage to Vālmīki.
'17': >-
  That great sage, knower of dharma, rejoicing, honored them, and said, “Be
  seated,” and also offered them a gracious welcome.
'18': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa’s elder brother, the mighty-armed Rāma, duly introduced and
  announced himself to the sage, saying:
'19': >-
  “O Lakṣmaṇa, bring wood—firm and choice. Build us a dwelling, gentle one; my
  heart is set upon residing here.”
'20': >-
  Hearing his words, Saumitrī brought various kinds of timber, and then, O
  subduer of foes, he constructed a leaf-hut.
'21': >-
  Seeing that lovely hut, with its posts set and framework bound, and observing
  Lakṣmaṇa intent on service with single-minded devotion, Rāma spoke these
  words:
'22': >-
  “Bring the flesh of a spotted deer; we shall consecrate the hut. The rite of
  propitiation of the dwelling-site must be performed, O Saumitrī, by those who
  wish for long life.”
'23': >-
  “Having slain a deer, bring it quickly, O Lakṣmaṇa of auspicious looks.
  Remember dharma: the procedure prescribed in the śāstras must indeed be
  carried out.”
'24': >-
  Obeying his brother’s command, Lakṣmaṇa, slayer of heroes of the enemy, did
  exactly as he was told. And then Rāma spoke to him again:
'25': >-
  “Have that spotted deer cooked; we shall consecrate the hut. Make haste,
  gentle one—this moment is decisive, and this day too is assuredly auspicious
  for it.”
'26': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, the valiant Saumitrī, having slain a pure and fit black deer,
  cast it into the kindled fire, into the blazing Jātavedas.
'27': >-
  When he knew that it was cooked—well-heated and with the blood fully
  dried—Lakṣmaṇa spoke to Rāghava, the tiger among men:
'28': >-
  “This black deer is cooked, its limbs fully done. O you who are like a god
  among gods, perform the sacrifice; you are indeed well and competent to do
  so.”
'29': >-
  Rāma then bathed and, restrained and disciplined, endowed with virtues and
  skilled in sacred recitation, performed in due order all the mantras that
  conclude such a rite.
'30': >-
  Having worshipped all the hosts of gods, the pure one entered the dwelling;
  and great gladness arose in the heart of Rāma of immeasurable splendour.
'31': >-
  Having offered the oblation of Vaiśvadeva, and also the rites to Rudra and to
  Viṣṇu, and having set in motion the auspicious acts that pacify the
  dwelling-site,
'32': >-
  and having duly performed japa and bathed in the river according to rule, Rāma
  made an excellent offering that brings about the appeasement of sins.
'33': >-
  Rāghava also established arrangements appropriate to a hermitage—rites for the
  altar-ground, and sacred shrines and sanctuaries in accordance with proper
  ordinance.
'34': >-
  With forest garlands, fruits, roots, duly cooked meats according to rule; with
  Veda-prescribed prayers and japa; and with darbha grass, along with
  fuel-sticks and kuśa grass,
'35': >-
  having thus satisfied the beings (spirits and creatures) with Sītā, the two
  Rāghavas, marked by auspicious signs, then entered that well-adorned hut.
'36': >-
  That pleasing hut, roofed with the leaves of trees, well-made in the proper
  place, sheltered from the wind—into it they all entered together for
  residence, as the hosts of gods enter the assembly-hall Sudharmā.
'37': >-
  In that excellent forest, thronged with many and varied beasts and birds,
  adorned with trees bearing clusters of diverse blossoms, resonant with the
  cries of beasts and wild creatures, they sported there in great comfort, their
  senses subdued and controlled.
'38': >-
  Having reached the exceedingly beautiful Chitrakūṭa, and that river Mālyavatī
  with good fordings, he rejoiced, delighted amid the haunts of beasts and
  birds, and cast away the sorrow that had arisen from his exile from the city.
'39': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-sixth chapter, named “Dwelling at Chitrakūṭa,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the ancient and holy Rāmāyaṇa composed by the sage Vālmīki.
