  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the Eleventh Sarga
  named “Rāvaṇa’s Attainment of Laṅkā.”
'1': >-
  But Sumālī, having come to know that these night-rangers had obtained boons,
  rose up—casting off fear—together with his followers, from Rasātala.
'2': >-
  Mārīca and Prahasta, and Virūpākṣa and Mahodara—those ministers of that
  rākṣasa—rose up as well, greatly enraged and eager for action.
'3': >-
  Sumālī, surrounded by his ministers and encompassed by foremost rākṣasas,
  approached Daśagrīva; and embracing him, spoke these words:
'4': >-
  “Good fortune to you, dear child—this cherished wish that was in your mind has
  been fulfilled: that you have obtained the most excellent boon from the
  Supreme Lord of the three worlds.
'5': >-
  “Because of that same cause we abandoned Laṅkā and went down to Rasātala; but
  now, O mighty-armed one, that great fear brought about by Viṣṇu has passed
  away for us.
'6': >-
  “Again and again, terrified by that fear, abandoning our own abode, we all
  fled together and entered Rasātala.
'7': >-
  “And this Laṅkā—this city fit for rākṣasas—was established by your brother,
  the wise Lord of Wealth (Dhaneśa), as a dwelling-place.
'8': >-
  “If it can at all be accomplished, O sinless one—by conciliation and by gifts,
  or, O mighty-armed one, even by force—then let effort be made to win it back
  quickly.
'9': >-
  “But you, dear one, shall become the Lord of Laṅkā—of this there is no doubt.
  By you this rākṣasa lineage, though sunk down, has been lifted up again; and
  you, O great in strength, shall be the master of us all.”
'10': >-
  Then Daśagrīva spoke to his maternal grandsire who had come before him: “The
  Lord of Wealth is our elder and teacher; you ought not to speak such words.”
'11': >-
  Thus rebuffed by the rākṣasa-king, who was his superior, the rākṣasa said
  nothing further at that time, understanding his intention.
'12': >-
  After some time had passed, when Rāvaṇa was dwelling there, a night-ranger
  spoke to Daśagrīva words to that same effect.
'13': >-
  Prahasta then, with respectful speech, spoke these words with a reasoned
  purpose.
'14': >-
  “Daśagrīva, O mighty-armed one, it is not fitting for you to speak thus. There
  is no brotherly deference among heroes; hear, then, this word of mine.
'15': >-
  “Aditi and Diti indeed were sisters, united in affection—two supremely
  beautiful wives of Kaśyapa, the lord of progeny (Prajāpati).
'16': >-
  “Aditi gave birth to the gods, the lords of the three worlds; but Diti gave
  birth to sons, born of Kaśyapa himself.
'17': >-
  “The city of the Daityas, O knower of dharma, together with its seas, together
  with its mountains, and the whole earth, O hero—these became mighty and
  sovereign in power.
'18': >-
  “But having slain them in battle, Viṣṇu—mighty in dominion—brought these three
  worlds, imperishable, under the sway of the gods.
'19': >-
  “Not you alone will reverse this state of affairs; do, rather, what has been
  practiced by both gods and asuras—accept and act upon my counsel.”
'20': >-
  Thus addressed, Daśagrīva, inwardly delighted, reflected for a moment and then
  replied, “So be it.”
'21': >-
  And with that very joy, on that same day, the valiant Daśagrīva went to the
  forest along with those night-rangers.
'22': >-
  Dwelling then upon Trikūṭa, that night-ranger Daśagrīva dispatched, as an
  envoy, Prahasta—skilled in speech.
'23': >-
  “Prahasta, go quickly; speak to the foremost of the naiṛtas—my elder brother,
  the Lord of Wealth—these words of mine, beginning with conciliation.
'24': >-
  “‘This Laṅkā is a city, O king, of great-souled rākṣasas. It was established
  by you, gentle one; yet, O sinless one, this is not proper for you.
'25': >-
  “‘If you would indeed give it to us today, O one of incomparable prowess, my
  satisfaction would be secured, and dharma too would be upheld.’”
'26': >-
  He went to the city of Laṅkā, protected by Dhanada, and spoke this word to the
  supremely generous guardian of wealth:
'27': >-
  “I have been sent to you by your brother Daśagrīva, O one of good vows; to
  your presence, O mighty-armed one, best among all bearers of weapons.
'28': >-
  “Hear, O highly wise one, O master of all treatises, O Lord of Wealth, the
  message from me—the words that Daśānana speaks.
'29': >-
  “This lovely city, wide-eyed lord, was formerly enjoyed and possessed by
  Sumālī and the rest—by rākṣasas of dreadful valor.
'30': >-
  “Therefore he, the son of Viśravas, makes this request at present: let this be
  given, dear sir, to him who asks for it in a conciliatory manner.”
'31': >-
  Hearing Prahasta’s words, the divine Vaiśravaṇa replied to him—he who was
  skilled in speech—answering with well-chosen words:
'32': >-
  “This Laṅkā was given to me by my father when it was empty of night-rangers;
  and I have settled my yakṣas here, endowed with the virtues of generosity,
  honor, and the rest.
'33': >-
  “Go and tell Daśagrīva: this city and kingdom are mine; but you too, O
  mighty-armed one—enjoy an untroubled kingdom elsewhere, free of thorns (free
  of enemies and obstacles).”
'34': Having spoken thus, the Lord of Wealth went to his father’s presence.
'35': >-
  After bowing to his revered guru, he spoke what Rāvaṇa desired: “This
  Daśagrīva, dear father, has sent a messenger to me.
'36': >-
  “‘Let the city of Laṅkā—formerly inhabited by hosts of rākṣasas—be given.’
  What should I do in this matter? Tell me, O you of good vows.”
'37': >-
  Thus addressed, that brahmarṣi Viśravas—the foremost of sages—said to Dhanada,
  who stood with joined palms: “Listen, my son, to my words.
'38': >-
  “Daśagrīva, the mighty-armed, spoke before me; and I reproved that evil-minded
  one, again and again, with many words.
'39': >-
  “In anger I also spoke to him repeatedly—words that bring ruin. Hear, my son,
  what is wholesome, what accords with dharma, and what is rightly to be
  undertaken.
'40': >-
  “Deluded by the granting of his boon, that evil-minded one does not
  distinguish who should be honored and who should not. And due to my curse, he
  does not understand; he has entered into a dreadful nature.
'41': >-
  “Therefore go, O mighty-armed one, to Kailāsa, that mountain that bears the
  earth; abandoning Laṅkā, settle there for residence along with your followers.
'42': >-
  “There the Mandākinī—most excellent among rivers—is delightful, its waters
  covered with golden lotuses, radiant like the sun.
'43': >-
  “With white kumuda-lotuses, blue utpala-lotuses, and other fragrant flowers as
  well.
'44': >-
  “There the gods, together with gandharvas, apsarases, nāgas, and kiṁnaras—ever
  devoted to sport—rejoice constantly, having taken refuge there.
'45': >-
  “Indeed it is not proper for you, O Dhanada, to maintain enmity with this
  rākṣasa; for you know that he has obtained a supreme boon in the manner you
  have heard.
'46': >-
  Thus addressed, swiftly accepting that command out of reverence for his
  father’s word, he departed—together with wife and son, with attendants, with
  his vehicle and his riches.
'47': >-
  Then Prahasta went to Daśagrīva and delivered the message, with a delighted
  heart, to that great-souled one—together with his ministers and his younger
  brothers.
'48': >-
  “That city of Laṅkā is empty; abandoning it, Dhanada has gone away. Enter it
  along with us and uphold your own dharma (your rightful duty and rule).”
'49': >-
  Thus spoken to by Prahasta, the greatly powerful Daśagrīva entered the city of
  Laṅkā with his brothers, his forces, and his attendants.
'50': >-
  Abandoned by Dhanada, with its great roads well laid out, that foe of the gods
  ascended it, like the lord of the gods mounting heaven.
'51': >-
  And then, being consecrated by the night-rangers, Daśānana established himself
  in that city; and that city became fully filled with niśācaras, resembling
  dark rain-clouds in their hue and mass.
'52': >-
  But the Lord of Wealth, honoring his father’s command, established a city upon
  that stainless mountain of Śiva; adorned with excellently ornamented mansions,
  it shone then like Amarāvatī, the city of Purandara (Indra) himself.
'53': >-
  Thus ends the Eleventh Sarga, named “Rāvaṇa’s Attainment of Laṅkā,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
