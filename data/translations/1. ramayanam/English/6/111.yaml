  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-eleventh sarga, called “The Slaying of the Paulastya
  (Rāvaṇa).”
'1': >-
  Then Mātali spoke so as to remind Rāghava: “As though unaware, why, O hero, do
  you still follow after this one?”
'2': >-
  “Release, O lord, for his destruction, the Brahmā-given missile—the Paitāmaha
  weapon. The time of his annihilation, which the gods foretold, has come to
  pass today.”
'3': >-
  Thus reminded by Mātali’s words, Rāma seized a blazing arrow, like a hissing
  serpent drawing breath.
'4': >-
  It was that great, unfailing arrow in battle, endowed with power, which the
  holy sage Agastya had first bestowed upon him—an immense shaft granted by
  Brahmā.
'5': >-
  Formerly it had been fashioned by Brahmā, of immeasurable splendor, for
  Indra’s sake; and earlier it had been given to the lord of the gods, who
  longed for the conquest of the three worlds.
'6': >-
  Its wings were the Wind; at its tip were Fire and the Sun; its body was made
  of the substance of the sky; and in its weight were Mount Meru and Mount
  Mandara.
'7': >-
  Flaming with its own radiance, well-feathered, adorned with gold, it had been
  made to shine with the luster of the Sun by the brilliance that belongs to all
  beings.
'8': >-
  It was like Time’s fire with smoke, blazing, resembling a venomous serpent;
  swift in its operation, it was a splitter of multitudes of men, elephants, and
  horses.
'9': >-
  It could pierce gates and iron bars, and even mountains; terrible, its limbs
  were smeared with varied blood and coated with fat.
'10': >-
  Hard as the thunderbolt in substance, mighty in sound, dreadful in many
  encounters, it terrified all beings—fearsome, like a serpent that breathes and
  hisses.
'11': >-
  To kites, vultures, herons, packs of jackals, and rākṣasas it furnished a
  constant feast in war; it was the very form of Yama, bringing terror.
'12': >-
  A delight to the lords of monkeys and a bringer of ruin to the rākṣasas, it
  was drawn by steeds of many kinds, bearing the fair and wondrous marks of
  Garuḍa.
'13': >-
  That supreme arrow—destroyer of fear for the Ikṣvāku line, robber of enemies’
  fame, and a source of exultation to its wielder—Rāma took up.
'14': >-
  Then mighty-armed Rāma, having sanctified that great missile with mantras, and
  following the rite taught in the Vedas, firmly set it upon his bow.
'15': >-
  As that most excellent arrow was being fitted by Rāghava, all beings trembled,
  and the earth itself shook.
'16': >-
  Then, enraged against Rāvaṇa, drawing his bow with great force, fully intent,
  he hurled the arrow that rends vital parts.
'17': >-
  Irresistible like a thunderbolt, released from the arm of him who bears the
  thunderbolt, and uncheckable like Death itself, it fell upon Rāvaṇa’s breast.
'18': >-
  That shaft, sent forth with mighty speed—supreme, bringing an end to the
  body—split the heart of that wicked-souled Rāvaṇa.
'19': >-
  Smeared with blood, the body-ending arrow, swiftly taking away Rāvaṇa’s
  life-breaths, entered the surface of the earth.
'20': >-
  Having slain Rāvaṇa, its splendor drenched with blood, that arrow, its task
  accomplished, quietly returned again into the quiver.
'21': >-
  And from his hand, as he was swiftly struck down and his life was slipping
  away, his bow—together with the arrows—fell, as if along with his very breath.
'22': >-
  The lord of the rākṣasas, of great radiance and dreadful speed, his life
  departed, fell from the chariot onto the ground, like Vṛtra struck by Indra’s
  thunderbolt.
'23': >-
  Seeing him fallen upon the earth, the remaining night-rangers—bereft of their
  lord and terrified with fear—fled in all directions.
'24': >-
  Roaring, the monkeys—warriors who fought with trees—rushed upon them; and
  beholding the death of Daśagrīva, the monkeys, freed from grief, were
  triumphant.
'25': >-
  Assailed by the exultant monkeys, the rākṣasas fled in fear into Laṅkā; having
  lost their refuge, with faces streaming tears, they were pitiable.
'26': >-
  Then the monkeys, exulting and freed from grief, raised their cries,
  proclaiming Rāghava’s victory and the slaying of Rāvaṇa.
'27': >-
  Thereupon, in the sky resounded the auspicious drum of the gods; and a divine,
  fragrant-bearing wind blew there, exceedingly pleasant.
'28': >-
  And then from the heavens there fell upon the earth a shower of
  flowers—charming and difficult to obtain—scattering blossoms over Rāghava’s
  chariot.
'29': >-
  In the firmament were also heard praises of Rāghava, and the foremost
  utterance of the great-souled gods: “Well done! Well done!”
'30': >-
  A great joy entered the gods together with the Cāraṇas, when the fierce
  Rāvaṇa—who had been a terror to all the worlds—was slain.
'31': >-
  Then Rāghava, pleased after killing that foremost of rākṣasas, fulfilled the
  desires of Sugrīva, Aṅgada, and Vibhīṣaṇa.
'32': >-
  Then the hosts of Maruts came to rest; the quarters grew serene; the sky
  became clear; the earth ceased trembling; the wind did not blow; and the Sun
  too shone with steady radiance.
'33': >-
  Then Sugrīva, Vibhīṣaṇa, and Aṅgada—most eminent among friends—together with
  Lakṣmaṇa, came joyfully to Rāghava, delightful in battle; and, in due rite,
  they honored him for the victory.
'34': >-
  Having slain his foe and being firm in his vow, surrounded on the battlefield
  by the strength of his own people, the mighty prince of Raghu’s line
  shone—like Indra encompassed by the hosts of the gods.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-eleventh sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the
  sacred, glorious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first of poets, entitled
  “The Slaying of the Paulastya (Rāvaṇa).”
