  Then, in the revered and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa,
  begins the fortieth canto, named “Hanumān’s Supplication (Prayer).”
'1': >-
  While those bears, monkeys, and rākṣasas were thus dwelling there, Rāghava—of
  mighty splendor—spoke these words to Sugrīva:
'2': >-
  “Go, gentle one, to Kiṣkindhā—impregnable even to gods and asuras. Along with
  your ministers, protect your kingdom, now freed from thorns (its troubles and
  enemies removed).”
'3': >-
  “And you, O great-armed one, with supreme affection, look after Aṅgada, and
  also Hanumān, and Nala of exceeding strength.”
'4': >-
  “(Look after) the hero Suṣeṇa, your father-in-law; and Tārā, best among the
  strong; and Kumuda, difficult to assail; and Nīla too, of great might.”
'5': >-
  “And the hero Śatabali as well; and Mainda and Dvivida too; and Gaja, Gavākṣa,
  Gavaya, and Śarabha of mighty strength; and, being filled with affection, look
  after Gandhamādana also.”
'6': >-
  “And Ṛṣabha, of noble valor; and Jāmbavān of great might; and all these very
  great-souled ones who, for my sake, had abandoned their very lives (were ready
  to give up life).”
'7': “Look upon them with affection, and do nothing displeasing to them.”
'8': >-
  Having thus spoken to Sugrīva, and embracing him again and again, Rāma then
  addressed Vibhīṣaṇa in sweet words:
'9': >-
  “Rule Laṅkā righteously, in accordance with dharma. You are regarded by me as
  one who knows dharma; and you are accepted (approved) by your own brother as
  well, and by the city and the rākṣasas.”
'10': >-
  “And never, O king, should you at any time set your mind upon unrighteousness.
  For wise kings surely enjoy (possess) the earth.”
'11': >-
  “And I too, O king—along with Sugrīva—should always be remembered by you with
  the highest affection. Go now, free from fever (free from distress and
  agitation).”
'12': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s speech, the bears, monkeys, and rākṣasas praised Kakutstha
  again and again, saying, “Excellent, excellent!”
'13': >-
  “Great-armed one, your discernment is profound, and your valor is truly
  wondrous; and your supreme sweetness (gentleness of speech), O Rāma, is ever
  like that of Self-born Brahmā.”
'14': >-
  While the monkeys and rākṣasas were speaking thus, Hanumān, becoming humble
  (bowed in reverence), spoke a word to Rāghava:
'15': >-
  “Let my highest affection remain in you forever, O king. Let my devotion be
  steadfast, O hero; let my heart not go elsewhere.”
'16': >-
  “So long as the story of you, O hero Rāma, shall move upon the earth, so long
  will my life-breaths dwell within my body—of this there is no doubt.”
'17': >-
  “And this divine conduct (life-story) of yours, this narration, O delighter of
  the Raghu line—let it be heard by me, O bull among men, (as sung) by the
  apsarases named (so and so).”
'18': >-
  “Having heard, O hero, the nectar of your deeds, O lord, I shall then remove
  that longing of mine, as the wind drives away a line of clouds.”
'19': >-
  As Hanumān spoke thus, Rāma, rising from his excellent seat, embraced him out
  of affection and spoke these words:
'20': >-
  “So indeed it shall be, O best of monkeys—of this there is no doubt. So long
  as this story of mine shall endure in the world, so long shall your fame
  endure, and so also shall life remain in your body.”
'21': “For as long as the worlds shall stand, so long shall my story stand.”
'22': >-
  “And in the world, this (story) is mine. For each and every act of help, O
  monkey, I would give you my very life. A man attains worthiness as a vessel
  (fit recipient) when there is repayment of benefits; but (to repay) you, you
  have gone beyond measure (beyond what can be adequately requited).”
'23': >-
  Then Rāghava, unfastening from his neck a moon-bright garland, bound it upon
  Hanumān’s neck—a great necklace, shimmering with cat’s-eye gems (vaiḍūrya).
'24': >-
  With that great garland fastened upon his chest, the monkey shone—like a
  golden mountain-king with the moon resting upon its summit.
'25': >-
  Hearing these words of Rāghava, the mighty monkeys, rising and rising (again
  and again standing up in emotion), bowed their heads to his feet, and
  departed.
'26': >-
  Sugrīva too—ever clinging close to Rāma’s breast—and Vibhīṣaṇa, the
  righteous-souled, and all of them, were overcome with tears.
'27': >-
  All of them, with tear-drops (clinging), their eyes filled with tears, their
  minds bewildered as if by sorrow, then left Rāghava.
'28': >-
  Thus favored (graced) by that great-souled Rāghava, all of them went each to
  his own home, casting off their bodies as though a being were abandoning a
  body.
'29': >-
  Thereupon those rākṣasas, bears, and monkeys, bowing to Rāma, the increaser of
  the Raghu line, with eyes filled full with tears born of separation, set out
  to return—each according to his own dwelling.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the fortieth canto, named “Hanumān’s Supplication,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Prime Epic.
