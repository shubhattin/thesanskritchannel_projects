  Now begins, in the sacred and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the eleventh chapter named “The Manifestation of Vāli’s
  Might.”
'1': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words—which were gladdening and which increased valor—Sugrīva
  paid honor to Rāghava and also praised him.
'2': >-
  Without doubt, when angered, with blazing, keen arrows that strike the vital
  spots, you would burn the worlds—like the Sun at the ending of an age.
'3': >-
  As to Vāli’s manliness, his strength, and his steadfastness—having heard of
  them with a mind fixed on one intent, arrange next what should be done
  thereafter.
'4': >-
  From the western ocean to the east, and from the south even to the
  north—before the sun has risen, Vāli strides across, his fatigue gone.
'5': >-
  Mounting the foremost of mountains— even their lofty peaks—he springs upward
  with speed and power, and seizes them again, being mighty.
'6': >-
  Many trees in the forests, rich in sap and of various kinds, were shattered by
  Vāli with force, as he displayed his own strength.
'7': >-
  There was a buffalo named Dundubhi, resplendent like the peak of Kailāsa; that
  mighty one possessed the strength of a thousand elephants.
'8': >-
  That huge-bodied one—evil-minded through pride of strength, and deluded by the
  boon that had been granted—went to the ocean, lord of rivers.
'9': >-
  Crossing the billow-filled sea, a storehouse of gems, he said to the great
  ocean: “Grant me battle!”
'10': >-
  Then the ocean, righteous-souled and of great power, rose up and spoke these
  words to the asura, impelled by Time: “O king,”
'11': >-
  “I am not able to give you battle, O skilled in war. Listen; I shall tell you
  who will grant you battle.”
'12': >-
  “The king of mountains, in the great wilderness, the supreme refuge of
  ascetics—Śaṅkara’s father-in-law, famed by the name Himavān.”
'13': >-
  “Endowed with mighty waterfalls, with many caves and cascades—he is able to
  fulfill your peerless desire.”
'14': >-
  Knowing him to be afraid, that foremost of asuras came to Himavān’s forest,
  like an arrow released from the bow.
'15': >-
  Then Dundubhi hurled to the ground, in many ways, the white rocks of that
  mountain—rocks like lordly elephants—and he roared.
'16': >-
  Then Himavān, like a white cloud, gentle and of pleasing form, spoke these
  words while standing upon his own peak:
'17': >-
  “You ought not to afflict me, O Dundubhi, lover of righteousness. I am not
  skilled in the acts of battle; I am but a refuge to ascetics.”
'18': >-
  Hearing that speech of the wise king of mountains, Dundubhi spoke in anger,
  his eyes reddened:
'19': >-
  “If you are unable to fight, or are disinclined out of fear of me, then point
  out to me one who will grant me battle—for I desire to fight.”
'20': >-
  Hearing his words, Himavān—skilled in speech, righteous-souled—spoke to that
  foremost of asuras, in anger, words not spoken before:
'21': >-
  “There is a great-souled one named Vāli, illustrious monkey, highly wise, the
  puissant son of Śakra; he inhabits Kiṣkindhā, of incomparable splendor.”
'22': >-
  “That highly wise one is able, and is expert in battle; he will give you
  single combat—like Vāsava gave it to Namuçi.”
'23': >-
  “Go quickly to him, if you desire battle here. For he is ever unendurable, a
  hero in the work of war.”
'24': >-
  Hearing Himavān’s words, Dundubhi, possessed by wrath, then went to that city
  of his—Vāli’s Kiṣkindhā.
'25': >-
  Assuming the form of a buffalo—sharp-horned and dreadful—he was like a great
  rain-cloud, filled with water, in the sky.
'26': >-
  Then, coming to the gate of Kiṣkindhā, that mighty one roared, making the
  earth tremble, like a kettle-drum resounding.
'27': >-
  Breaking the trees nearby, splitting the ground with his hooves, and gouging
  at that gate with his horn in arrogance—like an elephant.
'28': >-
  Vāli, within the inner apartments, hearing the sound and being intolerant of
  insult, sprang forth with the women, like the moon with stars.
'29': >-
  Then Vāli, lord of the monkeys and of all forest-dwellers, addressed Dundubhi
  with measured words, clear in syllable and sense:
'30': >-
  “For what purpose do you bar this city-gate and roar? Dundubhi, you are known
  to me. Guard your life, O mighty one.”
'31': >-
  Hearing that speech of the wise lord of monkeys, Dundubhi spoke, his eyes
  reddened with anger:
'32': >-
  “In the presence of women, O hero, you ought not to speak. Grant me battle
  today; then shall I know your strength.”
'33': >-
  “Or else I shall restrain my wrath tonight. Let the day arise at your leisure;
  indulge in pleasures as you will, O monkey.”
'34': >-
  “Let gifts be bestowed; embrace the monkeys; you, lord of all branch-roaming
  beasts, satisfy your friends and kinsmen.”
'35': >-
  “Make Kiṣkindhā fair; make yourself equal to yourself in your city; sport
  equally with women. I am the chastiser of your pride.”
'36': >-
  “For whoever would slay one who is intoxicated, heedless, broken, alone, or
  weakened—he would be a slayer of an embryo in the world, killing one like you,
  deluded by drunken pride.”
'37': >-
  Then Vāli, smiling, spoke softly to that lord of asuras in anger, sending away
  all the women beginning with Tārā.
'38': >-
  “Do not think, ‘He is intoxicated,’ if you are afraid in battle. This
  ‘intoxication’ is for striking in this combat; let the draught of heroism be
  borne.”
'39': >-
  Having thus spoken, and being enraged, he cast up his golden garland—given by
  his father Mahendra—and took his stand for battle.
'40': >-
  Seizing Dundubhi by the horns—Dundubhi who was like a mountain—Vāli, the great
  elephant among monkeys, whirled him around, roaring.
'41': >-
  With force he began to destroy him, and he roared with a great sound; then
  blood flowed down from Dundubhi’s ears as he was struck.
'42': >-
  Then, from the fury of their wrath, each seeking to conquer the other, a
  dreadful battle arose between Dundubhi and Vāli.
'43': >-
  Then Vāli fought, equal in prowess to Śakra—using fists, knees, feet, and also
  stones and trees.
'44': >-
  As they struck each other there—monkey and asura—the asura was overcome in the
  battle, while the son of Śakra grew ever stronger.
'45': >-
  Then, lifting Dundubhi up, he dashed him to the ground; in that life-taking
  battle, Dundubhi was then crushed.
'46': >-
  Much blood flowed from his channels as he fell; and that mighty-armed one fell
  upon the earth, having attained to the state of five elements (death).
'47': >-
  Lifting with both arms that lifeless, senseless body, swift Vāli hurled it
  with one mighty cast for a full yojana.
'48': >-
  From the mouth of that one hurled with violent speed, drops of blood—lifted by
  the wind—fell toward the hermitage of Mataṅga.
'49': >-
  Seeing those drops of blood fallen there, the sage, enraged, reflected: “Who
  indeed is this, O highly fortunate one?”
'50': >-
  “By whom have I been suddenly touched by blood—by some wicked one? Who is this
  evil-minded, ill-intentioned, uncontrolled, foolish being?”
'51': >-
  So saying, the best of sages came out and saw the buffalo, mountain-like,
  lifeless, fallen on the ground.
'52': >-
  Knowing by his austerity that this had been done by a monkey, he let loose a
  great curse against the monkey who cast it.
'53': >-
  “By him this place must not be entered; if he enters, it shall be his
  death—the one by whom this forest, my refuge, has been defiled with streams of
  blood.”
'54': >-
  “By the one who hurled (this), these trees are broken, and the asura’s body is
  shattered; all around, a full yojana, my hermitage is filled (with this
  pollution).”
'55': >-
  “That ill-minded one, if he comes, surely shall not remain manifest (i.e.,
  shall meet destruction). And whatever attendants of his have taken refuge in
  my forest—”
'56': >-
  “They too must not dwell here; hearing this, let them go as they please. Or if
  they remain, I shall assuredly curse them also.”
'57': >-
  “In this forest of mine—ever protected like a son—(this deed tends) to the
  destruction of leaves and shoots, and to the loss of fruits and roots.”
'58': >-
  “Today is the boundary: if tomorrow I see that monkey, for many thousands of
  years he shall become a rock.”
'59': >-
  Then those monkeys, hearing the speech uttered by the sage, went out from that
  forest. Seeing them, Vāli spoke:
'60': >-
  “Why have you all—dwellers in Mataṅga’s forest—come near me? Is all well with
  the forest-dwellers?”
'61': >-
  Then all the monkeys told Vāli—wearing a garland of gold—the entire cause, and
  also the curse concerning Vāli.
'62': >-
  Hearing then the words spoken by the monkeys, Vāli approached the great sage
  and begged him with joined palms.
'63': >-
  The great sage disregarded him and entered his hermitage. But Vāli, fearing to
  bear the curse, became shaken and distraught.
'64': >-
  Therefore, frightened by the dread of the curse, the monkey does not wish to
  enter that great mountain Ṛṣyamūka—nor even to look upon it, O lord of men.
'65': >-
  Knowing that he does not enter, I, O Rāma, roam in this great forest with my
  counselors, free from despondency.
'66': >-
  This heap of bones of Dundubhi is seen here—large, like a mountain-peak—cast
  away due to the arrogance of his strength.
'67': >-
  And these wide śāla trees, seven, with branches spread—here Vāli is able, one
  by one, to strip them of leaves by his might.
'68': >-
  This unequaled strength of his I have revealed to you, O Rāma. How will you be
  able to slay that Vāli in battle, O king?”
'69': >-
  As Sugrīva spoke thus, Lakṣmaṇa replied with a laugh: “By accomplishing what
  deed would you have faith in Vāli’s death?”
'70': >-
  Then Sugrīva said: “These seven śāla trees—formerly Vāli pierced them thus,
  one by one, and he did so repeatedly.”
'71': >-
  “If Rāma would split one of these trees with a single arrow, then, seeing
  Rāma’s prowess, I deem Vāli as good as slain.”
'72': >-
  “And the bone of the slain buffalo—lifting it with one foot, O Lakṣmaṇa—he
  could also fling it swiftly two hundred bow-lengths.”
'73': >-
  Having said thus, Sugrīva—his eyes red at the corners—meditated for a moment
  on Rāma, the son of Kakutstha, and spoke again:
'74': >-
  “Heroic and proud of heroism, famed for strength and manliness—Vāli is a
  mighty monkey, unconquered in battles.”
'75': >-
  “And his deeds are seen—deeds difficult even for the gods—to reflect upon
  which I, afraid, have taken refuge at Ṛṣyamūka.”
'76': >-
  “Thinking on that unconquerable, unassailable, intolerant lord of monkeys, I
  do not abandon this Ṛṣyamūka.”
'77': >-
  “Anxious and apprehensive, I wander in this great forest with loyal
  ministers—excellent ones—headed by Hanumān.”
'78': >-
  “And I have obtained a noble good friend, devoted to friends: you, O tiger
  among men, as though I had taken refuge in Himavān.”
'79': >-
  “Yet I know the strength of that powerful, wicked brother of mine; but your
  valor in battle, O Rāghava, is not directly known to me.”
'80': >-
  “Indeed I do not compare you, nor do I slight you, nor do I seek to frighten
  you; but by his dreadful deeds, cowardice has been produced in me.”
'81': >-
  “Your speech, your authority, your steadfastness, and your form, O Rāghava,
  indicate supreme radiance—like fire hidden under ashes.”
'82': >-
  Hearing that speech of great-souled Sugrīva, Rāma, with a smile first, replied
  to the monkey:
'83': >-
  “If you have no confidence in our prowess, O monkey, I shall produce for you,
  in battle, a commendable assurance.”
'84': >-
  Having thus spoken, and comforting Sugrīva, Rāghava, elder brother of
  Lakṣmaṇa, with playfulness (lit. as a sport) lifted Dundubhi’s body with his
  great toe.
'85': >-
  The mighty-armed, valorous one lifted and hurled, with his great toe, the dry
  body of the asura for ten yojanas.
'86': >-
  Seeing that body hurled, Sugrīva again spoke this meaningful speech to
  Rāma—who stood like the scorching sun—in front of Lakṣmaṇa and before the
  monkeys:
'87': >-
  “Formerly, friend, this body was moist, fleshy, and fresh, when it was cast by
  my brother Vāli—then weary and intoxicated.”
'88': >-
  “But now it is light, devoid of flesh, and like mere straw, O Rāghava; yet
  thus have you hurled it in exhilaration, O delight of the Raghus.”
'89': >-
  “By this, it is not possible to know whose strength is greater—yours or
  his—for this difference of ‘moist’ and ‘dry’ is very great, O Rāghava.”
'90': >-
  “That doubt, dear one—about your strength and his—would be made clear as to
  strength and weakness, if you would pierce a single śāla tree.”
'91': >-
  Having strung this bow—drawn out like an elephant’s trunk—draw it back until
  the ear is filled (i.e., to the full draw), and release a great arrow.
'92': >-
  For the arrow shot by you at this śāla will, without doubt, split it—there is
  no uncertainty in this. Enough of deliberation: do what is surely dear to me,
  O king, for I have been smitten by a curse.
'93': >-
  As among luminaries the sun is supreme in splendor; as among great mountains
  Himavān is the greatest; and as among four-footed beasts the lion is the
  best—so among men, in valor, you are the foremost.
'94': >-
  Thus ends the eleventh chapter, named “The Manifestation of Vāli’s Might,” in
  the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic.
