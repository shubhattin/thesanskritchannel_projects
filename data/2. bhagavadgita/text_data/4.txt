॥ ॐ श्री परमात्मने नमः ॥
AUM shrI paramAtmane namaH

I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness

॥ अथ श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता ॥
atha shrImadbhagavadgItA

And Now, We start the Holy Bhagavadgita

अथ चतुर्थोऽध्यायः ।   ज्ञानकर्मसंन्यासयोगः
atha chaturthoadhyAyaH    jnAnakarmasannyAsaYogaH

Thus starts the fourth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, which describes jnAnakarmasannyAsaYogaH, where Lord Krishna delves into ###.

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
shrIbhagavAnuvAcha 

Coninuing to clarify Arjuna's confused questions, Lord Krishna speaks thus:

इमं विवस्वते योगं प्रोक्तवानहमव्ययम् ।
विवस्वान्मनवे प्राह मनुरिक्ष्वाकवेऽब्रवीत् ॥ ४-१॥
imaM vivasvate YogaaM proktavAnahamavyayam 
vivasvAnmanave prAha manurikShvAkaveabravIt  4.1

O Arjuna, I spoke of this eternal science of Yoga to the Sun Deity=Vivasvan;
He then passed it on to Manu;
who in turn instructed it to Ikshvaku.

एवं परम्पराप्राप्तमिमं राजर्षयो विदुः ।
स कालेनेह महता योगो नष्टः परन्तप ॥ ४-२॥
evaM paramparAprAptamimaM rAjarShayo viduH 
sa kAleneha mahatA Yogao naShTaH parantapa  4.2

O Arjuna, the greatest of sages thus received this science of Yoga in a continuous tradition. 
But with a long passage of time, this knowledge slowly got lost.

स एवायं मया तेऽद्य योगः प्रोक्तः पुरातनः ।
भक्तोऽसि मे सखा चेति रहस्यं ह्येतदुत्तमम् ॥ ४-३॥
sa evAyaM mayA teadya YogaaH proktaH purAtanaH 
bhaktoasi me sakhA cheti rahasyaM hyetaduttamam  4.3

Today, I have spoken to you of this very same science of yoga, which is of great antiquity.
I only imparted this secret treasure to you since you are devoted to me, and I consider you a dear friend.

अर्जुन उवाच ।
arjuna uvAcha

Arjuna, then asked the following question.
 
अपरं भवतो जन्म परं जन्म विवस्वतः ।
कथमेतद्विजानीयां त्वमादौ प्रोक्तवानिति ॥ ४-४॥
aparaM bhavato janma paran janma vivasvataH 
kathametadvijAnIyAn tvamAdau proktavAniti  4.4

O Krishna, the birth of the Sun Deity is beyond your lifetime.
How then do I understand that you spoke of this to him!?

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
shrIbhagavAnuvAcha 

Lord Krishna then explained thus

बहूनि मे व्यतीतानि जन्मानि तव चार्जुन ।
तान्यहं वेद सर्वाणि न त्वं वेत्थ परन्तप ॥ ४-५॥
bahUni me vyatItAni janmAni tava chArjuna 
tAnyahaM veda sarvANi na tvaM vettha parantapa  4.5

Both you and I have had many lifetimes, O Arjuna. 
You have forgotten them, while I remember them all!

अजोऽपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोऽपि सन् ।
प्रकृतिं स्वामधिष्ठाय सम्भवाम्यात्ममायया ॥ ४-६॥
ajoapi sannavyayAtmA bhUtAnAmIshvaroapi san 
prakRtin svAmadhiShThAya sambhavAmyAtmamAyayA  4.6

Even though I am without birth or decay;
Even though I have absolute control over all elements of creation;
I exist as a part of this creation, through the illusion of my own self.

यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत ।
अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ॥ ४-७॥
yadA yadA hi dharmasya glAnirbhavati bhArata 
abhyutthAnamadharmasya tadAtmAnaM sRjAmyaham  4.7

As and when there is a disturbance to dharma=that which sustains balance;
and there is an uprising of adharma=imbalance that leads to unsustainability;
O Arjuna, I then create my own self in this creation.

परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम् ।
धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगे युगे ॥ ४-८॥
paritrANAya sAdhUnAn vinAshAya cha duShkRtAm 
dharmasansthApanArthAya sambhavAmi yuge yuge  4.8

In order to protect that which leads to balance; and to destroy that which leads to imbalance;
In order to establish dharma=the law that sustains, I manifest again and again.

जन्म कर्म च मे दिव्यमेवं यो वेत्ति तत्त्वतः ।
त्यक्त्वा देहं पुनर्जन्म नैति मामेति सोऽर्जुन ॥ ४-९॥
janma karma cha me divyamevaM yo vetti tattvataH 
tyaktvA dehaM punarjanma naiti mAmeti soarjuna  4.9

Those who understand the divine nature of my birth and my activity,
O Arjuna, upon leaving the body, they break the cycles of life and death, and attain me.

वीतरागभयक्रोधा मन्मया मामुपाश्रिताः ।
बहवो ज्ञानतपसा पूता मद्भावमागताः ॥ ४-१०॥
vItarAgabhayakrodhA manmayA mAmupAshritAH 
bahavo jnAnatapasA pUtA madbhAvamAgatAH  4.10

By letting go of their entanglement, fear and anger, many have taken refuge in me; 
They have thus become one with me, through their intensity of knowledge.

ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम् ।
मम वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थ सर्वशः ॥ ४-११॥
ye yathA mAM prapadyante tAnstathaiva bhajAmyaham 
mama vartmAnuvartante manuShyAH pArtha sarvashaH  4.11

Through whichever means, people reach out to me, I reach back to them through the same means.
Everyone follows my path, in so many different ways, O Arjuna.

काङ्क्षन्तः कर्मणां सिद्धिं यजन्त इह देवताः ।
क्षिप्रं हि मानुषे लोके सिद्धिर्भवति कर्मजा ॥ ४-१२॥
kAnkShantaH karmaNAn siddhin yajanta iha devatAH 
kShipran hi mAnuShe loke siddhirbhavati karmajA  4.12

Those who desire results to their actions, worship deities in this world.
Here, humans attain to quick results only through their karma=activity.

चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागशः ।
तस्य कर्तारमपि मां विद्ध्यकर्तारमव्ययम् ॥ ४-१३॥
chAturvarNyaM mayA sRShTan guNakarmavibhAgashaH 
tasya kartAramapi mAn vidhdhyakartAramavyayam  4.13

Based on one's guNas=qualities and karmas=activities, I have created a four fold spectrum.
Although I am the creator of this spectrum, know that I am without activity and without change.

न मां कर्माणि लिम्पन्ति न मे कर्मफले स्पृहा ।
इति मां योऽभिजानाति कर्मभिर्न स बध्यते ॥ ४-१४॥
na mAn karmANi limpanti na me karmaphale spRhA 
iti mAn yoabhijAnAti karmabhirna sa badhyate  4.14

Activities do not taint me, nor do I desire the fruits of action. 
One who knows me thus, is never entangled in activity.

एवं ज्ञात्वा कृतं कर्म पूर्वैरपि मुमुक्षुभिः ।
कुरु कर्मैव तस्मात्त्वं पूर्वैः पूर्वतरं कृतम् ॥ ४-१५॥
evam jnAtvA kRtaM karma pUrvairapi mumukShubhiH 
kuru karmaiva tasmAttvaM pUrvaiH pUrvataran kRtam  4.15

Even in the past, seekers of liberation performed their activity with this realization.
Therefore, follow in their footsteps and perform activity in such a way.

किं कर्म किमकर्मेति कवयोऽप्यत्र मोहिताः ।
तत्ते कर्म प्रवक्ष्यामि यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽशुभात् ॥ ४-१६॥
kim karma kimakarmeti kavayoapyatra mohitAH 
tatte karma pravakShyAmi yajjnAtvA mokShyaseashubhAt  4.16

Even the wise are confused as to the distinction between detached activty and just laziness.
I shall now explain the nature of true activity, upon knowing which you shall be free from the inauspicious.

कर्मणो ह्यपि बोद्धव्यं बोद्धव्यं च विकर्मणः ।
अकर्मणश्च बोद्धव्यं गहना कर्मणो गतिः ॥ ४-१७॥
karmaNo hyapi boddhavyaM boddhavyan cha vikarmaNaH 
akarmaNashcha boddhavyan gahanA karmaNo gatiH  4.17

You must understand the true nature of acivity;
the nature of wrong approach to activity;
and the nature of giving up activity;
This knowledge of activity is deep and subtle.

कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः ।
स बुद्धिमान्मनुष्येषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत् ॥ ४-१८॥
karmaNyakarma yaH pashyedakarmaNi cha karma yaH 
sa buddhimAnmanuShyeShu sa yuktaH kRtsnakarmakRt  4.18

Those who see action in inaction and inaction in action are truly wise amongst humans. 
They are involved in performing all kinds of activity without being entangled by it.

यस्य सर्वे समारम्भाः कामसङ्कल्पवर्जिताः ।
ज्ञानाग्निदग्धकर्माणं तमाहुः पण्डितं बुधाः ॥ ४-१९॥
yasya sarve samArambhAH kAmasankalpavarjitAH 
jnAnAgnidagdhakarmANan tamAhuH paNDitaM budhAH  4.19

Those who start all activity without fixating upon the end-result;
with their activity purified in the fire of knowledge;
such people are known as the truly wise ones.

त्यक्त्वा कर्मफलासङ्गं नित्यतृप्तो निराश्रयः ।
कर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किञ्चित्करोति सः ॥ ४-२०॥
tyaktvA karmaphalAsangan nityadtRpto nirAshrayaH 
karmaNyabhipravRttoapi naiva kinchitkaroti saH  4.20

Such people, having given up entanglement to the fruits of their actions, are always satisfied and not dependent on external things. Despite engaging in activities, they do not do anything at all.

निराशीर्यतचित्तात्मा त्यक्तसर्वपरिग्रहः ।e
शारीरं केवलं कर्म कुर्वन्नाप्नोति किल्बिषम् ॥ ४-२१॥
nirAshIryatachittAtmA tyaktasarvaparigrahaH 
shArIraM kevalaM karma kurvannApnoti kilbiSham  4.21

The one who is rid of desire, with his mind under the control of the self, who has no sense of possession over anything, such a person will use one's physical body just as a tool towards action, and doesn't get entangled.

यदृच्छालाभसन्तुष्टो द्वन्द्वातीतो विमत्सरः ।
समः सिद्धावसिद्धौ च कृत्वापि न निबध्यते ॥ ४-२२॥
yadRchChAlAbhasantuShTo dvandvAtIto vimatsaraH 
samaH siddhAvasiddhau cha kRtvApi na nibadhyate  4.22

Content with whatever gain comes one's way, and free from envy, they are beyond the dualities of life. Being equanimous in success and failure, they are not bound by their actions, even while performing all kinds of activities.

गतसङ्गस्य मुक्तस्य ज्ञानावस्थितचेतसः ।
यज्ञायाचरतः कर्म समग्रं प्रविलीयते ॥ ४-२३॥
gatasangasya muktasya jnAnAvasthitachetasaH 
yajnAyAcharataH karma samagraM pravilIyate  4.23

For the ones who are free of entanglements, with their intellect established in knowledge, who perform all activity as a yajna, everything leads to dissolution.

ब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्म हविर्ब्रह्माग्नौ ब्रह्मणा हुतम् ।
ब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यं ब्रह्मकर्मसमाधिना ॥ ४-२४॥
brahmArpaNaM brahma havirbrahmAgnau brahmaNA hutam 
brahmaiva tena gantavyaM brahmakarmasamAdhinA  4.24

It is the all pervading consciouness which is the consumed, it is the means of consumption, it is the cause of consumption, and it is that which consumes.
Therefore, what is consumed, goes back into its own self, through activity which is performed with an equanimous mind established in consciousness. 

दैवमेवापरे यज्ञं योगिनः पर्युपासते ।
ब्रह्माग्नावपरे यज्ञं यज्ञेनैवोपजुह्वति ॥ ४-२५॥
daivamevApare yajnan YogainaH paryupAsate 
brahmAgnAvapare yajnaM yajnenaivopajuhvati  4.25

Some Yogis perform yajna to worship deities making offerings to them.
While others perform a yanja which is beyond that, by offering their own activity into the fire of all pervading consciousness.

श्रोत्रादीनीन्द्रियाण्यन्ये संयमाग्निषु जुह्वति ।
शब्दादीन्विषयानन्य इन्द्रियाग्निषु जुह्वति ॥ ४-२६॥
shrotrAdInIndriyANyanye sanyamAgniShu juhvati 
shabdAdInviShayAnanya indriyAgniShu juhvati  4.26

They offer their hearing and other senses of perception in the fire of self-control.
While others offer sound and other objects of the senses into the fire of the senses.

सर्वाणीन्द्रियकर्माणि प्राणकर्माणि चापरे ।
आत्मसंयमयोगाग्नौ जुह्वति ज्ञानदीपिते ॥ ४-२७॥
sarvANIndriyakarmANi prANakarmANi chApare 
AtmasanyamaYogaAgnau juhvati jnAnadIpite  4.27

While some others who are enlightened by knowledge, offer the functions of all their senses and their life energy into the fire of a constantly realized self.

द्रव्ययज्ञास्तपोयज्ञा योगयज्ञास्तथापरे ।
स्वाध्यायज्ञानयज्ञाश्च यतयः संशितव्रताः ॥ ४-२८॥
dravyayajnAstapoyajnA YogaayajnAstathApare 
svAdhyAyajnAnayajnAshcha yatayaH sanshitavratAH  4.28

Of all the yajnas mentioned before, the yajna of self-austerity, is beyond the yajna of material offerings.
Even beyond that is the yajna of yoga, which aims towards realizing the true self.
And even beyond that is the yajna of knowledge through the study of one's own self, with a steadfast focus.

अपाने जुह्वति प्राणं प्राणेऽपानं तथापरे ।
प्राणापानगती रुद्ध्वा प्राणायामपरायणाः ॥ ४-२९॥
apAne juhvati prANaM prANeapAnaM tathApare 
prANApAnagatI rudhdhvA prANAyAmaparAyaNAH  4.29

In this process of yajna, some offer the outgoing breath into the incoming breath, while some offer the incoming breath into the outgoing breath. 
They rigorously practice prāṇāyāma by absolute control over the incoming and outgoing breaths, which gives access to the very life energies.

अपरे नियताहाराः प्राणान्प्राणेषु जुह्वति ।
सर्वेऽप्येते यज्ञविदो यज्ञक्षपितकल्मषाः ॥ ४-३०॥
apare niyatAhArAH prANAnprANeShu juhvati 
sarveapyete yajnavido yajnakShapitakalmaShAH  4.30

Yet others performa another kind of yajna, where they curtail their intake and consumption and offer their breath into their very own life-energy. 
All of the above mentioned, who have the knowledge of yajna, are gradually cleansed of their faults.

यज्ञशिष्टामृतभुजो यान्ति ब्रह्म सनातनम् ।
नायं लोकोऽस्त्ययज्ञस्य कुतोऽन्यः कुरुसत्तम ॥ ४-३१॥
yajnashiShTAmRtabhujo yAnti brahma sanAtanam 
nAyaM lokoastyayajnasya kutoanyaH kurusattama  4.31

The ones who consume the nectar like outcome of such yajnas, attain to the eternal consciousness.
For the ones who do not know of any kind of yajna, there is nothing to attain in this world, then where does the question of attaining the beyond arise, O Arjuna!

एवं बहुविधा यज्ञा वितता ब्रह्मणो मुखे ।
कर्मजान्विद्धि तान्सर्वानेवं ज्ञात्वा विमोक्ष्यसे ॥ ४-३२॥
evaM bahuvidhA yajnA vitatA brahmaNo mukhe 
karmajAnviddhi tAnsarvAnevaM jnAtvA vimokShyase  4.32

And thus various kinds of yajna have been expounded upon by the creator.
All of them are born out of activity=karma. Know these yajnas, and attain to liberation.

श्रेयान्द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञाज्ज्ञानयज्ञः परन्तप ।
सर्वं कर्माखिलं पार्थ ज्ञाने परिसमाप्यते ॥ ४-३३॥
shreyAndravyamayAdyajnAjjnAnayajnaH parantapa 
sarvan karmAkhilaM pArtha jnAne parisamApyate  4.33

O Arjuna, the yajna of knowledge will lead you to a better state of well-being than the yajna of material offerings.
All entanglement with activity will thus stop, with true knowledge. 

O subduer of enemies, sacrifice performed in knowledge is superior to any mechanical material sacrifice. After all, O Parth, all sacrifices of work culminate in knowledge.

तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया ।

tadviddhi praNipAtena pariprashnena sevayA 
upadekShyanti te jnAnaM jnAninastattvadarshinaH  4.34

Those who are realized can bestow this true knowledge to you.
Know that knowledge by taking refuge in them, by clarifying your doubts with them, and by service to them.
 
यज्ज्ञात्वा न पुनर्मोहमेवं यास्यसि पाण्डव ।
येन भूतान्यशेषेण द्रक्ष्यस्यात्मन्यथो मयि ॥ ४-३५॥
yajjnAtvA na punarmohamevaM yAsyasi pANDava 
yena bhUtAnyasheSheNa drakShyasyAtmanyatho mayi  4.35

Following this path and having achieved this knowledge, O Arjuna, you will no longer fall back into delusion. 
In the light of that knowledge, you will see the unity in all beings, as I see it within me.

अपि चेदसि पापेभ्यः सर्वेभ्यः पापकृत्तमः ।
सर्वं ज्ञानप्लवेनैव वृजिनं सन्तरिष्यसि ॥ ४-३६॥
api chedasi pApebhyaH sarvebhyaH pApakRttamaH 
sarvan jnAnaplavenaiva vRjinaM santariShyasi  4.36

Even if you have committed the worst of sins, O Arjuna, this boat of true knowledge, will take you across the endless ocean of life and death.

यथैधांसि समिद्धोऽग्निर्भस्मसात्कुरुतेऽर्जुन ।
ज्ञानाग्निः सर्वकर्माणि भस्मसात्कुरुते तथा ॥ ४-३७॥
yathaidhAnsi samiddhoagnirbhasmasAtkurutearjuna 
jnAnAgniH sarvakarmANi bhasmasAtkurute tathA  4.37

As a kindled fire reduces wood to ashes, O Arjuna, the fire of knowledge burns down all activity.

न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते ।
तत्स्वयं योगसंसिद्धः कालेनात्मनि विन्दति ॥ ४-३८॥
na hi jnAnena sadRshaM pavitramiha vidyate 
tatsvayaM YogaasansiddhaH kAlenAtmani vindati  4.38

In this world, there is nothing as pure as true knowledge. 
One who is prepared for yoga, knows this experientially within one's own self in due time.

श्रद्धावाँल्लभते ज्ञानं तत्परः संयतेन्द्रियः ।
ज्ञानं लब्ध्वा परां शान्तिमचिरेणाधिगच्छति ॥ ४-३९॥
shraddhAvANllabhate jnAnaM tatparaH sanyatendriyaH 
jnAnaM labdhvA parAM shAntimachireNAdhigachChati  4.39

The one with a steady focus attains to knowledge.
The one who is in control over one's senses attains knowledge that is further beyond.
Once that is attained, one is quickly established in unwavering peace within.

अज्ञश्चाश्रद्दधानश्च संशयात्मा विनश्यति ।
नायं लोकोऽस्ति न परो न सुखं संशयात्मनः ॥ ४-४०॥
ajnashchAshraddadhAnashcha sanshayAtmA vinashyati 
nAyaM lokoasti na paro na sukhaM sanshayAtmanaH  4.40

The one without knowledge or focus; the one who is constant dilemma is destroyed.
For such a person, the options here and beyond, are both lost;
There is no pleasantness anywhere for someone in constant doubt.

योगसंन्यस्तकर्माणं ज्ञानसञ्छिन्नसंशयम् ।

YogaasannyastakarmANaM jnAnasanChinnasanshayam 
AtmavantaM na karmANi nibadhnanti dhananjaya  4.41

O Arjuna, actions do not bind those, whose acts are established in yoga;
whose dilemmas have been destroyed by knowledge;
and those who are established within their true self.

तस्मादज्ञानसम्भूतं हृत्स्थं ज्ञानासिनात्मनः ।

tasmAdajnAnasambhUtaM hRtsthan jnAnAsinAtmanaH 
ChittvainaM sanshayaM YogaamAtiShThottiShTha bhArata  4.42

O Descendant of Bharata, the doubt in your heart is born out of ignorance.
Destroy it with the sword of knowledge of your true self.
Establish yourself in Yoga, and arise.

And thus ends the fourth chapter, by the name of jnAnakarmasannyAsa yogah.
This is taken from Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of Yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality, called as brahma vidya.
