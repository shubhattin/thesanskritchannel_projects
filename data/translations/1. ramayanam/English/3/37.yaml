  Now begins the thirty-seventh canto in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, named “Admonition that is Unpleasant yet Wholesome.”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of the lord of the rākṣasas, Mārīca—mighty in splendor and
  well-versed in speech—answered the rākṣasa-king in reply.
'2': >-
  Men, O King, who speak what is pleasing are easily found at all times; but the
  speaker—and likewise the hearer—of what is unpleasant yet salutary is
  difficult to find.
'3': >-
  Surely you do not comprehend Rāma—exalted in great heroism and noble
  qualities—who is like Indra and Varuṇa, and who is not to be approached with
  heedless and fickle conduct.
'4': >-
  May it be well, dear one, for all the rākṣasas; may Rāma, if provoked to
  wrath, not make the worlds bereft of rākṣasas.
'5': >-
  Would that the daughter of Janaka had never come into being for the ending of
  your life; and would that, because of Sītā as the cause, a great calamity
  might not arise.
'6': >-
  Would that, by attaining you as lord—unrestrained, moving by desire—Laṅkā,
  together with you and all the rākṣasas, might not perish.
'7': >-
  For a king of your sort, driven by desire, of ill conduct, and counseled in
  sin—such a wicked-minded ruler destroys himself, his own people, and his
  realm.
'8': >-
  Rāma, however, is in no way one abandoned by his father, nor is he one who
  transgresses rightful bounds; neither is he greedy, nor ill-natured, nor the
  dregs of the kṣatriyas.
'9': >-
  Nor is he devoid of the virtues of dharma—he who increases the joy of
  Kausalyā; nor is he harsh toward beings, for he is devoted to the welfare of
  all creatures.
'10': >-
  Seeing his father Daśaratha—truthful though deceived by Kaikeyī—Rāma,
  righteous-souled, said, “I shall do it,” and then departed to the forest.
'11': >-
  For fulfilling Kaikeyī’s cherished desire and also that of his father
  Daśaratha, he abandoned kingdom and enjoyments and entered the Daṇḍaka forest.
'12': >-
  Rāma is not harsh, dear one; he is not ignorant; he is not one whose senses
  are unconquered. Such a false report has not been heard, and you ought not to
  speak so.
'13': >-
  Rāma is Dharma embodied—virtuous, with valor grounded in truth—king, as it
  were, of the entire world, like Vāsava (Indra) among the gods.
'14': >-
  How do you desire to seize by force Vaidehī, protected by his own
  splendor—like the radiance belonging to the Sun?
'15': >-
  You ought not to enter at once into the fire that is Rāma—suddenly
  kindled—whose flames are arrows, whose fuel in battle is bow and sword, and
  who is unassailable.
'16': >-
  His bow is like a gaping, blazing mouth; his arrows are fiery rays; he is
  intolerant of affront, bearing bow and arrows, keen, and the destroyer of the
  enemy’s host.
'17': >-
  Having abandoned kingdom and happiness, and even life itself dear to him, you
  ought not, dear one, to draw near to Rāma, who will prove the end of you here.
'18': >-
  Immeasurable indeed is the splendor of him whose consort is the daughter of
  Janaka. You are not capable of carrying her off in the forest when she abides
  under the protection of Rāma’s bow.
'19': >-
  To that lion among men, broad-chested as a lion, his radiant wife—ever
  faithful and devoted— is dearer even than his own life-breaths.
'20': >-
  She cannot be violated—Maithilī, beloved of the vigorous one. Sītā of slender
  waist is like the flame of a blazing fire.
'21': >-
  Why, O lord of rākṣasas, undertake this futile effort? If you are seen by him
  in battle, then your life will come to its end thereupon.
'22': >-
  If you wish to enjoy for a long time life, happiness, and the exceedingly
  hard-to-obtain sovereignty, do not act in a manner hostile to Rāma.
'23': >-
  Having deliberated together with all his counselors, with Vibhīṣaṇa at their
  head—with those steadfast in dharma—and having made a resolve within himself,
  and having weighed the faults and the merits, and having assessed strength and
  weakness,
'24': >-
  And having truly understood his own power and the power of Rāghava, you ought
  to do what is fitting—having firmly determined what is beneficial for you.
'25': >-
  But I, for my part, deem it not fitting for you to meet in battle the son of
  the king of Kosala. Hear again this excellent counsel—proper and
  well-reasoned, O lord of the night-rangers.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-seventh canto in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the great primordial epic, named “Admonition that is
  Unpleasant yet Wholesome.”
