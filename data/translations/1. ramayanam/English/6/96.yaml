  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninety-sixth sarga, called “The Arming and Going Forth of Rāvaṇa
  (Rāvaṇābhiṣeṇanam).”
'1': >-
  Then, in Laṅkā, in each and every household of the rākṣasī women who were
  afflicted and distressed, Rāvaṇa heard the piteous sound of lamentation and
  wailing.
'2': >-
  He, drawing a long breath, remained for a moment absorbed in thought; and
  Rāvaṇa, terrible to behold, became exceedingly enraged.
'3': >-
  Biting his lip with his teeth, his eyes reddened with wrath, he became—hard to
  look upon even for the rākṣasas—like embodied Time-fire (the blazing fire of
  dissolution).
'4': >-
  And the lord of the rākṣasas spoke to the rākṣasas who stood near him there,
  his speech veiling his fury, as though burning them with his eyes.
'5': >-
  “Mahodara, Mahāpārśva, and the rākṣasa Virūpākṣa—quickly give the word: let
  the armies march out, by my command.”
'6': >-
  Hearing that command of his, those rākṣasas, stricken with fear, hastened to
  urge on the rākṣasa forces—on the king’s order.
'7': >-
  And all those rākṣasas, terrible to behold, replying, “So be it,” and having
  performed auspicious rites of well-being, marched facing toward the
  battlefield.
'8': >-
  Honoring Rāvaṇa duly according to custom, those great chariot-warriors all
  stood with joined palms, desiring their lord’s victory.
'9': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa, overwhelmed with wrath, spoke to them with a grim
  smile—addressing Mahodara, Mahāpārśva, and the rākṣasa Virūpākṣa:
'10': >-
  “Today, with arrows released from my bow, blazing like the sun at the end of
  an age, I shall send Rāghava and Lakṣmaṇa to the abode of Yama.
'11': >-
  “Today I shall exact requital, by slaying the enemy, for Khara, for
  Kumbhakarṇa, and likewise for Prahasta and Indrajit.
'12': >-
  “Neither the sky, nor the quarters of space, nor heaven itself, nor even the
  oceans shall remain visible, being covered by the cloud-mass of my arrows.
'13': >-
  “Today I shall slay, portion by portion, those troops of the foremost among
  monkeys, with my bow—by a net of arrows—like birds struck down.”
'14': >-
  “Today, with my chariot and the force of the wind, I shall churn and crush the
  monkey armies with my waves of arrows that have arisen from the ocean of my
  bow.”
'15': >-
  “Today I shall trample the monkey-troops—whose faces are like opened lotuses
  and whose splendor is like lotus-filaments—like an elephant tramples ponds.”
'16': >-
  “Today, in battle, the leaders of the monkey-troops, pierced through with my
  arrows in their mouths, shall adorn the earth, like lotuses with their
  stalks.”
'17': >-
  “Today, in war, with a single released arrow I shall split and shatter, by
  hundreds upon hundreds, those fierce leaders of troops among the
  monkeys—fighters with trees.”
'18': >-
  “Those whose brother has indeed been slain, and those whose son has been
  slain—by killing the foe today, I shall wipe away their tears.”
'19': >-
  “Today, in battle, I shall cover the earth with monkeys, pierced by my arrows,
  strewn about, and bereft of consciousness—so that the ground will seem as
  though carefully observed and measured out.”
'20': >-
  “Today I shall satiate all the crows and vultures, and the other flesh-eaters
  as well, with the flesh of the enemies struck down by my arrows.”
'21': >-
  “Let my chariot be made ready at once; let my bow be brought swiftly. Let
  those night-rangers who remain here follow after me into battle.”
'22': >-
  Hearing that speech of his, Mahāpārśva spoke: “Let the army be quickly made
  ready,” addressing the commanders of the forces who were standing there.
'23': >-
  And the commanders, assembled, went about Laṅkā from house to house, urging
  those rākṣasas on—men of swift valor.
'24': >-
  Then, within a short while, rākṣasas, terrible to behold, rushed
  forth—roaring, with dreadful faces, their arms bearing many kinds of weapons.
'25': >-
  With swords, spears, tridents, clubs, maces, ploughshares; with śaktis of
  sharp edge; and with massive hammer-like cudgels,
'26': >-
  with staves, with diverse discus-weapons, with keen axes, with bhindipālas,
  with śataghnīs, and with other excellent weapons besides,
'27': >-
  then, by Rāvaṇa’s command, four commanders brought: a little over a niyuta of
  chariots, and three niyutas of elephants.
'28': >-
  And sixty crores of horses, and likewise of asses and camels; and
  foot-soldiers beyond counting—all these went forth by the king’s command.
'29': >-
  And while the commanders arranged the king’s army, stationed in front, in that
  very interval the charioteer set that chariot in place.
'30': >-
  It was furnished with the choicest divine missiles, adorned with many
  ornaments, crowded with many weapons, and fitted with a network of tinkling
  bells.
'31': >-
  It was studded all around with many jewels, resplendent with jewel-pillars,
  and surrounded with a thousand golden water-pots of Jāmbūnada gold.
'32': >-
  Seeing it, all the rākṣasas fell into the highest astonishment; and seeing it,
  Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, rose at once.
'33': >-
  That chariot, radiant like ten million suns, blazing as it were like
  fire—swift, attended by its charioteer, yoked with eight horses—Rāvaṇa then
  mounted: a terrible car, shining with its own splendor.
'34': >-
  Then he set out at once, surrounded by many rākṣasas—Rāvaṇa, by the depth of
  his fierce spirit and majesty, seeming as though he would cleave the earth.
'35': >-
  And then there arose a mighty din, here and there, of instruments of music—of
  mṛdaṅgas, of paṭahas, of conches, and the tumultuous cries of the rākṣasas.
'36': >-
  “The king of the rākṣasas has come, attended with parasol and chowries—Sītā’s
  abductor, of evil conduct, slayer of brāhmaṇas, a thorn to the gods—he is come
  to fight with the foremost of the Raghu line!”—such was the clamorous sound
  that was heard.
'37': >-
  By that great roar the earth shook; and the monkeys, hearing that sound
  suddenly, ran in fear.
'38': >-
  But Rāvaṇa, mighty-armed, surrounded by his counsellors, of great radiance,
  advanced toward victory—toward conquest.
'39': >-
  Permitted by Rāvaṇa, Mahāpārśva and Mahodara, and Virūpākṣa too, hard to
  assail, then mounted their chariots.
'40': >-
  And they, joyfully roaring, as though splitting the earth, set forth—uttering
  a dreadful clamor—desirous of victory.
'41': >-
  Then, for battle, that radiant one went forth, surrounded by hosts of
  rākṣasas, bow uplifted—like Yama, the ender of Time.
'42': >-
  Then that great chariot-warrior, in his chariot with horses urged to speed,
  went out through that gate by which lay Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.
'43': >-
  Then the sun lost its brilliance, and the directions were covered in darkness;
  fierce birds did not cry out; and the earth trembled.
'44': >-
  The deity rained blood; the steeds stumbled; a vulture fell upon the top of
  the banner; and jackals cried inauspiciously.
'45': >-
  And his left eye twitched; his left arm quivered; his face became pale; and
  his voice faltered somewhat.
'46': >-
  Then, as the ten-necked rākṣasa rushed out to war, these omens appeared in the
  battle, foretelling his destruction.
'47': >-
  A meteor fell from the sky, resounding like a thunderclap; inauspicious
  vultures cried out, mingled with crows.
'48': >-
  Not pondering these dreadful portents that had manifested, Rāvaṇa, in delusion
  and driven on by Time, went forth for the sake of slaughter.
'49': >-
  And by the rumbling sound of the chariots of those great-souled rākṣasas, the
  army of monkeys too surged forward—indeed, for battle.
'50': >-
  And between them there arose a tumultuous battle of monkeys and rākṣasas—each
  challenging the other—enraged, seeking victory.
'51': >-
  Then the ten-headed one, wrathful, with arrows adorned with gold, wrought a
  mighty slaughter among the monkey battalions.
'52': >-
  Some monkey-faced warriors had their heads severed by Rāvaṇa; some had their
  hearts split; some were deprived of their ears.
'53': >-
  Some, their breath cut off, were slain; some were torn open at the flanks;
  some had their heads cleft; and some were bereft of their eyes.
'54': >-
  The ten-faced one, with eyes widened by anger, wherever he advanced in battle
  in his chariot—there and there the leaders of monkey-troops could not endure
  the rushing onslaught of his arrows.
'55': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-sixth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Arming and Going
  Forth of Rāvaṇa (Rāvaṇābhiṣeṇanam).”
