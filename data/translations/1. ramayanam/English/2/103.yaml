'0': >-
  Then, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-third sarga, named “The Meeting with the Mothers.”
'1': >-
  Placing Vasiṣṭha in front, and taking with them the wives of Daśaratha, they
  proceeded toward that place—eager and thirsting for a sight of Rāma.
'2': >-
  And the royal consorts, moving slowly on their way toward the Mandākinī,
  beheld there that sacred bathing-place—kept and tended by Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.
'3': >-
  Kauśalyā, miserable, her face filled with tears and drying with grief, spoke
  to Sumitrā and also to the other royal ladies.
'4': >-
  “This is the forest shrine—once a sacred place alone—now made the resort of
  those helpless ones, who though unwearied in righteous deeds are themselves
  worn down; for they have been stripped of all their worldly supports and joys.
'5': >-
  “From here, O Sumitrā, your son—the son of Sumitrā—ever vigilant, constantly
  fetches water with his own hands, and that too for the sake of my son (Rāma).”
'6': >-
  “Even the least act done by your son is not blameworthy; for whatever is to be
  done in service of his brother, he has accomplished all of it, guided by
  virtues.”
'7': >-
  “Even today, your son—one not fit for suffering—may he now give up this toil,
  this course of hardship and adversity, this difficult task to which he is
  devoted.”
'8': >-
  Then that large-eyed lady saw upon the ground, on the tips of kuśa-grass
  arranged with their ends to the south, a lump of iṅgudī-cake (the pressed
  residue of iṅgudī fruit) set down as food for his father.
'9': >-
  Seeing that iṅgudī-cake, set upon the earth by Rāma in anguish for his father,
  Queen Kauśalyā spoke—while all the wives of Daśaratha listened.
'10': >-
  “Behold this, placed here in due manner: this is what the great-souled
  Rāghava, lord of the Ikṣvākus, has given to his father.”
'11': >-
  “For that great king, godlike, I do not think this food is fitting—he who once
  enjoyed every delight and luxury.”
'12': >-
  “Having ruled and enjoyed the four-bounded earth, that sovereign, like
  Mahendra in splendor—how can that lord of the land partake of iṅgudī-cake?”
'13': >-
  “Nothing in this world appears to me more grievous than this—where Rāma gives
  to his father iṅgudī-paste, scant and devoid of richness.”
'14': >-
  “When I behold that iṅgudī-cake given by Rāma to his father, how does my heart
  not burst into a thousand fragments from sorrow?”
'15': >-
  “Yet this saying is indeed true; it appears to me a worldly truth: ‘Whatever a
  man’s food is, such indeed are his deities’—the gods depend upon the food that
  is offered.”
'16': >-
  Thus, the co-wives consoled her who was distressed, and then they went on; and
  they beheld Rāma in the hermitage—like a god fallen from heaven.
'17': >-
  Seeing Rāma, bereft of all enjoyments, the mothers—tormented, worn by
  grief—let their tears flow aloud, with voices choked by sorrow.
'18': >-
  Rāma rose and clasped the auspicious feet of all those mothers—the tiger among
  men, steadfast in truth and firm in his vows.
'19': >-
  With their hands—soft to the touch, with gentle palms and fair fingers—those
  large-eyed ladies tenderly wiped away the dust from Rāma’s back.
'20': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa also, seeing all those mothers and feeling sorrow, bowed to them
  devotedly—slowly, after Rāma.
'21': >-
  And just as they were disposed toward Rāma, so were all the ladies disposed
  toward him too—toward Lakṣmaṇa, born of Daśaratha, auspiciously marked.
'22': >-
  Sītā also, grieving, took hold of the feet of those mothers; and with eyes
  filled with tears before her mothers-in-law, she stood there in front.
'23': >-
  Embracing her in sorrow, like a mother her own daughter, Kauśalyā spoke to the
  pitiable Sītā, made thin by life in the forest.
'24': >-
  “Daughter of the king of Videha, daughter-in-law of Daśaratha, wife of
  Rāma—how have you come to such suffering in the lonely forest?”
'25': >-
  “Like a lotus scorched by the sun, like a water-lily as though distressed;
  like gold tarnished by dust; like the moon obscured and troubled by clouds—”
'26': >-
  “Seeing your face, O Vaidehī, grief burns me intensely, like fire consuming
  its fuel; within my mind it blazes forth, born of the fire-drill of calamity.”
'27': >-
  While his mother thus spoke in distress, Rāghava—the elder brother of
  Bharata—approached and clasped the feet of Vasiṣṭha as well.
'28': >-
  Then, having taken hold of the feet of that illustrious, fire-like family
  priest—like Indra, lord of the immortals, taking hold of Bṛhaspati’s
  feet—Rāghava sat down together with him.
'29': >-
  Thereupon Bharata—the righteous one, best knower of dharma—came and sat near
  his elder brother, along with ministers of foremost rank, chief citizens, and
  soldiers, and with the people as well.
'30': >-
  And Bharata, seated thus, beheld Rāghava in the guise of an ascetic—radiant
  with splendor—and with joined palms, he sat in reverence, as Mahendra (Indra)
  in humility before Prajāpati.
'31': >-
  “What words will Bharata today speak to Rāghava, after bowing and honoring him
  well?”—thus, among the noble people there arose at that time a deep and
  excellent curiosity.
'32': >-
  Rāghava, steadfastly upheld by truth, and Lakṣmaṇa of great prowess, and
  Bharata righteous in conduct—surrounded by their well-wishers—shone like the
  three sacred fires in a sacrifice, accompanied by the assembled officiants.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-third sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the
  venerable, holy Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first epic, entitled “The
  Meeting with the Mothers.”
