  Now begins, in the illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the
  second sarga, entitled “The Confrontation with Virādha.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, having duly honoured his guests, and having taken leave of all
  those sages, set forth into the forest, proceeding in the direction of the
  sun’s rising.
'2': >-
  He entered a woodland filled with herds of many kinds of deer, frequented by
  bears and tigers, with trees, creepers, and thickets broken and trampled down,
  and with pools of water that were hard to discern.
'3': >-
  Rāma, followed by Lakṣmaṇa, beheld the heart of that forest—resounding with
  the cries of birds and echoed by the humming chorus of crickets.
'4': >-
  There, the Kakutstha, together with Sītā, saw a man-eater of dreadful aspect
  amid the presence of terrible beasts—huge-voiced, and resembling a
  mountain-peak in form.
'5': >-
  He was deep-eyed, huge-mouthed, monstrous, with a vast and misshapen
  belly—ghastly, uneven-limbed, tall, deformed, and terrible to behold.
'6': >-
  He wore a tiger-skin garment, smeared with fat and drenched in blood; a terror
  to all creatures, with gaping mouth—like Death himself with jaws outspread.
'7': >-
  Three lions and four tigers, two wolves, and ten spotted deer, and moreover
  the great head of an elephant with tusks—smeared with fat and gore—
'8': >-
  all these he had impaled and hung upon an iron spear; and roaring loudly he
  stood. Seeing Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and Sītā the princess of Mithilā,
'9': >-
  he rushed upon them in furious rage, like Time the destroyer approaching
  living beings; and, uttering a dreadful roar, he seemed to shake the very
  earth.
'10': >-
  Rāma then, taking the princess of Videha upon his lap and withdrawing a
  little, spoke these words (to that rākṣasa): “You two, wearing matted locks
  and bark-garments, together with your wife, are of diminished life and near to
  death.
'11': >-
  You have entered the Daṇḍaka forest bearing arrows, bow, and sword in your
  hands. How is it that you, who appear to be ascetics, dwell here together with
  a woman?
'12': >-
  Who are you two—sinful and following unrighteous conduct—defilers of sages? I
  am the rākṣasa named Virādha, and this is my dreadful forest.
'13': >-
  I ever roam about armed, devouring the flesh of ṛṣis. This woman of lovely
  limbs shall become my wife.
'14': >-
  And I, in battle, shall drink the blood of you two wicked ones.” While the
  vile and evil-souled Virādha spoke thus,
'15': >-
  Sītā, the daughter of Janaka, hearing his arrogant speech, was struck with
  fear; and trembling in agitation, she quivered like a plantain-tree in the
  wind.
'16': >-
  Seeing that auspicious Sītā borne upon Virādha’s lap, Rāghava spoke to
  Lakṣmaṇa; and his mouth was parched (with grief and wrath).
'17': >-
  “Behold, Saumya, Janaka’s daughter, born of the king of men—my wife of pure
  conduct—has been seized and set upon Virādha’s lap.
'18': >-
  She was reared in utmost happiness, a glorious princess; and she is what was
  cherished and desired by us, and what was lovingly chosen (as my bride).
'19': >-
  O Lakṣmaṇa, today—this very day—has quickly come to pass the fulfilment of
  Kaikeyī’s desire, she who, far-sighted in pursuit of her son’s aim, is not
  satisfied even by a kingdom.
'20': >-
  She through whom I, dear to all beings, was sent forth to the forest—today,
  now, that my middle mother’s wish is accomplished.
'21': >-
  For me there is no sorrow more painful than the touch of the Vaidehī by
  another—no, not even the destruction of my father, O Saumitri, nor likewise
  the taking away of my own kingdom.
'22': >-
  As the Kakutstha spoke thus, overwhelmed by tears and grief, Lakṣmaṇa,
  enraged, replied—breathing hard like a confined elephant.
'23': >-
  “Though you are, as it were, the lord and protector of beings, you stand like
  one without a protector; you are like Vāsava (Indra) himself. O Kakutstha, why
  do you grieve thus, when I am here as your servant?
'24': >-
  “Today, by me in anger, this rākṣasa, when struck down with an arrow—once
  Virādha’s life has departed—shall make the earth drink his blood.
'25': >-
  “That wrath of mine which once arose against Bharata because of desire for the
  kingdom—I shall release it upon Virādha, as the wielder of the thunderbolt
  hurls the thunderbolt upon a mountain.
'26': >-
  “Driven on by the speed of the strength of my arms, let my great arrow fall
  upon his broad chest; let it take away the life from his body, and
  then—reeling and whirling—let him collapse upon the earth.”
'27': >-
  Thus ends the second sarga, entitled “The Confrontation with Virādha,” in the
  Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
