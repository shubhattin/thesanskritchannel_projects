  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-ninth sarga, entitled “Śrī Rāma’s Great Departure
  (Mahāprasthāna).”
'1': >-
  Then, when the night had dawned into morning, the broad-chested, greatly
  renowned Rāma—lotus-petalled of eyes—spoke to the royal priest.
'2': >-
  “Let the Agnihotra go foremost, blazing, together with the twice-born
  brāhmaṇas; and let the Vājapeya ceremonial pavilion also proceed, splendid,
  upon the great highway.”
'3': >-
  Thereupon the radiant Vasiṣṭha, leaving nothing undone, performed in due form
  the entire rite of dharma—the great ceremonial ordinance pertaining to the
  royal departure.
'4': >-
  Then, clad in fine garments, and reciting the supreme Brahman, taking
  kuśa-grass in both hands, he set forth on that sacred journey.
'5': >-
  Speaking nothing at any place, motionless and devoid of all personal ease
  along the way, he went forth from that house, blazing like the Sun.
'6': >-
  On Rāma’s right side stood Śrī (Fortune), accompanied by the lotus, close by
  him; on his left was the great goddess Hrī (Modesty); and in front went
  Vyavasāya (Steadfast Resolve).
'7': >-
  Arrows of many kinds, and the excellent bow of great length, and likewise all
  his weapons—every one of them—went along in embodied, personified form.
'8': >-
  The Vedas, in the form of brāhmaṇas; Gāyatrī, the protectress of all; and also
  Oṃkāra and Vaṣaṭkāra—all followed after Rāma, devoted to him.
'9': >-
  And the great-souled ṛṣis, and all the kings upon the earth, followed that
  great-souled one, for whom the gateway of heaven stood opened.
'10': >-
  As he proceeded, the women of the inner apartments followed after him—the
  maidservants together with the aged and the children, and attendants and
  servants of every excellent sort.
'11': >-
  And Bharata, together with Śatrughna and the entire royal household, went
  forth—having attained to Rāma’s very course—following him, with the sacred
  Agnihotra preceding.
'12': >-
  And all those great-souled ones assembled there, accompanied by the Agnihotra,
  with their sons and wives, followed Kakutstha (Rāma), the high-minded.
'13': >-
  Ministers and ranks of servants as well, together with their sons, cattle, and
  kinsmen—all, with their followers, went after Rāma, as though filled with
  gladness.
'14': >-
  Then all the subjects, delighted, encompassed by thriving and well-nourished
  people, followed that Rāghava as he went—charmed and drawn by his virtues.
'15': >-
  Then all those followers—women and men alike, together with birds, beasts, and
  vehicles—attended upon Rāghava, joyful and free from sin and taint.
'16': >-
  All the vānaras too, having bathed, were delighted—joyful and flourishing;
  with firm, loud cries of “kilakilā,” the entire host followed after Rāma.
'17': >-
  There was none there who was wretched, or ashamed, or sorrowing; the whole
  multitude became joyous and uplifted—most wondrous to behold.
'18': >-
  And the people of the countryside, desiring to see Rāma as he went
  forth—whoever came and beheld him—upon that very sight followed him gladly
  toward heaven.
'19': >-
  Bears, vānaras, and rākṣasas, and the citizens dwelling in the city, came with
  supreme devotion, following behind him with minds well-composed.
'20': >-
  Whatever beings there were in the city—even those that had taken to
  invisibility—followed after Rāghava, who stood ready for ascent to heaven.
'21': >-
  And whatever beings, stationary or moving, that beheld Kakutstha—those too,
  all of them, in Rāma’s going forth, indeed followed along with him.
'22': >-
  In Ayodhyā, even the subtlest breath seemed not to remain; even those born in
  animal and lower wombs—all became followers of Rāma.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-ninth sarga of the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “Śrī Rāma’s Great Departure
  (Mahāprasthāna).”
