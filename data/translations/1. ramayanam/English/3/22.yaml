  Now begins the twenty-second canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “Khara’s Mustering for Battle.”
'1': >-
  Thus assailed by Śūrpaṇakhā, the valiant Khara thereupon spoke, in the midst
  of the rākṣasas, words yet more fierce and harsh.
'2': >-
  From the insult done to you, an incomparable wrath has arisen in me; it cannot
  be held back—like the surging, violent waters of the salt ocean.
'3': >-
  I do not reckon Rāma as mighty—a mere man, with his span of life
  diminished—who, by his own wicked deeds, shall today be slain and released of
  his very breath.
'4': >-
  Let these tears be restrained, and let agitation be cast away. I shall send
  Rāma, together with his brother, to the abode of Yama.
'5': >-
  When today Rāma lies on the earth, struck by the axe, his life-breaths ebbing
  and faint, you, O rākṣasī, shall drink his hot, red blood.
'6': >-
  Hearing these words that fell from Khara’s mouth, Śūrpaṇakhā, delighted, once
  more—in her folly—praised her brother, the foremost among rākṣasas.
'7': >-
  Having first been harshly spoken to by her, and then praised again, Khara then
  addressed Duṣaṇa, his commander of the host.
'8': >-
  Fourteen thousand rākṣasas of mine, who follow my will—of terrible impetuosity
  and never retreating in battle—
'9': >-
  dark as rain-clouds, delighting in the injury of the world, and all with their
  energies fully roused—make them ready, O good one.
'10': >-
  Make ready for me swiftly a chariot, O good one, and bows as well; and
  variegated arrows, and swords, and diverse sharp spears.
'11': >-
  I desire to go forth at the head of those great-souled descendants of
  Pulastya, to slay the ill-disciplined Rāma—O you who are skilled in war.
'12': >-
  While he was thus speaking, Duṣaṇa pointed out a great chariot, radiant as the
  sun, yoked with excellent, dappled horses.
'13': >-
  It was like the peak of Mount Meru, adorned with ornaments of heated gold;
  with golden wheels that were not cramped or obstructed, and with a yoke
  fashioned of vaidūrya gems.
'14': >-
  It was embellished with auspicious golden figures—fish, flowers, trees,
  mountains, the moon and the sun—and with flocks of birds and with stars all
  around.
'15': >-
  Furnished with banners and swords, richly adorned with fine tinkling bells,
  and yoked with excellent horses—Khara then mounted it in wrath.
'16': >-
  Then, beholding all the rākṣasas, Duṣaṇa said: “Let that great army—bearing
  chariots, leather armor, weapons, and banners—march forth!”
'17': >-
  Thereupon that rākṣasa host, with dreadful leather armor, weapons, and
  standards, issued forth from Jana-sthāna, with a great roar and mighty speed.
'18': >-
  With maces, battle-axes, tridents, and exceedingly sharp axes; with swords and
  discus weapons held in their hands, blazing, and with javelins—
'19': >-
  with spears, with dreadful iron bars, with exceedingly large bows; with clubs,
  swords, mallets, and thunderbolt-like weapons—grasped by those terrible to
  behold—
'20': >-
  fourteen thousand of those exceedingly dreadful rākṣasas, who followed Khara’s
  mind, marched out from Jana-sthāna.
'21': >-
  Seeing those terrible-looking rākṣasas rushing forth, Khara’s chariot too
  moved forward a little thereafter.
'22': >-
  Then, understanding Khara’s intention, the charioteer urged on those dappled
  horses adorned with heated gold.
'23': >-
  Thus urged, the chariot of Khara—the slayer of foes—sped swiftly, and with its
  sound filled the quarters and the intermediate directions as well.
'24': >-
  Khara, his fury grown, of harsh voice, hastened to slay his enemy like Death
  himself; and he again drove on the charioteer, roaring—great in strength, like
  a thundercloud raining down hailstones.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-second canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “Khara’s Mustering for Battle.”
