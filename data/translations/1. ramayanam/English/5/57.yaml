  Now begins the fifty-seventh canto of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Return of Hanumān.”
'1': >-
  Then Hanumān, of mighty speed, sprang forth—like a winged mountain—upon the
  ocean of the sky, which seemed strewn with awakened lotuses and water-lilies,
  and with serpents, Yakṣas, and Gandharvas (as though inhabiting that airy
  expanse).
'2': >-
  That sky-ocean appeared charming and auspicious: with the moon like a
  kumuda-lily; with the sun like a kāraṇḍava-bird; with the constellation Tiṣya
  like a splendid flock of śravaṇaka-birds; with the constellation Śravaṇa like
  kādamba-trees; and with clouds like masses of duckweed and green sward.
'3': >-
  There were the great fishes of the constellation Pūrvavasu, the red-bodied
  “great seizer” (Rāhu) as a mighty aquatic creature; the great “island” of
  Airāvata; and the constellation Svātī, sporting like swans—all as though
  adorning that celestial ocean.
'4': >-
  That ocean of the sky possessed waters made cool by the moonbeams and by the
  gust-driven net of waves; and Hanumān, unwearied, leapt across it.
'5': >-
  He seemed as if devouring the very firmament, as if scraping the Lord of the
  stars (the moon), and as if carrying off the sky together with its
  constellations and the disk of the sun.
'6': >-
  Boundless and unexhausted, Hanumān traversed the sea; and as he went, it was
  as though he were dragging along clusters of clouds.
'7': >-
  Great clouds shone forth—some pale and ruddy, some dark blue and madder-hued,
  and others greenish and reddish in tint.
'8': >-
  Entering the masses of clouds and emerging again and again, he appeared
  alternately bright and obscured, like the moon.
'9': >-
  Moving amid dense and varied cloud-banks, that hero in white radiance became
  now visible and now invisible; thus in the heavens he seemed like the moon
  itself.
'10': >-
  Like Garuḍa coursing through the sky, the Son of the Wind appeared, repeatedly
  bursting through clusters of clouds and shooting out again and again.
'11': >-
  Roaring with a mighty roar, thunderous like the rumble of clouds—having slain
  the foremost rākṣasas and having made his own name renowned—he sped onward.
'12': >-
  Having thrown the city into tumult, having tormented Rāvaṇa, having crushed
  great warriors, and having paid reverence to Vaidehī, he came away.
'13': >-
  The mighty, radiant one returned across the middle of the ocean; and, full of
  valor, he touched upon the lordly mountain Su-nābha.
'14': >-
  Like an arrow released from the bow-string, of tremendous speed, he drew near;
  and having come somewhat close, he beheld the great mountain (Mahendra).
'15': >-
  Seeing Mahendra, cloud-like in appearance, the great monkey gave a roar; and
  that kapi filled the ten directions on every side.
'16': >-
  Roaring again with that great roar, thunderous like the sound of clouds, he
  reached that region, eager for the sight of his friends.
'17': >-
  He sent forth a very mighty cry, and he also shook his tail; and as he roared
  on that path trodden by Suparṇa (Garuḍa),
'18': >-
  the sky with the circle of the sun seemed as though it would burst asunder by
  the force of his shout. Those mighty ones who were on the northern shore of
  the sea—
'19': >-
  the heroes who had earlier taken their seats there, longing to see the Son of
  the Wind—heard then Hanumān’s mighty, swift shout, like the resounding of a
  water-laden cloud driven by a strong wind.
'20': >-
  All those forest-dwellers, their minds downcast, heard the vanara-king’s
  thunderous proclamation, comparable to the roar of rain-clouds.
'21': >-
  Hearing the sound of his roaring, the vanaras on all sides became eager, all
  desiring the sight of their dear friend.
'22': >-
  Jāmbavān, that best of monkeys, his heart thrilled with joy, addressed all the
  monkeys in counsel and spoke these words:
'23': >-
  “In every way he has accomplished the task—Hanumān; of this there is no doubt.
  For one who has not accomplished his work would not utter such a cry as this.”
'24': >-
  Hearing the speed and force of his arms and thighs, and the great roar of that
  high-souled one, the monkeys, delighted, sprang up from where they were.
'25': >-
  Rejoicing, they hastened from peak to peak and from summit to summit, eager to
  behold Hanumān.
'26': >-
  Delighted, the vanaras stood upon the tops of trees, grasping the branches;
  and they waved bright garments in welcome.
'27': >-
  As the wind roars when confined within a mountain cave, even so the powerful
  Hanumān, Son of Māruta, thundered.
'28': >-
  Beholding that great monkey, like a dense mass of cloud, coming swiftly toward
  them, all the vanaras then stood with joined palms.
'29': >-
  Then that swift hero—the kapi resembling a mountain—alighted upon the summit
  of that mountain, amid thick growth of trees.
'30': >-
  Filled to overflowing with joy on that lovely mountain-stream-bedecked height,
  he fell down like a mountain whose wings have been cut, dropping from the sky.
'31': >-
  Then all the foremost of the vanaras, their minds gladdened, surrounded the
  great-souled Hanumān and attended upon him.
'32': >-
  Having surrounded him, they all attained supreme joy; with delighted faces
  they all approached him who had returned.
'33': >-
  Bringing offerings—roots and fruits—they honored the best of monkeys, Māruta’s
  son.
'34': >-
  Some cried out with gladness; some made shrill kīla-kīla sounds; and,
  rejoicing, the bulls among vanaras brought also branches of trees.
'35': >-
  But Hanumān, that great monkey, bowed to the elders and venerable ones, headed
  by Jāmbavān, and also to the prince Aṅgada.
'36': >-
  Honored by those two worthy of honor, and received graciously by the monkeys,
  the valiant Hanumān reported succinctly: “The goddess has been seen.”
'37': >-
  And taking Vālin’s son (Aṅgada) by the hand, he sat down then in a delightful
  grove-region upon Mount Mahendra.
'38': >-
  When questioned, Hanumān spoke then to those bull-like vanaras: “The daughter
  of Janaka was seen, abiding in the Aśoka-grove.”
'39': >-
  “She is guarded by exceedingly dreadful rākṣasīs, blameless; a young woman,
  wearing her hair in a single braid, longing for the sight of Rāma.”
'40': >-
  “Worn out by fasting, unclean and soiled, matted-haired, and emaciated—thus
  she was seen.” That statement, of great import, was like nectar.
'41': >-
  Hearing the words of Hanumān, all the vanaras became joyful. Some shouted;
  some roared; some bellowed mightily, those of great strength.
'42': >-
  Some made shrill cries, and others answered with counter-roars. Some great
  apes, delighted, lifted their tails aloft.
'43': >-
  Others vigorously brandished their long, curved, extended tails; and some,
  rejoicing, sprang up onto mountain peaks and touched them.
'44': >-
  Then Aṅgada spoke to Hanumān, that illustrious best of vanaras, whose words
  had thus been spoken, in the midst of all the heroic monkeys—words
  unsurpassed:
'45': “In courage and in valor there is none among the vanaras equal to you.”
'46': >-
  “For, having leapt over the vast ocean, you have returned again. You alone, O
  best of vanaras, are the giver of our lives.”
'47': >-
  “By your grace we shall meet Rāghava with our purpose accomplished. Ah, your
  devotion to your lord! Ah, your valor! Ah, your steadfastness!”
'48': >-
  “Fortunate indeed that the illustrious goddess, Rāma’s wife, has been seen by
  you. Fortunate indeed that the Kakutstha will abandon the sorrow born of
  separation from Sītā.”
'49': >-
  Then the vanaras, delighted, surrounded Aṅgada, Hanumān, and Jāmbavān, and
  took their places upon broad rocks.
'50': >-
  Seated upon those broad slabs on that mountain, those best of vanaras wished
  to hear of the crossing of the ocean,
'51': >-
  and also of the sight of Laṅkā, of Sītā, and of Rāvaṇa. All stood with joined
  palms, their faces turned toward Hanumān.
'52': >-
  There stood the illustrious Aṅgada, surrounded by many vanaras, attended
  upon—like the lord of the gods in heaven, worshiped by the immortals.
'53': >-
  That lofty, vast mountain-summit, occupied then with joy by Hanumān—renowned
  and glorious—and by Aṅgada, whose arms were adorned with armlets, became
  resplendent with splendor.
'54': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-seventh canto of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Return of Hanumān.”
