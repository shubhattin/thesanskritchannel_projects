'0': >-
  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins
  the one-hundred-and-sixth sarga, entitled “The Abandonment of Lakṣmaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, beholding Rāghava with face cast down, despondent, and as it
  were submerged like the moon covered over (by eclipse or cloud), spoke to him,
  himself composed and even gladdened, these gentle and sweet words:
'2': >-
  “O mighty-armed one, thou shouldst not grieve on my account. For such is the
  course of Time—its movement is thus, bound by what was fashioned afore (by
  destiny and prior ordainment).”
'3': >-
  “Slay me, O gentle one, with thy mind at ease; fulfil thy vow. For men, O
  scion of Kakutstha, who are wanting in their pledged word, go to hell.”
'4': >-
  “If there is affection, O great king, if there is any favour to be shown unto
  me, then, without hesitation, slay me; uphold and increase dharma, O Rāghava.”
'5': >-
  Thus addressed by Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma—his senses shaken (by anguish)—summoned his
  ministers, and likewise his family priest.
'6': >-
  And then, in their midst, that Rāghava related the matter as it had
  occurred—how Durvāsas had come, and the ascetic’s vow (and the vow taken in
  regard to it).
'7': >-
  Hearing that, all the ministers together with the preceptor sat assembled; but
  Vasiṣṭha, of great splendour, spoke these words:
'8': >-
  “This has been foreseen, O mighty-armed one—this dreadful end that causes the
  hair to stand on end: separation from Lakṣmaṇa for thee, O Rāma of great
  renown.”
'9': >-
  “Abandon him; Time is mighty. Do not render thy vow vain. When a vow is
  destroyed, dharma too would fall into ruin.”
'10': >-
  “And when dharma is ruined, the three worlds—moving and unmoving—together with
  the gods and all the hosts of ṛṣis, would perish; of this there is no doubt.”
'11': >-
  “Therefore, O tiger among men, for the protection of the three worlds, even
  without Lakṣmaṇa today, do thou secure the welfare of the universe.”
'12': >-
  Hearing, in the midst of that council, their speech—fraught with dharma and
  with true expediency (artha)—Rāma said to Lakṣmaṇa:
'13': >-
  “I release thee, O Saumitre; let there be no overturning of dharma. For the
  good, abandonment and slaying are both enjoined; and for them both are
  regarded as the same (in effect).”
'14': >-
  When these words were spoken by Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa—his senses overwhelmed with
  tears—departed in haste; he went to his own dwelling, yet did not enter it.
'15': >-
  Having gone to the bank of the Sarayū, he sipped water in purification and,
  with hands joined in reverence, restraining all the channels of the breath, he
  did not let forth an exhalation.
'16': >-
  Then all the gods with the assemblage of ṛṣis, together with Śakra (Indra) and
  the hosts of apsarases, showered him with flowers—him who was thus joined in
  yoga, not breathing.
'17': >-
  Taking up mighty Lakṣmaṇa—become invisible to all his younger brothers (and to
  men), and still with his very body—Śakra entered Tri-diva, heaven.
'18': >-
  Then the best of the gods, beholding that fourth portion of Viṣṇu returned
  (unto its divine source), all became joyful and, together with the great ṛṣis,
  worshipped him with delight.
'19': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-sixth sarga of the Uttarakāṇḍa of the holy and
  illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Abandonment of
  Lakṣmaṇa.”
