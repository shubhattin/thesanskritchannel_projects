  Now begins the eighty-first canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Curse upon Daṇḍa.”
'1': >-
  Hearing of it after a short while, that divine seer of immeasurable splendour,
  Uśanas, returned to his own hermitage, surrounded by his disciples, and
  afflicted with hunger.
'2': >-
  He beheld Arājā—wretched—covered over with dust, like moonlight seized by a
  planet, not shining forth at dawn.
'3': >-
  Then wrath arose in him—especially because he was tormented by hunger—as
  though he would burn up the three worlds; and he spoke these words to his
  disciples:
'4': >-
  “Behold the dreadful calamity of Daṇḍa, whose self is unconquered and whose
  conduct has turned contrary to righteousness—like a blazing tongue of fire
  when it is enraged.”
'5': >-
  “Destruction has come upon that evil-minded, wicked-souled man together with
  his followers—he who wishes to touch the flame, blazing, of the sacrificial
  fire.”
'6': >-
  “Since he has committed a sin of such a kind, attended by terrible
  consequences, therefore that dull-witted man shall obtain the fruit of his
  sinful deed.”
'7': >-
  “Within seven nights that king—together with his servants, his army, and his
  mounts and vehicles—given over to sinful conduct, shall meet with death, the
  evil-minded one.”
'8': >-
  “And all around, for a hundred yojanas, the entire realm of that wicked-minded
  man shall be consumed by mighty Pākāśāsana (Indra) through a great rain of
  dust.”
'9': >-
  “All beings that are here—whether immovable or moving—shall, on every side, go
  to destruction by that great rain of dust.”
'10': >-
  “As far as the domain of Daṇḍa extends—altogether—the rain of dust, invisible
  to the eye like a veiling storm, shall continue for seven nights.”
'11': >-
  Having spoken thus, his eyes reddened with anger, he also said to the people
  dwelling in that hermitage, “Let everyone remain at the outskirts of the
  country.”
'12': >-
  Hearing the words of Uśanas, the people who dwelt in the hermitage went forth
  from that region and made their settlement outside it.
'13': >-
  Then, after so speaking to the sages, he addressed Arājā and said this: “Here
  itself, O misguided woman, remain in the hermitage, well composed.”
'14': >-
  “Here is a lake extending for a yojana, of exceedingly lovely radiance. O
  Arājā, free from sickness, partake of it (for your sustenance), and let the
  time be awaited here.”
'15': >-
  “And whatever creatures come to dwell near you during that night—those shall
  forever be inviolable to the rain of dust.”
'16': >-
  Hearing the ordinance of the brahmarṣi, that Bhārgavī, Arājā, then, deeply
  sorrowful, said to her father Bhārgava, “So be it.” Having thus spoken,
  Bhārgava made his dwelling elsewhere.
'17': >-
  And that kingdom of the lord of men—together with his servants, his army, and
  his mounts and vehicles—became ashes within a week, just as had been spoken by
  the knower of Brahman.
'18': >-
  Thus that realm of Daṇḍa, O king, between the Vindhya and the Śaivala
  mountains, was cursed by that brahmarṣi because an act contrary to dharma had
  been done.
'19': >-
  From that time onward, O scion of the Kakutsthas, it has been called the
  Daṇḍaka forest. Ascetics indeed took their stand here; hence it came to be
  known as Jana-sthāna (the ‘abode of people’).
'20': >-
  “All this has been related to you, O Rāghava, which you asked me. O hero, the
  time for worshipping the twilight is passing by.”
'21': >-
  “All these great seers, standing all around with their water-pots filled, O
  tiger among men, are performing worship to the Sun after making the
  water-offering.”
'22': >-
  “Rāma, as the Sun has set, you too—having practised the rites taught by the
  Brāhmaṇas, in the company of these foremost knowers of Brahman—go and touch
  water (perform ācamana and the prescribed purification).”
'23': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-first canto, called “The Curse upon Daṇḍa,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
