  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa,
  begins the fifty-seventh canto, named “The Account of Jaṭāyu’s Final Tidings.”

  Hearing those words—even though his voice was broken by grief—the leaders of
  the monkey-bands did not place faith in that speech, suspecting him because of
  his deeds.
'2': >-
  Then those monkeys, who had seated themselves to fast unto death, seeing the
  vulture, conceived a fierce resolve: “He will devour us all.”
'3': >-
  “If in any case he will devour us while we sit here fasting unto death, then
  we shall have accomplished our purpose; swiftly shall we attain our end by
  departing from here.”
'4': >-
  Having thus formed this resolve, all those leaders of the monkey-host, after
  making the vulture descend from the peak of the mountain, Aṅgada then spoke to
  him.
'5': >-
  “There was a mighty lord of monkeys named Ṛkṣarajas, full of prowess. O bird,
  he was my noble father; and his two sons were righteous.”
'6': >-
  “Sugrīva and Vālī were those two sons, both endowed with great strength. My
  father, King Vālī, was renowned in the world for his deeds.”
'7': >-
  “Rāma, the illustrious son of Daśaratha, a great warrior of the Ikṣvāku race,
  the king—indeed as it were of the whole world—entered the Daṇḍaka forest.”
'8': >-
  “With his brother Lakṣmaṇa, and with his wife Vaidehī, devoted to his father’s
  command, he followed the path of dharma.”
'9': >-
  “From Janasthāna his wife was forcibly carried off by Rāvaṇa. Jaṭāyu by name,
  the king of vultures, was a friend of Rāma’s father.”
'10': >-
  “He saw Vaidehī Sītā being borne away through the sky. Having made Rāvaṇa
  bereft of his chariot and having set Maithilī down, being wearied and aged, he
  was slain by Rāvaṇa in battle.”
'11': >-
  “Thus that vulture was killed by the more powerful Rāvaṇa; and Rāma, having
  performed his obsequies, sent him on to the highest state.”
'12': >-
  “Thereafter, with my uncle Sugrīva, the great-souled one, Rāghava made
  friendship; and he slew my father.”
'13': >-
  “For Sugrīva, together with his counsellors, had been restrained by my father;
  then Rāma, having slain Vālin, consecrated Sugrīva.”
'14': >-
  “Established in the kingdom by him, Sugrīva became lord of the monkeys; and we
  were dispatched by him—the king of the foremost among the monkeys.”
'15': >-
  “Thus commissioned by Rāma, searching here and there, we do not find
  Vaidehī—like the sun’s radiance by night.”
'16': >-
  “We, well intent, having searched the Daṇḍaka forest, through ignorance
  entered a cavern opened in the earth.”
'17': >-
  “While we were seeking, a full month passed for us in that cave contrived by
  the magic of Maya—exceeding the time fixed by the king.”
'18': >-
  “We all, obedient to the words of the king of monkeys, have overstepped the
  appointed term; and, out of fear, have resorted to fasting unto death.”
'19': >-
  “For when that scion of Kakutstha is angered—and Sugrīva too, with
  Lakṣmaṇa—then for us, even should we go there, there will be no life
  remaining.”
'20': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-seventh canto, named “The Account of Jaṭāyu’s Final
  Tidings,” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the holy primeval
  epic.
