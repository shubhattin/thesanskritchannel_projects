  Now, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the Bala-Kanda, begins the fifty-ninth
  sarga, called “The Curse concerning Vasistha.”
'1': >-
  When the king had thus spoken, the son of Kushika, moved by compassion,
  addressed him in gentle and gracious words—though the king had, as it were,
  come to the state of a very Chandala (an outcaste) before their eyes.
'2': >-
  “O scion of Ikshvaku, welcome, dear child. I know you to be truly righteous
  and devoted to dharma. I shall grant you refuge; fear not, O bull among
  kings.”
'3': >-
  “I shall summon all the great rishis of holy deeds, O king, who will assist in
  the sacrifice; and then you shall perform the yajna in peace and gladness.”
'4': >-
  “The form that has come upon you, wrought by the curse of your guru, shall
  indeed remain upon you; with that very form, and with your body still intact,
  you shall attain your goal.”
'5': >-
  “I deem heaven to be already within your grasp, O lord of men, for you have
  approached Kaushika (myself) and come as one seeking refuge to him who is a
  refuge—having surrendered yourself.”
'6': >-
  Having spoken thus, the mighty-splendoured sage then commanded his
  sons—supremely righteous and of great wisdom—to make ready the requisites for
  the sacrifice.
'7': >-
  Summoning all his disciples together, he spoke these words: “By my command,
  bring here all the rishis, together with Vasistha and his following.”
'8': >-
  “Bring also their disciples and friends, and the officiating priests—men
  deeply learned in sacred lore. And if any should speak otherwise, let them be
  constrained by the force of my word.”
'9': >-
  This entire instruction, in full and without omission, was conveyed as it was
  to be announced, and was not disregarded. Hearing that command, they set out
  at once in obedience, departing to the several quarters.
'10': >-
  Then from every region the brahmavādins (speakers of Brahman, expounders of
  the Veda) arrived. Those disciples too, returning, assembled around the sage
  whose splendour blazed like fire.
'11': >-
  And they reported the whole matter—the message of all those brahmavādins:
  “Having heard your word, all the twice-born are indeed coming hither.”
'12': >-
  From all lands they came—excepting Mahodaya alone. As for Vasistha, all that
  was said by him came clothed in syllables agitated by wrath.
'13': >-
  “Hear, O best of sages, exactly what he said in full: ‘A kshatriya is to serve
  as sacrificer-priest—especially for a Chandala!’”
'14': >-
  “‘How in the sacrificial assembly could the deva-rishis partake of his
  oblations? Or how could great-souled brahmanas eat, after having eaten
  Chandala-food?’”
'15': >-
  “‘And how will they go to heaven, being supported by Vishvamitra?’” Such harsh
  and cutting words they uttered, their eyes reddened with anger.
'16': >-
  All those Vasisthas—O tiger among sages—together with Mahodaya: hearing the
  words spoken by them all, the best of ascetics,
'17': >-
  with eyes inflamed by wrath, spoke these words in indignation: “Since they
  revile me though I am without fault and established in austere tapas,
'18': >-
  those evil-souled men shall be reduced to ashes—of this there is no doubt.
  Today, bound by the noose of Time, they are carried to the abode of Vaivasvata
  (Yama).”
'19': >-
  “Let them become, for seven hundred births, drinkers of the dead (feeding on
  corpses), living on a fixed diet of dog’s flesh—cruel beings known as
  Mushtikas.”
'20': >-
  “Deformed and misshapen, let them wander about these worlds. And Mahodaya
  too—of perverted understanding—since he has sought to defame me who is not to
  be defamed,
'21': >-
  shall become a Nishada, disgraced in all worlds—one devoted to taking life and
  fallen into pitilessness.”
'22': >-
  “For a long time, by reason of my wrath, he shall dwell in a state of evil
  plight and misery.” Having spoken words only so far, Vishvamitra of great
  austerity—of mighty splendour, the great sage—fell silent in the midst of the
  rishis.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-ninth sarga of the Bala-Kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Adi-Kavya, entitled “The Curse concerning Vasistha.”
