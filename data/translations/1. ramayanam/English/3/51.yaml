  Now begins, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the
  Fifty-first Sarga, entitled “The Battle between Jaṭāyu and Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed, the lord of the rākṣasas—his eyes reddened with wrath, his
  golden earrings glowing as if heated—rushed straight at the king of birds,
  unable to endure the affront.
'2': >-
  In that great encounter, the clash between the two became tumultuous—like two
  clouds, driven by the wind, colliding in the sky.
'3': >-
  Then that combat became wondrous indeed—the battle of the vulture and the
  rākṣasa—like two lofty mountains, winged as it were, confronting one another.
'4': >-
  Thereupon, with long-shafted arrows, with razor-pointed and barbed shafts, he
  showered upon the mighty king of vultures volleys that were exceedingly
  dreadful.
'5': >-
  But the vulture Jaṭāyu, lord of the hosts of feathered chariots, received and
  withstood those nets of arrows—Rāvaṇa’s missiles—in the thick of battle.
'6': >-
  With his sharp talons and with his powerful feet, the best of birds, of great
  might, tore many wounds into the rākṣasa’s limbs again and again.
'7': >-
  Then, in fury, Daśagrīva seized ten arrows—terrible, like the staff of
  Death—desiring the destruction of his foe.
'8': >-
  With those arrows, released in full measure, straight-flying and of great
  force—keen and sharp, dreadful as iron darts—he pierced the vulture.
'9': >-
  Yet, seeing Jānakī on the rākṣasa’s chariot, her eyes filled with tears,
  Jaṭāyu gave no thought to those arrows and rushed at the rākṣasa.
'10': >-
  Then the mighty, resplendent bird, with his feet, shattered Rāvaṇa’s bow—still
  strung, and adorned with pearls and gems.
'11': >-
  Thereupon Rāvaṇa, overcome by a frenzy of wrath, took up another bow and
  rained down showers of arrows—by the hundreds and then by the thousands.
'12': >-
  Hemmed in by his arrows in the battle, the lord of birds appeared then like a
  bird that has reached its nest—pressed in on every side.
'13': >-
  Shaking off those nets of arrows with his wings, that great-glowing one again
  smashed Rāvaṇa’s mighty bow with his feet.
'14': >-
  And the bird-lord of great radiance beat down and scattered with his wings
  Rāvaṇa’s blazing quiver and store of arrows, shining like fire.
'15': >-
  He struck down in the fight those divine, golden breastplates, together with
  fierce, ass-faced (ghastly-faced) attendants—swift in onset—he, the mighty
  one.
'16': >-
  Then he also smashed the great chariot—endowed with triple-forked fittings,
  moving at will, flashing like firebrands, and inlaid with jeweled steps and
  variegated parts.
'17': >-
  Its parasol, bright as the full moon, together with its fly-whisks, he hurled
  down with force—along with the grasping rākṣasas attendant there.
'18': >-
  And with speed he struck down the charioteer as well; with his beak the
  illustrious, mighty king of birds again battered the rākṣasa’s great head.
'19': >-
  With his bow broken, his chariot ruined, his horses slain, and his charioteer
  killed, Rāvaṇa—holding Vaidehī upon his lap—fell to the ground.
'20': >-
  Seeing Rāvaṇa fallen on the earth, his conveyance shattered, the beings there
  praised the king of vultures, exclaiming, “Well done! Well done!”
'21': >-
  But seeing that leader of birds wearied and oppressed by age, Rāvaṇa,
  delighted, sprang up again, seizing Maithilī.
'22': >-
  Bearing Jānakī upon his lap, that exultant Rāvaṇa went forth—yet with only his
  sword remaining, his former equipment destroyed and lost.
'23': >-
  The king of vultures rose up once more and rushed at Rāvaṇa; blocking him,
  Jaṭāyu, of great splendor, spoke these words:
'24': >-
  “O Rāvaṇa, you of little understanding! You are carrying off the wife of Rāma,
  whose arrows are as the touch of the thunderbolt. This deed will surely become
  the destruction of the rākṣasas.”
'25': >-
  “With his allies and kinsmen, with his ministers, with his forces, with all
  his resources—this act of yours is like drinking poison as though it were
  water when one is thirsty.”
'26': >-
  “Those who do not comprehend the consequence of deeds, and are undiscerning
  about actions, quickly perish—just as you shall perish.”
'27': >-
  “You are bound by the noose of Time; where will you go to be freed from it?
  You have taken the bait for your own slaying, like a creature of the waters
  that swallows a hook with flesh upon it.”
'28': >-
  “Never, O Rāvaṇa, will the two Kakutsthas—those Rāghavas, hard to
  assail—tolerate your outrage and the violation of this hermitage.”
'29': >-
  “The deed you have done is that of a coward, condemned by the world—the path
  of a thief. This is not a course resorted to by heroes.”
'30': >-
  “Fight, if you are a warrior! Stand for a moment, O Rāvaṇa. Slain, you shall
  lie upon the earth, even as your brother Khara lies.”
'31': >-
  “At the time of death, the deed a man undertakes—if it is unrighteous—leads to
  his own ruin. Such an unrighteous deed you have undertaken, for your
  destruction.”
'32': >-
  “When an act is linked with sin in its consequence, what man—indeed, even if
  he were lord of the world, even if he were the Self-born Blessed One—would
  choose to do it?”
'33': >-
  Having spoken thus those auspicious words, Jaṭāyu, the valiant one, sprang
  fiercely onto the back of that rākṣasa, Daśagrīva.
'34': >-
  Seizing him with sharp talons, he tore him on every side—like an
  elephant-rider atop a vicious elephant, subduing it.
'35': >-
  Pressing his beak into Rāvaṇa’s back, he rent him with his claws; and with his
  talon-wings and beak as weapons, he tore out his hair as well.
'36': >-
  Thus tormented again and again by the king of vultures, the rākṣasa, his lips
  quivering with intolerant rage, began to tremble.
'37': >-
  Clasping Vaidehī with his left arm upon his lap, Rāvaṇa—pained and overcome by
  fury—struck Jaṭāyu with the palm of his hand.
'38': >-
  But Jaṭāyu, lord of birds, eluding him, struck with his beak and then tore
  away Rāvaṇa’s ten left arms—the foe-subduer did so then.
'39': >-
  The moment his arms were severed, new arms sprang forth at once—like serpents
  emerging from an ant-hill, accompanied by a blazing venomous radiance.
'40': >-
  Then Daśagrīva, in wrath, letting Sītā go, struck and beat down the king of
  vultures with his fists and with his feet, displaying his might.
'41': >-
  Thereupon for a short while the battle raged between those of incomparable
  valor—the foremost of the rākṣasas and the best among birds.
'42': >-
  As Jaṭāyu strove on for Rāma’s sake, Rāvaṇa drew his sword and cut off his two
  wings, his feet, and his flanks.
'43': >-
  With his wings shorn away, that great vulture, suddenly struck down by the
  rākṣasa of cruel deeds, fell to the earth, with little life remaining.
'44': >-
  Seeing Jaṭāyu fallen on the ground, drenched in blood, Vaidehī, sorrowing, ran
  toward him as though he were her own kinsman.
'45': >-
  The lord of Laṅkā beheld Jaṭāyu lying upon the earth—dark as a mass of blue
  clouds, with pale breast, of noble valor—quiet, like a forest-fire that has
  been quenched.
'46': >-
  Then Sītā, the daughter of Janaka, lifting up again that feathered
  chariot-warrior who lay upon the ground, crushed by Rāvaṇa’s onrush, wept—she
  whose face shone like the moon.
'47': >-
  Thus ends the Fifty-first Sarga of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Battle between Jaṭāyu and
  Rāvaṇa.”
