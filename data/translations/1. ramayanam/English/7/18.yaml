  Now begins the eighteenth canto, named “The Conquest (or Overpowering) of
  Marutta,” in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  When Vedavatī had entered the blazing fire, that Rāvaṇa, mounting the Puṣpaka
  aerial car, ranged about over the earth.
'2': >-
  Thereafter Rāvaṇa beheld king Marutta, engaged in sacrifice together with the
  gods, having reached a place called Uśīrabīja.
'3': >-
  A brahmarṣi named Saṁvarta—indeed the very brother of Bṛhaspati—wise in
  righteousness, caused that sacrifice to be performed, surrounded by all the
  hosts of gods.
'4': >-
  Seeing that rākṣasa rendered unconquerable by a boon, the gods—afraid to look
  upon him—entered into the wombs of animals (took animal forms).
'5': >-
  Indra became a peacock; Dharma-rāja (Yama) became a crow; the Lord of Wealth
  (Kubera), the overseer of riches, became a lizard; and Varuṇa became a swan.
'6': >-
  When, in this manner, the other gods had assumed such forms, O subduer of
  foes, Rāvaṇa entered the sacrifice—impure, like a dog—at once.
'7': >-
  Approaching that king, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, said: “Grant me battle;
  or else declare, ‘I am vanquished.’”
'8': >-
  Then king Marutta said to him, “Who are you?” Thereupon, abandoning mockery,
  Rāvaṇa spoke these words:
'9': >-
  “O king, I am pleased with you for your lack of curiosity, since you do not
  recognize me—Rāvaṇa, the younger brother of Dhanada (Kubera).”
'10': >-
  “Who else in the three worlds is there that does not know my might—by which,
  having conquered my elder brother, I have brought away this aerial car?” Then
  that king Marutta spoke to Rāvaṇa:
'11': >-
  “Truly, blessed are you, in that your eldest brother has been conquered in
  battle. In the three worlds, there exists none worthy of praise like you.”
'12': >-
  “Yet praise, when joined with adharma, is not fitting, nor is it in accord
  with the world’s righteous standard. Having performed a deed of wickedness,
  you are praised for conquering your brother!”
'13': >-
  “What are you, that having formerly practiced only dharma you obtained a boon?
  Never before have I heard words such as you yourself now speak.”
'14': >-
  “Stand now! You shall not go back alive, O evil-minded one. Today, with sharp
  arrows, I shall send you to Yama’s abode.”
'15': >-
  Then the lord of men took up his bow and arrows and, angered, went forth to
  battle; Saṁvarta blocked his path.
'16': >-
  That great sage spoke to Marutta with affectionate concern: “If my words are
  to be heeded, combat is not proper for you.”
'17': >-
  “This is a Maheśvara-sacrificial session; if it remains unfinished, it would
  consume (bring ruin upon) the entire lineage.”
'18': >-
  “For one who has been consecrated (dīkṣita), how can there be battle? And for
  the consecrated, whence anger? Moreover, in victory there is always
  uncertainty, and the rākṣasa is exceedingly hard to overcome.”
'19': >-
  Turning back at his guru’s words, Marutta, lord of the earth, released (set
  aside) his bow along with its arrow, and became composed, intent upon the
  sacrificial rite.
'20': >-
  Then Śuka, deeming him defeated, loudly proclaimed with joy, “Rāvaṇa is
  victorious!” and raised a great shout of exultation.
'21': >-
  Having devoured the great sages who were present there and had come for the
  sacrifice, and being satiated with their blood, he again set out over the
  earth.
'22': >-
  But when Rāvaṇa had gone, the gods—along with Indra and the other dwellers of
  heaven—then regained their own forms, and those beings spoke thus:
'23': >-
  Then Indra, in delight, spoke to the peacock with the dark (blue)
  crest-feathers: “I am pleased with you, O knower of dharma; you shall have no
  fear from serpents.”
'24': >-
  “And this thousand eyes—which will appear upon your tail-feathers—when I rain,
  you shall attain gladness, as a mark of my favor.” Thus Indra, lord of the
  gods, bestowed a boon upon the peacock.
'25': >-
  Formerly indeed, O lord of men, peacocks’ tail-feathers were blue; but having
  received a boon from the lord of the suras, all peacocks became possessed of
  such (splendid) plumes.
'26': >-
  Dharma-rāja said, O Rāma, to the crow standing in front: “O bird, I am greatly
  pleased with you; hear the words of one who is well-disposed.”
'27': >-
  “Just as other creatures are afflicted by various diseases through me, those
  shall not prevail over you when I am pleased—of this there is no doubt.”
'28': >-
  “You have no fear of death, O bird, by my boon. As long as men do not kill
  you, so long shall you continue to exist.”
'29': >-
  “These men who dwell in my domain, afflicted by the fear of hunger—when you
  have eaten, they along with their kinsmen shall be satisfied.”
'30': >-
  Varuṇa spoke to the swan that sports in the waters of the Gaṅgā: “Let my
  favor-laden words be heard, O lord of birds (lit., he whose chariot is
  wings).”
'31': >-
  “A charming, gentle hue, resembling the orb of the moon—bright and pure like
  white foam—shall become splendidly yours.”
'32': >-
  “Having attained my very body (i.e., by my grace and association), you shall
  ever be beautiful; and you shall obtain incomparable joy—this is the sign of
  my favor.”
'33': >-
  For formerly, O Rāma, the swans’ wings were blue with whitish tint; their tips
  were covered with blue, and their bellies were spotless like the points of
  fresh grass.
'34': >-
  Then Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera) spoke to the lizard standing upon a mountain: “I,
  too, being pleased with you, grant you a golden hue.”
'35': >-
  “And your head shall ever be possessed of excellent substance (rich,
  auspicious), inexhaustible. This golden color shall be yours through my
  favor.”
'36': >-
  Thus, having bestowed boons upon them at that sacrificial festival, the gods,
  together with the king, withdrew and went again to their own abodes.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the eighteenth canto, named “The Conquest of Marutta,” in the Uttara
  Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
