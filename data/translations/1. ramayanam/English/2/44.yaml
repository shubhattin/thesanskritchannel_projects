'0': >-
  Then, in the revered Śrī Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-fourth canto, called “Sumitrā’s Consolation.”
'1': >-
  Seeing Kauśalyā—chief among women—lamenting thus, Sumitrā, established in
  dharma, spoke to her words that were themselves righteous and in accord with
  dharma.
'2': >-
  O noble lady, your son is endowed with true virtues—he is the best of men.
  What is to be gained for you by such lamentation, or by such wretched weeping?
'3': >-
  O noble lady, that mighty-armed son of yours has gone forth, abandoning
  sovereignty, doing what is good—honouring his great-souled father, who is
  faithful to truth.
'4': >-
  Rāma, the foremost, stands firm in dharma—duly practised by the disciplined
  and virtuous, ever and unfailingly yielding its fruit hereafter. He is not one
  to be grieved for at any time.
'5': >-
  And Lakṣmaṇa too, ever faultless, follows the highest course of conduct in
  this matter; compassionate to all beings—this is gain indeed for that
  great-souled one.
'6': >-
  Though accustomed to comfort, Vaidehī well knows what sorrow there is in
  dwelling in the forest; yet she follows your son, that righteous-souled one.
'7': >-
  He who, as lord, causes the banner that is his fame to wave throughout the
  world—steadfast in dharma, devoted to vows of truth—what indeed has not been
  attained by your son?
'8': >-
  Knowing clearly Rāma’s purity of conduct and his supreme greatness, the Sun,
  with his rays, is surely not fit to scorch his limbs.
'9': >-
  At all times, the auspicious wind, issuing forth from the forests, tempered
  with cold and heat, will serve Rāghava as a comfort.
'10': >-
  When he lies down at night, the spotless Moon—like a father embracing
  him—touching him with coolness that dispels burning heat, will gladden him.
'11': >-
  For Brahmā granted divine weapons to him, the great in splendour, after
  beholding in battle the lord of Dānavas slain—Timidhvaja’s son.
'12': >-
  That hero, tiger among men, relying on the strength of his own arms, will
  dwell in that forest without fear, as though in a palace.
'13': >-
  Those enemies who, coming within the range of his arrows, go to
  destruction—how could the earth not be fit to remain under his शासन, his rule
  and governance?
'14': >-
  The prosperity and majesty of Rāma, and his valour, and his noble and
  auspicious nature—once his forest-dwelling is ended, he will swiftly attain
  his own kingdom.
'15': >-
  He would be the Sun even of the Sun, the Fire of fire; the lord even of the
  lord; the foremost splendour of splendour; the fame of fame; the patience even
  of patience.
'16': >-
  A deity even among deities, the most excellent of beings among beings—what
  faults at all are there in him, O lady, whether in the forest or even in the
  city?
'17': >-
  Together with the earth, with Vaidehī, and with royal fortune, that bull among
  men—Rāma—will soon be consecrated along with these three.
'18': >-
  Beholding him depart, the whole people in Ayodhyā—overwhelmed by the force of
  grief—shed tears born of sorrow.
'19': >-
  That invincible hero, clad in kuśa-grass and bark-garments as he goes—Lakṣmī
  herself, as it were in the form of Sītā, follows him. What, then, can be
  difficult for him to obtain?
'20': >-
  He whose excellence is the grasp of the bow, who bears arrows, sword, and
  weapons himself—before him goes Lakṣmaṇa. What, then, can be difficult for him
  to obtain?
'21': >-
  You shall see him again, returned after his forest-dwelling is completed.
  Abandon grief and delusion, O lady; I speak truth to you.
'22': >-
  O blameless and auspicious one, you shall again see your son—like the risen
  Moon—bowing down and saluting, with his head, these feet of yours.
'23': >-
  Beholding him re-enter again—consecrated, possessed of great royal
  splendour—you will quickly let fall from your eyes the waters born of joy.
'24': >-
  Let there be no grief for you, O lady, nor sorrow—no inauspiciousness is seen
  in Rāma. Soon you shall see your son with Sītā and with Lakṣmaṇa.
'25': >-
  Since, O sinless lady, you are the one by whom this entire people should be
  consoled, why now, O lady, do you make your heart so shaken and faint?
'26': >-
  You ought not to grieve, O lady, for whom Rāghava is a son; for in this world
  there is none greater than Rāma, steadfast upon the true path.
'27': >-
  Seeing that son of yours, with his friends, offering salutation, you will
  quickly shed tears of joy—like a rainy cloud-line.
'28': >-
  Your son, a bestower of boons, will soon return to Ayodhyā, and with his two
  hands—soft and full—will press and massage your feet.
'29': >-
  When that heroic son of yours, with his friends, bows down and pays obeisance,
  you will sprinkle your son with tears of joy—like a streak of clouds
  sprinkling a mountain.
'30': >-
  Thus, consoling her with many kinds of words, blameless Sumitrā—skilful in the
  courtesies and proprieties of speech—having spoken so to Rāma’s mother,
  ceased.
'31': >-
  Hearing that speech of Lakṣmaṇa’s mother, addressed to Rāma’s mother, the
  queen of the king, her grief at once vanished from her body—like an autumn
  cloud with little water dissolved away.
'32': >-
  Thus ends the forty-fourth canto, called “Sumitrā’s Consolation,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
