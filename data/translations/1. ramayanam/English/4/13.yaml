  Now begins the thirteenth canto (sarga), named “Salutation to the Hermitage of
  the Seven Sages (Saptajana)”, in the Kishkindhā Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then that righteous-souled one—Rāma, the elder brother of Lakṣmaṇa—proceeded
  from Ṛṣyamūka to Kiṣkindhā, accompanied by Sugrīva, (the city) guarded by the
  prowess of Vāli.
'2': >-
  Stringing (and making ready) his great bow, adorned with gold, Rāma took in
  hand arrows brilliant as the sun—those fit to accomplish battle.
'3': >-
  In front of that great-souled Rāghava went Sugrīva, keeping his neck drawn in
  (with guarded alertness), and also mighty-armed Lakṣmaṇa.
'4': >-
  Behind them went the heroic Hanumān, and Nala and Nīla, possessed of great
  valor, and Tārā as well—highly splendid—the leader of leaders of the monkey
  hosts.
'5': >-
  As they went, they looked upon trees bowed down by the weight of blossoms, and
  also upon clear-flowing rivers, whose waters ran on toward the ocean.
'6': >-
  They beheld caves and mountains, and ravines and grottoes likewise; and the
  principal peaks, and lovely-looking valleys and clefts.
'7': >-
  And along the path they observed water-filled ponds made beautiful with
  crystal-clear waters like vaidūrya gems, and with lotuses—some open, some
  still in bud.
'8': >-
  They saw those ponds resounding with the calls of kāraṇḍa birds, sārasa
  cranes, swans, vañjula birds, waterfowl, cakravāka birds, and other kinds of
  birds.
'9': >-
  Everywhere they saw deer standing in open tracts of land—forest-ranging
  creatures, fearless, feeding on tender grass-shoots.
'10': >-
  They also saw forest-dwelling elephants—terrible, roaming in many ways, their
  white tusks serving as ornaments—foes of the ponds and breakers of the banks.
'11': >-
  They saw monkeys as well, like elephants in appearance—intoxicated, dwelling
  on lofty mountain slopes, moving like living mountains, their bodies dusted
  with the earth’s pollen and dust.
'12': >-
  Thus, beholding other forest-dwellers in the woods and birds that move in the
  sky, Sugrīva’s followers went on swiftly.
'13': >-
  While they were thus proceeding there in haste, Rāma, the delight of the Raghu
  line, seeing a grove thick with clusters of trees, spoke to Sugrīva.
'14': >-
  “This mass of trees shines in the sky like a cloud—broad like a gathering of
  clouds, and encircled at its edges by banana plants.”
'15': >-
  “I wish to know what this is, my friend; curiosity has arisen in me. I desire
  that you dispel my curiosity.”
'16': >-
  Hearing those words of the great-souled Rāghava, Sugrīva, as he continued
  walking, pointed out and explained that great forest.
'17': >-
  “This, O Rāghava, is a spacious hermitage that removes fatigue—endowed with
  gardens and groves, and possessing sweet roots, fruits, and water.”
'18': >-
  “Here are sages named the ‘Seven Persons’ (Saptajana), of well-tempered vows.
  Those seven indeed remained with their heads downward, regularly lying upon
  water (in austerity).”
'19': >-
  “Taking food only once in seven nights, subsisting on air, and dwelling
  without movement, they went to heaven after hundreds of years—those seven,
  with their bodies entire.”
'20': >-
  “By the power of their austerity, this hermitage—enclosed as though by a
  rampart of trees—has become exceedingly difficult to assail, even for gods and
  asuras, even when led by Indra.”
'21': >-
  “Birds avoid this place, and so do other forest-roamers. Even those who enter
  here out of delusion do not return again.”
'22': >-
  “Here, O Rāghava, distinct sounds of ornaments are heard clearly, and also the
  sounds of music and song; and a divine fragrance (is perceived).”
'23': >-
  “The three sacred fires blaze here too; and this smoke is seen—like a cloud,
  tinged with the reddish hue of a pigeon’s limbs, as though it were wrapping
  around the tops of the trees.”
'24': >-
  “These trees appear with their crowns clinging to the smoke, like vaidūrya
  mountains veiled by a net of clouds.”
'25': >-
  “O righteous-souled Rāghava, offer salutations directed toward those
  sages—together with your brother Lakṣmaṇa—composed and with joined palms.”
'26': >-
  “For those who bow to those sages of perfected, disciplined selves, no
  inauspiciousness whatsoever, O Rāma, remains in their bodies.”
'27': >-
  Then Rāma, together with his brother Lakṣmaṇa, with palms joined, directed his
  reverence toward those great sages and paid them homage.
'28': >-
  Having thus saluted them, the righteous Rāma and his brother Lakṣmaṇa, and
  Sugrīva and the monkeys as well, proceeded with hearts filled with joy.
'29': >-
  Having gone a long way from that hermitage of the Seven Sages, they beheld
  that unassailable Kiṣkindhā, guarded by Vāli.
'30': >-
  Then those heroes—Rāma, his younger brother, and the monkeys—seizing their
  weapons, their fierce splendor now risen, came back here again to the city
  guarded by the valor of the son of the lord of the gods (Sugrīva), for the
  slaying of the enemy.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the thirteenth canto, named “Salutation to the Hermitage of the
  Seven Sages (Saptajana)”, in the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
