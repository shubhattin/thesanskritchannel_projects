  Now, in the blessed Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, the fiftieth sarga,
  entitled “The Meeting with Janaka.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, proceeding towards the north-east together with Saumitri
  (Lakṣmaṇa), and placing Viśvāmitra in the forefront, approached the
  sacrificial enclosure.
'2': >-
  Rāma, along with Lakṣmaṇa, spoke to that tiger among sages: “Indeed, the
  sacrificial arrangements of the great-souled Janaka are proper and exceedingly
  prosperous.
'3': >-
  Here are many thousands—men dwelling in diverse regions—highly fortunate
  Brāhmaṇas, rich in Vedic study.
'4': >-
  And the hermitages of the ṛṣis are seen, thronged with hundreds of carts. O
  Brāhmaṇa, let a place be appointed where we may dwell.”
'5': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, the great sage Viśvāmitra made his residence in a
  secluded spot furnished with water.
'6': >-
  Then, hearing that Viśvāmitra had arrived, the foremost of kings—Janaka, the
  blameless one—placing Śatānanda, his priest, at the head, (went forth to
  receive him).
'7': >-
  The great-souled officiating priests also, taking the offering of honor
  (arghya), swiftly and at once went forward to welcome him, endowed with
  humility.
'8': >-
  To Viśvāmitra he duly offered that honor, in accordance with dharma, and with
  dharma held foremost. Having accepted that worship from the great-souled
  Janaka,
'9': >-
  Viśvāmitra inquired of the king’s welfare, and of the sacrifice being free
  from trouble. And he also questioned those sages, together with the teachers
  and the royal priest.
'10': >-
  And all the ṛṣis, according to their due, came together in delight. Then the
  king, with hands joined in reverence, addressed the foremost of sages.
'11': >-
  “Let the Blessed One be seated,” (said Janaka), together with these eminent
  sages. Hearing Janaka’s words, the great sage sat down.
'12': >-
  The royal priest, the officiating priests, and the king with his ministers,
  sat down all around upon seats, as was proper and according to rule.
'13': >-
  Seeing Viśvāmitra there, that king then said: “Today my sacrifice has attained
  fullness; it has been made fruitful by the gods.
'14': >-
  Today I have gained the fruit of the sacrifice, through the sight of the
  Blessed One. I am blessed; I am favored—inasmuch as the foremost of sages has
  come to me.
'15': >-
  O Brāhmaṇa, you have arrived at this sacrificial hall together with the sages.
  O brahmarṣi, the wise declare the consecration (dīkṣā) to be of twelve days.
'16': >-
  Therefore, O Kauśika, you ought to behold the gods who come to claim their
  respective shares.” Having spoken thus to that tiger among sages, the king
  then bore a delighted countenance.
'17': >-
  Then again, the restrained king, with palms joined, asked him: “May good be
  yours! These two youths, possessing prowess like unto the gods—
'18': >-
  heroes with the gait of elephants, resembling a tiger and a bull; with large
  eyes like lotus-petals; bearing sword, quiver, and bow; like the twin Aśvins
  in form; standing forth in the bloom of youth—
'19': >-
  as if by mere chance have they come to my land, like two immortals from the
  world of the gods. How have they come here on foot? For what purpose, and
  whose (sons) are they, O sage?
'20': >-
  These two heroes, bearing excellent weapons—whose sons are they, O great
  sage—adorning this country like the moon and the sun adorning the sky?
'21': >-
  Alike to each other in measure, in expression, and in their movements; both
  heroes wearing the side-locks (kāka-pakṣa)—I desire to hear the truth in
  full.”
'22': >-
  Hearing those words of the great-souled Janaka, the immeasurable-souled
  Viśvāmitra made known to him that they were the two sons of Daśaratha.
'23': >-
  He also related their dwelling at Siddhāśrama, and the slaying of the
  rākṣasas, and their untroubled coming therefrom, and the sight of Viśālā (the
  city).
'24': >-
  And he told of the sight of Ahalyā, and of the meeting with Gautama, and also
  of their coming in order to learn about the great bow.
'25': >-
  Having thus reported all of this to the great-souled Janaka, that mighty
  one—Viśvāmitra, the great sage—then ceased.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the fiftieth sarga of the Bāla-kāṇḍa in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  ancient ṛṣi-composed epic, entitled “The Meeting with Janaka.”
