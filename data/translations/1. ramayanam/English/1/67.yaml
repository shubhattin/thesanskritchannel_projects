  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-seventh chapter, called “The Breaking of the Bow.”
'1': >-
  Hearing Janaka’s words, the great sage Viśvāmitra said to that monarch: “Show
  the bow to Rāma.”
'2': >-
  Thereupon King Janaka gave orders to his ministers: “Let the divine bow be
  brought—adorned with fragrances, garlands, and unguents.”
'3': >-
  Commanded by Janaka, the ministers entered the city; and placing that bow in
  front, those men of immeasurable energy came out.
'4': >-
  Fifty hundreds of men—mighty and broad-shouldered great-souled ones—somehow
  managed to lift that casket with eight wheels.
'5': >-
  Taking that fine casket of iron in which that bow was kept, the king’s
  counselors spoke to Janaka, the lord of men, saying, “O King, it is here,” and
  the bow shone like the gods.
'6': >-
  “O King, this excellent bow, worshipped by all kings—O sovereign lord of
  Mithilā, O best of rulers—may be seen, if you so desire.”
'7': >-
  Hearing their words, the king spoke with palms joined, addressing the
  great-souled Viśvāmitra, and also those two—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.
'8': >-
  “This supreme bow has been duly honored by the Janakas, and in former times it
  filled the mighty kings with helplessness—for they were not capable of bending
  it.”
'9': >-
  “Neither all the hosts of gods, nor the Asuras, nor the Rākṣasas; nor the
  foremost among Gandharvas and Yakṣas; nor the Kinnaras and great serpents—none
  of them…”
'10': >-
  “…what then is the capacity of human beings in the stringing of this
  bow—whether in raising it, in fitting the string, in drawing it, in making it
  bend, or in lifting and balancing it?”
'11': >-
  “This best of bows has now been brought, O foremost of sages. O greatly
  fortunate one, let it be shown to these two princes.”
'12': >-
  Viśvāmitra, with Rāma, having heard Janaka’s speech, said to the Rāghava: “My
  child Rāma, behold the bow.”
'13': >-
  At the great sage’s word, Rāma went to where the bow stood; opening that
  casket, and seeing the bow, he spoke as follows:
'14': >-
  “This supreme, divine bow—I shall touch it here with my hand. And I shall
  exert myself, whether in lifting it or in stringing it as well.”
'15': >-
  The king said, “So be it,” and the sage too assented. Then, in obedience to
  the sage’s word, Rāma grasped the bow at the middle as though in sport.
'16': >-
  While thousands of men looked on—many indeed—the righteous-souled delight of
  the Raghu line raised that bow, as if effortlessly, like a mere plaything.
'17': >-
  Having raised it and set the bowstring upon it, the illustrious best of men
  drew it; and then he broke the bow in its very middle.
'18': >-
  From that there arose a mighty sound, like the reverberation of a thunderbolt;
  and there was a very great trembling of the earth, as though a mountain were
  splitting asunder.
'19': >-
  All the people fell down, bewildered by that sound—except the foremost of
  sages, the king, and those two Rāghavas.
'20': >-
  When the people had recovered, the king—his fear departed—spoke with palms
  joined to the sage, O bull among ascetics, skilled in speech:
'21': >-
  “O Blessed One, I have beheld the valor of Rāma, son of Daśaratha. This is
  exceedingly wondrous—unthinkable and wholly beyond what I had imagined.”
'22': >-
  “My daughter Sītā, having obtained Rāma, the son of Daśaratha, as her husband,
  shall bring renown to the line of the Janakas.”
'23': >-
  “True is that vow of mine, O Kauśika—that her bride-price is valor. Sītā,
  dearly loved as my very life, my daughter, must be given to Rāma.”
'24': >-
  “With your consent, O Brāhman, let my ministers quickly depart—may
  auspiciousness attend you, O Kauśika—to Ayodhyā in swift chariots.”
'25': >-
  “Let them bring the king to my city with humble words, and let them relate in
  full the matter of giving her in marriage, for which valor is the
  bride-price.”
'26': >-
  “And let them tell the king about the two scions of Kakutstha, guarded by the
  sage; and, with gladdened hearts, let them bring the king back with all
  speed.”
'27': >-
  Kauśika said, “So be it.” And the righteous King Janaka, having addressed and
  instructed his ministers, sent them to Ayodhyā—to narrate exactly what had
  occurred and likewise to bring the king.
'28': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-seventh chapter of the Bāla-kāṇḍa in the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Breaking of the Bow.”
