  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-fourth sarga, entitled “The creation of the Pahlavas and others.”
'1': >-
  When the sage Vasiṣṭha would not give up the wish-granting cow Kāmadhenu, then
  Viśvāmitra dragged away Śabalā (that cow), O Rāma.
'2': >-
  As Śabalā was being led away by that great-souled king, O Rāma, she, afflicted
  with sorrow, began to ponder, grieving and weeping, crushed by anguish.
'3': >-
  “Have I been cast off by Vasiṣṭha, that exceedingly great-souled one, that
  I—wretched—should be carried away by the king’s men, deeply afflicted with
  pain?”
'4': >-
  “What wrong have I done to that great seer of disciplined spirit, that the
  righteous one, seeing me who am guiltless and devoted, abandons me?”
'5': >-
  Thus reflecting, and heaving sighs again and again, she then went swiftly to
  Vasiṣṭha of surpassing splendor.
'6': >-
  Shaking off those attendants by the hundreds, O destroyer of foes, she went
  with the speed of the wind to the feet of that great-souled one.
'7': >-
  That Śabalā, weeping and crying out, spoke these words—standing before
  Vasiṣṭha, with a voice like the rumbling of clouds, she lamented:
'8': >-
  “Blessed Lord, why have I been forsaken by you, O son of Brahmā? For the
  king’s soldiers are leading me away from your presence.”
'9': >-
  Thus addressed, the Brahmarṣi spoke these words to her—her heart scorched by
  grief, sorrowing like a distressed sister:
'10': >-
  “I do not abandon you, O Śabale, nor have you done any harm to me. This king,
  of great might, is taking you away from me by force.”
'11': >-
  “Indeed, my strength is not equal to the king’s—especially in your matter. The
  king is powerful; he is a kṣatriya, and truly the lord of the earth.”
'12': >-
  “This complete akṣauhiṇī army—thronged with elephants, horses, and chariots,
  and filled with standards of elephants—(stands with him); therefore he is the
  stronger.”
'13': >-
  So spoken to by Vasiṣṭha, she replied in a humble manner—she who understood
  speech addressed that Brahmarṣi of incomparable radiance, fitting words:
'14': >-
  “They do not call the strength of a kṣatriya the greater; the brāhmaṇas are
  said to be mightier. O Brahman, the divine strength of Brahman (brahma-bala)
  is greater than kṣatriya strength.”
'15': >-
  “Your power is immeasurable; none is stronger than you. Viśvāmitra, though of
  great valor, cannot withstand your splendor; your might is unassailable.”
'16': >-
  “Command me, O great-tejas, me who am furnished with the power of Brahman. I
  shall destroy the pride, the strength, and the endeavor of that wicked-souled
  one.”
'17': >-
  When she had spoken thus, O Rāma, the greatly renowned Vasiṣṭha said to her
  then: “Create (them)—set loose the force that crushes the enemy’s force.”
'18': >-
  Hearing his words, Surabhi (Śabalā) then brought forth (warriors). From her
  bellowing were produced Pahlavas by the hundreds, O king.
'19': >-
  They destroyed all the forces of Viśvāmitra before his very eyes. That king,
  exceedingly enraged, with eyes widened by wrath,
'20': >-
  set about destroying the Pahlavas with weapons of various kinds. Seeing the
  Pahlavas thus afflicted by Viśvāmitra, by the hundreds,
'21': >-
  she again created dreadful Śakas mixed with Yavanas. By those Śakas mingled
  with Yavanas, the earth became covered.
'22': >-
  They were mighty and of great valor, resembling golden filaments (of a lotus);
  bearing sharp swords and spears, and clad in golden-hued garments.
'23': >-
  All that army was burned away, as though by blazing fires. Then Viśvāmitra, of
  great splendor, discharged celestial weapons; and by them those Yavanas,
  Kāmbhojas, and Barbarians were thrown into confusion and distress.
'24': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fourth sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The creation of
  the Pahlavas and others.”
