'0': The Waves of Beauty
'1': First Part - The Waves of Bliss!
'2': |-
  To those who slip and fall on the ground,
  the ground itself offers support!
  Similarly, for those who commit mistakes in your worship,
  you alone offer refuge, O Goddess!
'3': >-
  Someone as powerful as lord shiva himself, is only capable of action, when he
  is united with shakti. 

  If he is not united with shakti, he is not even capable of even reacting to
  situations; 

  or in other words, he becomes inert! If such is your importance when it comes
  to performing action, 

  then how O Great Goddess, can someone perform your worship or praise, 

  without having done any good deed! In other words, one must be really
  fortunate 

  and must have accumulated a lot of virtue, to even attempt praising or
  worshipping you!
'4': >-
  O Goddess! Lord brahmA collects the dust below your feet, and from it, 

  creates all these worlds to perfection! Lord viShNu with thousands of heads
  maintains these worlds 

  with great effort, and Lord shiva, with utmost reverence powders these worlds 

  back into sacred ash and smears it all over his body.
'5': >-
  O Goddess! These particles are like an island from which arises the Sun, 

  who dispels the darkness of ignorance. They are like a delicious torrent of
  honey 

  which causes brightness and invigorates the dull ones! They are like a garland
  of precious jewels 

  for those who are struck with poverty, and for those who are drowned in the
  sorrows of life and death, 

  they are like the tusks of Lord varAha, who saved Mother Earth from drowning
  in the oceans!
'6': >-
  O Goddess, who is the refuge to the people of all worlds, Gods and Goddesses
  other than you 

  display abhaya:fear dispelling and varada:boon providing mudras with both
  their hands. 

  You alone never display these varada and abhaya mudras since your feet
  themselves 

  are adept at removing the fears and fulfilling the desires of the beings of
  all the worlds!
'7': >-
  Worshipping you, who bestows prosperity upon all your devotees, hari(viShNu) 

  was able to become a charming female and stir waves of passion in the minds of
  no less a deity 

  than hara, the Destroyer of the Three Cities! And smara(manmatha, the lord of
  love), 

  through your worship, obtained a form— which is truly a feast for the eyes of
  his consort ratI devI, 

  with which he has become capable of causing deep infatuation even in the minds
  of sages!
'8': >-
  His bow is made only of flowers; its bow-string is a line of honey-bees; he
  has only five arrows, 

  and these are made of flowers too! His minister is the(periodical and
  non-dependable) spring season; 

  his battle-chariot is the(shifting and formless) breeze; and above all, he is
  ananga, 

  the bodiless one. Yet, O Daughter of the Mountain! blessed by your gracious
  side-glance, 

  he, by himself alone, is victorious over the entire world!
'9': >-
  May the mother Goddess, who has a jingling waistband, whose breasts are
  curved 

  like the temples of a young elephant cub, whose waist is slender, whose face
  is as bright 

  as the fully formed moon of sharad Rtu, who holds a bow, arrows, a noose and a
  goad in her four hands, 

  and who is the great consort of lord shiva, who vanquished tripurAsura, be
  present in front of us!
'10': >-
  O Goddess! Situated in the middle of the milky ocean, surrounded by a garden
  of celestial trees, 

  within an island of jewels, containing an orchard of kadamba trees; 

  Within a house made of chintAmaNi jewels, resting upon the seat which is lord
  paramashiva himself 

  - this is how the truly fortunate worship you, who is the very embodiment of
  the waves 

  of ultimate conscious bliss, called as chidAnanda.
'11': >-
  Having penetrated the pRthvI(Earth) element situated in the mUlAdhAra, 

  The jala(Water)  element in the maNipUraka, the agni(Fire) element in the
  svAdhiShThAna, 

  the vAyu(Air) element in the anAhata, the AkAsha(Space) element above it, in
  the vishuddhi, 

  and manas(Mind) in the AjnA between the eye-brows, you, ascending through the
  suShumnA 

  or the kula path, are engaged in loving sport with your consort 

  in the solitude of sahasrAra, the thousand-Petalled Lotus!
'12': >-
  Drenching the whole creation, with the nectar flowing down from both your
  feet, 

  you descend from the exuberance of the Nectarine Radiance of the Moon. 

  You flow down into your own abode in the mUlAdhAra at the lower end of the
  suShumnA, 

  assuming your coiled serpentine form, and lie dormant there.
'13': >-
  The four shrI-kanThas(shiva-chakras) and the five
  shiva-yuvatis(shakti-chakras) are 

  the nine mUla-prakRtis(basic manifestations), punctuated by the bindu 

  or the origin-point, in the centre. Then there are two lotuses, one of eight
  petals 

  and another of sixteen, and then the three surrounding circles and then, three
  lines. 

  This forms your mansion with forty-four sharaNa-koNas(Places of Refuge). 
'14': >-
  O Daughter of the Snow-Capped-Mountain! The greatest of poets like brahmA —
  try in many ways 

  to portray your beauty, and fail to find any other object to describe it
  through comparison. 

  The kind of beauty through which even the celestial damsels, out of their
  eagerness to experience it, 

  attain to the State of Oneness with shiva, which is difficult to gain, even by
  severe austerities!
'15': >-
  If your gracious side-glance falls on even a very decrepit old man who is ugly
  to look at, 

  and whose erotic sensibilities are inert, he will be followed in all haste, 

  by hundreds of love-lorn young women, with their locks scattered, 

  with their upper garments disturbed from their vessels like breasts, 

  their waist-bands undone in the sudden excitement, and their drapes slipping
  away!
'16': >-
  With fifty-six components in the mUlAdhAra which corresponds to kShiti(Earth
  Element), 

  fifty-two components in svAdhiShThAna, which corresponds to udaka(Water
  Element), 

  sixty-two components in the maNipUraka which corresponds to hutAsha(Fire
  Element), 

  fifty-four in anAhata which corresponds to anila(Air Element), seventy-two in
  vishuddhi 

  which corresponds to divi(Space), and sixty-four in AjnA which corresponds to
  manas(Mind); 

  above these components of beams of light, rest both your feet, acting as a
  source of all of them!
'17': >-
  How could torrents of sweet words flow out of the pious ones! 

  Words which are sweeter even than honey, milk and grape-juice, without
  worshipping you, 

  who shines with the purity of the autumnal moon, 

  who has the crescent moon as a jewel on the crown of matted locks of hair, 

  who holds the vara-mudra(that grants boons) and trAsatrANa-mudra(that removes
  fears) in two of your hands, 

  and a sphaTika-mAlA(a rosary of crystal beads) and a pustaka(a book)in the
  other two.
'18': >-
  Those sages who worship you, as the very embodiment of reddish glow, 

  shining with the resplendence of the early morning sun, that makes the
  lotus-like minds 

  of the greatest poets blossom, are filled with pleasure.

  The pleasure born out of the most profound words of wisdom, arising from the
  young waves 

  of extreme beauty of the beloved of virinchi(lord brahmA)! 
'19': >-
  O Mother! The one who meditates upon you in association with vashinI 

  and allied Deities — who are all the sources of speech, and whose radiance 

  resembles the lustre of freshly cut chandrakAnta jewel - such a person becomes
  capable 

  of authoring poetic works as delightful as those of the great sages, with
  words 

  as sweet as the ones flowing out of the lotus-face of vAgdevI, Goddess
  sarasvatI herself!
'20': |-
  The one who visualizes the entire sky and earth, filled with a reddish glow, 
  emanating from the radiant light pouring out of your auspicious form, 
  such a person has countless highly skilled celestial damsels like UrvashI, 
  with their bashful eyes like forest deer, in his command!
'21': >-
  O consort of hara! By correlating your face, as the bindu; the pair of
  breasts, as the part below it; 

  and your form, as the half of hara himself; one who meditates upon your
  manmathakaLA thus, 

  such a person shall be able to attract the mind of any woman! In fact, this is
  of such little consequence, 

  because such a person shall be able to attract the entire existence, 

  which can be embodied as a beautiful woman with the Sun and Moon for her
  breasts. 
'22': >-
  The one who meditates upon you, who radiates luminescence from your body, just
  as a moonstone does,

  such a person becomes capable of humbling the pride and ferocity of serpents,
  like garuDa himself!

  Such a person becomes capable of comforting someone afflicted with fever, by
  his mere gaze

  which is as soothing as a stream of nectar!
'23': >-
  Great yogis, with their minds free from impurities, experience great bliss, 

  by gazing upon your form, which is like streaks of Lightning, Sun, Moon and
  Fire, 

  appearing at sahasrAra, above all the six chakras.
'24': >-
  O Goddess! The one who seeks to praise you with the words, "bhavAni tvam dAse
  mayi 

  vitara dRShTim sakaruNAm", which means, "O bhavAni, you please shower your
  compassionate glances 

  upon this poor servant of yours!", you grant him the very abode of unity with
  your own self! 

  That abode, which shines with the light reflected from the crowns of the very
  likes of brahmA, 

  viShNu and shiva, who bow down with their heads before it! This is because the
  very first words 

  in such a prayer, "bhavAni tvam" in Sanskrit also have the meaning of "I must
  be you!"
'25': >-
  Not being satisfied even after occupying the left half of shiva, 

  I wonder if you have occupied his right half too!

  I think so, since I perceive that form to be glowing red completely, with
  three eyes,

  slightly crouched forward due to the heaviness of your bosom, 

  with a curved crescent moon on your crown!
'26': >-
  brahmA gives birth to this existence, viShNu sustains it, and rudra destroys
  it. 

  Isha reverses the whole process absorbing all of it into his own self.

  sadAshiva conducts all this through the power of his grace!

  All these five, perform these activities upon receiving your command, 

  conveyed through a momentary movement of your eyebrows!
'27': >-
  O Auspicious One! The worship of all the three Gods, brahmA, viShNu and
  shiva, 

  born out of the three gunas, is considered to be performed as soon as your
  feet are worshipped!

  It is because all these deities are situated at the base of your abode, the
  maNidvIpa(shrI chakra), 

  by holding their hands clasped in prayer above their heads!
'28': >-
  virinchi(brahmA) is reduced into elements, hari(viShNu) attains to
  passiveness, 

  kInAsha(yama, the god of death) is himself destroyed; kubera, the god of
  wealth meets his end; 

  and indra, along with all his followers have their eyes shut during
  dissolution. 

  In that time of total dissolution(mahAsaMhAra) of the universe, 

  O Goddess, your husband sadAshiva alone is the one who plays!
'29': >-
  May my utterances be your chant! May the movements of my hands be the mudras
  of your worship!

  May my wanderings be your circum-ambulations! And may my eating and breathing
  be your offerings!

  May my lying down be your prostrations! And in the sense of surrendering very
  own self unto you, 

  may all the pleasures that I enjoy in my life, be the offerings in your
  service!
'30': >-
  Even after consuming sudhA(divine-nectar), which removes the fears of old age
  and death, 

  devas like brahmA and indra perish during the time of the cosmic dissolution.

  On the other hand, despite consuming the terrible poison of hAlAhala, 

  there is no end to your consort, shiva! 

  O Mother, this is indeed due to the unending glory of your ear-ornaments! 
'31': >-
  "Avoid stumbling on the crown of virinchi(brahmA)! Be cautious of the crown of
  kaiTabha-bhida(viShNu)! 

  Take care not to slip on the hard crown of jambhAri(indra)!"

  May these utterances of your attendants, cautioning you of the crowns of the
  bowed-down devas,

  as you move in haste to welcome your consort bhava at your abode, be ever
  victorious!
'32': >-
  O Eternal Mother Who Is Worshipped By All! What is surprising about the fact, 

  that someone who meditates upon you, identifying oneself with you, 

  as being surrounded by the divine forces like aNimA, emanating like rays out
  of your body,

  such a person discards even the riches of enlightenment, and even the cosmic
  dissolution 

  can only be an offering of nIrAjana to such a person!
'33': >-
  By pervading the entire creation through his forty-four techniques of tantra, 

  lord pashupati, then established himself in each of those techniques, which
  bear fruit to a sAdhaka.

  And then again, upon your compulsion, he gave birth to all of the attainments
  of mankind!

  Thus your systems of tantra, unique and independent from all the rest,
  descended upon this world!
'34': >-
  O Mother! The twelve syllables in three groups, corresponding to shiva,
  shakti, kAma, kShiti; 

  ravi, shItakiraNa, smara, haMsa, shakra; para, amara, and hari; 

  along with the sound hRllekha at the end of each group, constitute the
  panchadashI mantra 

  which describes the glory of your name and form!
'35': >-
  O Eternal Goddess! Yet others, who are ever immersed in the pleasures of
  existence, 

  add the three syllables corresponding to smara, yoni, and lakShmI in front of
  the previous mantra, 

  and do a continuous chant of the resulting aShTAdashAkSharI mantra, with
  chintAmaNi beads, 

  and hundreds of offerings of cow-ghee into the shivAgni within them!
'36': >-
  O Goddess! You are the physical form of lord shambhu, with the Sun and the
  Moon as the breasts!

  In turn, I perceive your flawless form to be of lord shiva's own self!

  Therefore, based on the principle of relationship between the base, and the
  accessory, 

  the relationship between both of you, who are the embodiments of transcendent
  bliss, 

  and eternal consciousness, stands even!
'37': >-
  You are the Mind, you are Space, you are Air, and you are Fire!

  You are Water, and you are Earth! There is no abode beyond attaining
  perfection in your worship!

  In order to expand yourself into a cosmic form, you yourself are manifest 

  as the consort of chidAnandAkAra(shiva-embodiment of the bliss of
  consciousness)!
'38': >-
  Situated at your AjnA chakra, with the brightness of a million suns, 

  I worship lord shambhu of the beyond, who is of the form of two conjoined
  halves!

  Through a devoted worship of whom, one eternally resides in the realm of
  radiance, 

  which transcends the realm that can be perceived through the physical-light of
  the Sun, Moon and Fire!
'39': >-
  In your vishuddhi-chakra, I offer my service to lord shiva, who shines like
  clear crystal, 

  and who is the creator of vyoma(space), and also to devI who is manifest as an
  equal to the lord,

  through the brilliance of whose moon-like shine, the entire creation, 

  rid of its impurities, rejoices like a chakorI bird!
'40': >-
  Next, I worship the pair of haMsas that dwell in the hearts of great beings, 

  relishing the honey of the fully blossomed-lotuses of their wisdom!

  Through the mutual songs of which, one masters all the 18 systems of
  knowledge, 

  and which separates one's virtues from vices, like separating milk from
  water! 
'41': |-
  O Mother, in your svAdhiShThAna chakra, I worship the pair of you as saMvarta 
  and the great samayA, established with fire as their base.
  The enraged sight of which ends up in the burning up of all worlds,
  and the compassionate glance of which provides cool and pleasant relief!
'42': >-
  In the maNipUraka-chakra, I worship the one who is like the
  darkness-dispelling lightning, 

  which is resplendent in the colours of a rainbow! I worship your dark
  raincloud-like manifestation 

  that brings its showers cooling down the three-worlds heated up by the
  Sun-like shiva!
'43': >-
  In your mUlAdhAra chakra, I meditate upon the navAtman(lord shiva), 

  engaged in the maha-tANDava, with all the nava-rasas, in the company of
  samayA(devI shakti) 

  engaged in a pleasant-lAsya. I perceive that it is because of this mutual
  dance, 

  graciously aimed towards the birth of creation, that this existence now has a
  father and a mother!
'44': Second Part - The Waves of Beauty!
'45': >-
  O Daughter of the Snowy Mountain! Whoever describes your golden crown, 

  set densely with the Twelve Suns made into jewels – will such a person not be
  of the impression 

  that the crescent moon on your head, reflecting various colours from the hem
  of your golden crown, 

  is verily lord indra's bow itself!?
'46': >-
  O Auspicious Goddess! May your tresses of hair, resembling a forest of
  full-blown blue lotuses, 

  thick, soft and oiled, remove the darkness of ignorance. 

  I presume that the heavenly flowers of indra’s garden have taken a place in
  your hair 

  to imbibe a little of their natural fragrance!
'47': >-
  O Goddess! The partition of hair on your head, which looks like the path of a
  flowing stream, 

  that carries the waves of beauty emanating from your face, 

  which, being smeared by sindUra(Vermillion) appears like the penetrating beam 

  of early-morning sunlight being bound on both sides by its enemy, the
  pitch-darkness of the night, 

  caused by your thick dark locks of hair, cover us with well-being!
'48': >-
  O Goddess! The beauty of your face covered in naturally curly and thick locks
  of hair, 

  resembling shining bumblebees, mocks at the famed beauty of a lotus,

  since compared to a mere lotus, your lotus-like face, with its fragrance being
  emanated 

  by the sweet pollen-like teeth when you smile, is causing intoxication 

  to the bumblebees which are verily the dark-eyes of lord shiva!
'49': >-
  O Goddess! Your forehead which shines with enormous beauty, 

  I think it is the second half of crescent moon that has been studded into your
  crown!

  When conjoined with the twisted crescent moon on top of your crown, 

  it looks like the moon attains fullness, and starts dripping divine elixir!
'50': >-
  O Goddess umA, whose eyebrows are slightly curved, as you are ever immersed 

  in destroying the fears of existence, your curved-eyebrows along with your
  thick 

  bumblebee-like eyelashes which form a string, seem like an outstretched bow 

  held in an enclosed grip by the left-hand of the lord of love, manmatha
  himself!
'51': >-
  Your right-eye, which is of the nature of the Sun, gives birth to the Day;

  and your left eye, which is of the nature of the lord of the night, 

  the Moon, creates Night-Time! Your third-eye, which shines like a
  golden-lotus, 

  and which is of the nature of the Fire, causes the Twilight periods in-between
  Day and Night!
'52': >-
  The glory of your glance, wins over the glory of all the major cities, 

  because of its many qualities of being all-pervasive(vishAlA),
  bestowing-prosperity(kaLyANI), 

  being invincible(ayodhyA), being a stream of compassion(dhArA), being utterly
  sweet(madhurA), 

  bestowing-pleasure(bhogavatikA), and bestowing-protection(avantI), 

  and hence is worthy of being praised by the very names of all these seven
  cities!
'53': >-
  Your two honey-bee like eyes are covering the span between your ears, 

  ever eager in relishing the honeyed praises of your poet-devotees that enter
  your ears! 

  Looking at these two eyes immersed in this joy of the nine-rasas, 

  your third eye seems to have turned slightly red out of jealousy!
'54': >-
  O Mother! Your glance which is erotic towards lord shiva, which is filled with
  contempt 

  towards anyone who isn't shiva, which is filled with anger towards gangA, 

  which is filled with astonishment towards the deeds of lord girIsha, which is
  filled with fear 

  towards the great-serpents adorning hara, which is filled with triumph over
  the beauty of a lotus, 

  and which is filled with happiness towards your companions, 

  that glance is filled with compassion towards Me!
'55': >-
  O Goddess, who is the crown-jewel of the lineage of the King of Mountains!

  these two eyes of yours adorned with eyelashes that extend until your ears, 

  looking like the wings of garuDa himself, are capable of disturbing the
  profound stillness 

  in the mind of lord shiva, who won over the three-cities! These two eyes which
  are stretched 

  across the span of your ears, hold the playfulness of the very bow of the lord
  of love, smara!
'56': >-
  O Consort of lord IshAna! These three eyes of yours marked with the darkness 

  of kAjal(coryllium), radiate with the nature of three distinct colours,

  as if they have undertaken the task of creating the cosmic trinity of brahmA, 

  viShNu, and shiva, out of their three qualities of rajas, sattva and tamas,
  once again!
'57': |-
  O Goddess who is ever immersed in the thoughts of lord pashupati!
  With your three compassionate eyes of the nature of Red, White and Black, 
  you cause the three holy streams of gangA, yamunA and sarasvatI 
  and also their confluence, with an intention to purify us!
'58': >-
  O Daughter of the King of Mountains! The pious ones say 

  that the world is dissolved and created by the closing and opening of your
  eyes!

  With the opening of your eyes, this entire creation sprang forth from
  nothingness, 

  and I suspect that you have now given up blinking in order to protect us!
'59': >-
  O Goddess aparNa! Astounded at your beautiful-eyes that are ever-awake, 

  the shapharika-fish, stay within the water with their eyes ever-open!

  Even the very Goddess of riches, abandons the water-lilies at dawn, causing
  them to close, 

  and only enters them at night, making them blossom!
'60': >-
  O Goddess shivA! Shower your long, freshly blossomed lotus-like glance upon 

  this distanced and destitute Me, with compassion! This devotee of yours shall
  be blessed 

  by this act, and there is no harm done to you in this process, just as the
  Moon 

  is impartial in his benevolence be it over a palace or over the wilderness!
'61': >-
  O Daughter of the King of Mountains! Who is not reminded of the playfulness of
  manmatha's bow, 

  on seeing your pair of arched ridges between the eyes and the
  ears(pALI-yugaLam)!?

  This is because, your long side-glances across the ridges reaching up to your
  ears 

  give the impression of an arrow mounted on a bow-string!
'62': >-
  I feel, that your face, adorned with a pair of ear-rings and their reflection 

  in your glistening cheeks, resemble the very chariot of manmatha!

  Mounted on that chariot which is verily this earth, with the Sun and the Moon
  as its wheels, 

  which is readied for a battle against shiva, the lord of the pramatha-gaNas, 

  the valiant manmatha goes to war!
'63': >-
  O Consort of lord sharva! As you relish with your ears, the hymns chanted 

  by Goddess sarasvatI, which outshine the sweetness of even a torrent of
  elixir, 

  as you nod your head in appreciation, the tinkling sounds made by your
  ear-rings 

  seem to outshine the sweetness of those hymns themselves!
'64': >-
  O Banner of the lineage of the Snowy-Mountain! May your nose, 

  resembling a tender-bamboo staff, make our desires fruitful! 

  As it carries within it the coolest free breeze of inhalation and exhalation, 

  it is also adorned on the outside with a nose-ring, studded with a white
  pearl!
'65': >-
  O Goddess with beautiful rows of teeth! Of your naturally red lips, 

  I say, that the only possible comparison is if a naturally red-coral bore
  fruit!

  The usual poetic comparison of a red bimba-fruit, which gets its redness 

  only by the reflection of other ripening fruits, 

  why is it not ashamed to be even compared to a fraction of your beauty!
'66': >-
  Constantly relishing the sweet-bright-light of your smiling moon-like face, 

  the tongues of the chakora birds grew numb! That is why to regain their taste
  buds, 

  they occasionally relish the sour-tasting moon-light during the nights, 

  thinking that it is sour-gruel!
'67': >-
  Incessantly praising the glory of your husband, 

  your tongue which has acquired the reddish tinge of a japA-flower, may it be
  victorious!

  Because of this phenomenon, the pure-crystal-white form of devI sarasvatI 

  who is situated at the tip of your tongue, has also acquired a reddish glow!
'68': >-
  Defeating the daityas in battle, and then setting aside their crowns, and
  armours, 

  but still deprived of lord shiva's garlands in praise, since they have been
  promised 

  to chaNDa in perpetuity, your children, kumAra, indra and viShNu approach you!

  And O Mother! When you feed them the beetel-leaves from your own mouth, the
  small crystals 

  of pure-white-camphor which remained in them, are then crushed and digested by
  them! 
'69': >-
  As Goddess sarasvatI was playing her vINA, named vipanchI, and singing the
  glories 

  of lord pashupati, when you started appreciating it with the nods of your
  head, 

  and your words of praise, the sweetness of your words overshadowed the sounds
  of the vINA-strings, 

  and out of embarrassment, Goddess sarasvatI started hiding the vINA with the
  hem of her saree!
'70': >-
  Touched by the tips of the fingers of himavAn, the Snowy-Mountain, due to his
  affection for his child;

  lifted up by girIsha, the lord of the mountain, with an intention to drink
  repeatedly from your lips;

  held by shambhu, like one would hold a mirror to one's face!

  O Daughter of the Mountain! How shall we describe the beauty of your chin,
   which has no worthy comparison!?
'71': >-
  Due to being in the constant embrace of the arms of lord shiva, 

  your neck with its hairs risen, resembles the beauty of a thorny tender-stalk
  of a lotus! 

  The necklace of pearls below it, which is white by its own nature, 

  but has been darkened by the application of fragrant agaru-paste, 

  makes this resemblance with a lotus-stalk in muddy waters even more
  prominent! 
'72': >-
  O Goddess who has a unique expertise of the rhythm and the flow of music, 

  the three folds on your neck are indicative of the number of knots tied 

  with the mangaLa-sUtra at the time of marriage! They shine forth, 

  as if representing the positions, and guidelines of music, which are three
  grAmas, 

  out of which various sweet rAgas spring forth!
'73': >-
  The lotus-born brahmA, with his four faces, sings the praise of the beauty 

  of your four lotus stalk-like arms! It is because he is afraid of the terrible
  nails of lord shiva, 

  the vanquisher of andhakAsura, who ripped of his fifth head once before, and
  therefore wishes 

  to have your four hands granting protection over the rest of his four heads!
'74': >-
  O Goddess umA! Pray tell us, how we can ever describe the splendour of your
  hands, 

  which, being lit up with the radiance of your nails, laugh at the meagre
  beauty 

  of the freshly blooming lotuses! Alas! Perhaps a lotus may bear at least some
  comparison 

  to their beauty, if the red-dye on the feet of the playful Goddess lakShmI
  gets smeared onto them!

  O Goddess! May your lactating pair of breasts which feed both lord skanda 
  and lord gaNesha at once, remove all our miseries!
  At the sight of them, the amusing child-gaNesha, with his baby-elephant face, 
  confused, starts checking the bulges of his own forehead with his trunk!
'76': >-
  O Banner of the King of Mountains! There is no doubt in our minds 

  that these pair of breasts of yours are two jewel-encrusted vessels that are
  filled 

  to the brim with the elixir of immortality, drinking from which, both gaNesha
  and skanda, 

  have remained as children even until today, without knowing the pleasures of
  sexual union!
'77': >-
  O Mother! The place between your breasts carries a beautiful necklace of pure
  white pearls, 

  which resemble the bulges on the forehead of the mighty gajAsura, 

  and which reflect within them the reddish hue of your lower-lip, making it
  shine 

  like the glorious valour of lord shiva, smeared with the blood of the
  vanquished tripurAsura!
'78': >-
  O Daughter of the King of Mountains! It seems to me, that the milk from your
  breasts 

  flows generously from your heart, like an unending ocean of milk, 

  and like the richness of poetic brilliance! Provided by you out of your
  compassion, 

  this child born between the three oceans, having relished it, 

  gave birth to beautiful poetry among the best of the poets! 
'79': >-
  With his body covered in the encircling flames of lord hara's rage, 

  manmatha dove into the deep-lake of your navel!

  Out of this arose gentle columns of smoke, and O Mother! Your children came to
  know this 

  as a series of fine hairs rising above your navel!
'80': >-
  O Goddess shivA! This pattern which is finer than the subtle ripples of river
  yamunA, 

  located on your slender midriff, seems to those of great-intellect, 

  as if the very space between your rounded breasts, unable to bear the friction
  between them, 

  is crumbling and falling into the depths of your navel!
'81': >-
  O Daughter of the Mountain! Glory be to your indescribable navel, 

  which seems like a steady whirlpool on river gangA; which seems like the pot
  out of which 

  your subtle pattern of hair rises up like a vine, blossoming into the flowers
  of your breasts;

  which seems like the vedic altar into which the very lord of flowery-arrows,
  manmatha is offered;

  which seems like the pleasure house of his wife, ratI devI;

  and which seems to lord shiva's eyes like the entrance of a cave of
  attainments!
'82': >-
  O Daughter of the Mountain! O Pinnacle of womanhood! May well-being always
  happen 

  to your midriff, which seems like the tree on a river-bank that is about to
  break,

  as it is already slender, and on top of it, is slightly curved 

  as it supports the weight of your bosom!
'83': >-
  O Goddess! As manmatha was creating your form, when your pair of golden
  vessel-like breasts 

  started to sweat, rubbing against your arms, drenching the drapes that cover
  you, 

  in order to save your slender waist from giving up, he added three more folds
  to your waist, 

  which seem like three rounds of the cardamom vine!
'84': >-
  O pArvati! Your father, the Mountain-King, took properties of heaviness and
  expansiveness 

  from his own being, and granted them to you as a parting-sum during marriage!

  And hence, your heavy hips, carry upon them this endless expanse of creation,
  as a tiny child!
'85': >-
  O Daughter of the Mountain! Having won over the beauty of the trunks of lordly
  elephants, 

  and of the golden tree-trunks of banana trees, with both your thighs, 

  you also have won over the mighty temples of the lordly-elephant, airAvata, 

  with your well-rounded knees, which have hardened as you bow down to your
  husband, lord shiva!
'86': >-
  O Daughter of the Mountain! In order to defeat rudra, manmatha, who usually
  carries 

  five arrows, made both your shins into his quiver, doubling his arrows into
  ten!

  This is so because, at the base of your shins, one can see your feet, 

  with ten arrow-heads like toe-nails, which seem to be sharpened 

  by the very crowns of the suras who bow down to you!

  Glory of Her Feet
'87': >-
  O Mother! Your pair of feet, which even upaniShads, the essence of the vedas, 

  wear as a crown, please place them upon my head as well, out of your
  compassion!

  It is the water that washes these feet, which flows along the matted hairs 

  of lord pashupati, as river gangA; and it is the red-dye that decorates these
  feet, 

  which is the brightness of the ruby adorning lord hari's chest!

  Charm of Her Feet
'88': >-
  We sing the prayers of these charmingly beautiful pair of feet of yours, 

  which are smeared with shining red-dye! It is desiring the touch of these
  feet, 

  that the lord of creatures, IshAna, feels jealous of the ashoka trees 

  that you tread upon in your graden!

  Impact of Her Feet
'89': >-
  When your husband made an error and referred to you by the name of gangA, 

  and bowed his head in shame, and when you struck him on his forehead with your
  lotus-like feet, 

  immediately, manmatha, who resides in your feet, and who was once reduced to
  ashes 

  by his enemy, lord shiva, let out a burst of laughter, 

  in the form of the tinkling of the series of bells on your anklets! 

  Uniqueness of Her Feet
'90': >-
  There's the lotus which shrivels up in the snow, and there are your feet 

  which are skilled in treading the snow-capped-mountains! There's the lotus
  which sleeps in the night, 

  and there are your feet which shine even in the darkest of the night! There's
  the lotus which is held 

  by the grace of the Goddess of wealth, lakShmI, and there are your feet 

  which grant even the utmost of riches to your devotees! O Mother! What is
  surprising in the fact 

  that the pair of your feet win over the splendour of a lotus!?

  Tenderness of Her Feet
'91': >-
  O Goddess! How is it that your feet, which are worthy of utmost-praise, 

  which grant ultimate abode, and which remove all obstacles, 

  are compared by the pious ones with something as hard as a tortoise-shell in
  their poetry!

  How is it that these gentle pair of feet have been placed on top of the hard 

  grinding stone during marriage ritual by the cruel-hearted lord shiva!

  Benevolence of Her Feet
'92': >-
  O chaNDi! Your pair of feet, with their crescent moon-shaped toe-nails,

  which makes the lotus-like palms of the celestial women fold in prayer;

  and which grant utmost of riches immediately to even the most destitute of
  beings;

  seem to be mocking in laugher, at the celestial tree, kalpavRkSha,

  which has the tender leaves as the tips of its hands, and

  which grants the fruits of well-being to those who are already well-to-do!

  Becoming a Bee at Her Feet
'93': >-
  May the life within me, with its six components of intent and action, 

  take the form of a dragon-fly and immerse me into your feet,

  which are like a bouquet of shining mandAra-flowers;

  which emanate immensely beautiful nectar of various virtues;

  and which eternally grant riches according to the desires, of those who are
  destitute!
'94': >-
  With an intention to get started with the art of a graceful gait, 

  the royal swans slip and slide, failing to follow your footsteps!

  Therefore, O Goddess of Virtuous Deeds! Your lotus-like feet seem to be making
  a jingling sound, 

  from a series of radiant bells adorning your anklets, as if teaching them a
  rhythm to follow!  
'95': >-
  Your attendants brahmA, hari and rudra have taken on the form of your seat!

  shiva assumed the form of a pure white blanket on top of it, 

  under the guise of offering you protection! And under the reflection of the
  redness 

  of your own radiance, the shRngAra-rasa seems to have taken on a personified
  form 

  and is causing utmost pleasantness to the eyes!
'96': >-
  Crooked in the shape of her hair, but straight forward in her nature, with a
  gentle smile;

  Soft like a flower in her heart, but as hard as the grinding stone 

  in the rounded shape of her breasts; Highly slender at her midriff, 

  but heavily endowed at the hips and breasts; In order to protect the world, 

  may this reddish-compassionate feminine aspect of lord shambhu be ever
  victorious!
'97': |-
  With the dark spot on the moon as kastUrI, the orb of the moon as the goblet 
  that holds perfumed water, and the phases of the moon as camphor crystals, 
  the jewel-encrusted container that is used for your service, is equipped!
  As you relish these every single day, and as the container empties, 
  lord brahmA replenishes it gradually once again, resulting 
  in the waning and waxing phases of the moon! 
'98': >-
  You being the consort of the lord who vanquished tripurAsura, 

  the service, and worship of your feet is not easy to beget to those of simple
  deeds!

  That is exactly why these indra and other deities, who simply stand watch 

  at the entrace of your abode, were still able to gain utmost attainments 

  like aNimA and others!
'99': >-
  Have countless poets not had the fortune of being the lords of knowledge, 

  in the form of sarasvatI, the consort of brahmA!? Who would not become the
  lord of riches, 

  even with little wealth, in the form of lakShmI, the consort of viShNu!?

  But O Goddess satI! O Foremost of Consorts! Apart from lord mahadevA, 

  it is extremely difficult for even a mere kuravaka tree to have you in
  embrace!
'100': >-
  Those who know the Agamas describe you in various ways, as the consort of lord
  brahmA, 

  as the consort of lord viShNu, as a co-born of lord hara, and as the daughter
  of the mountain!

  O Queen of the Very Source of Creation! You perplex the entire universe, 

  as the embodiment of the fourth state of turIya, which is of unfathomable 

  and boundless grace, in the form of mahAmAyA!
'101': >-
  The waters that have washed your feet smeared with red-dye and turned into a
  reddish-hue, 

  O Mother! Tell me when I, your ardent seeker, shall get to relish them!

  With its natural property of even turning a mute into an accomplished poet, 

  when shall it reach my tongue, and acquire the nature 

  of the beetel-juice of Goddess sarasvatI's mouth!
'102': >-
  O Goddess! The one who worships you, 

  shall sport with the very wives of brahmA and viShNu, Goddesses sarasvatI and
  lakShmI!

  Such a person with an enticing form, shall even slacken the chastity 

  of ratI devI, the consort of manmatha! Endowed with a long life, and breaking
  free 

  of all bondages, such a person shall relish the essence of utmost bliss!
'103': >-
  We make an offering of nIrAjana, with lit lamps to the very source of day, the
  Sun;

  an offering of arghya, by pouring droplets of water, to the one who births
  nectar, the Moon;

  and attempt to please the ocean by offering its own waters back unto itself!

  Similarly, O Mother! With the power of speech and with vocabulary, 

  which you have bestowed, this is a praise unto your own self!
'104': >
  Thus, saundaryalaharI, composed by shrI shankarabhagavatpAda, 

  who is the wandering mystic, in the tradition of guru
  shrIgovindabhagavatpAda, 

  is complete.
