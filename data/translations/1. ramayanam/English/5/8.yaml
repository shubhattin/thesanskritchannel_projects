  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa, begins the Eighth
  Sarga, called “The Description of the Puṣpaka (Vimāna).”
'1': >-
  Standing within the midst of that palace, the wise Hanumān—the son of the
  Wind-god, the foremost of monkeys—beheld a mighty aerial car (vimāna), inlaid
  and variegated with gems and precious stones, fashioned with latticed work as
  though of molten Jāmbūnada gold.
'2': >-
  That wondrous craft, whose workmanship was beyond measure and whose excellence
  could scarcely be matched, was made, as one might say, by Viśvakarmā himself
  with perfect skill; and, poised in the path of the wind and rising toward the
  heavens, it shone there like the splendor of the sun’s own course.
'3': >-
  There was nothing in it that was not wrought with deliberate effort; there was
  nothing in it that was not as of most costly jewels. Such particular
  excellences are not fixed even among the celestials; in that vimāna there was
  nothing that was not of extraordinary and surpassing distinction.
'4': >-
  It seemed attained through austerity, self-restraint, and valor; it appeared
  to move in accordance with the collectedness of the mind, as though guided by
  inner contemplation. It was fashioned with many kinds of forms and special
  constructions, and again and again wrought with equal and matching excellences
  in every part.
'5': >-
  It was swift-going once the mind was set upon it, hard to approach or
  withstand, moving with the speed of the wind. It was like a noble dwelling of
  delight—an abode fit for great-souled ones, doers of merit, possessed of great
  prosperity, and illustrious in fame.
'6': >-
  Resting upon unique and special foundations, it rose in a wondrous mass,
  adorned with many pinnacles. It was pleasing to the mind, pure and stainless
  like the autumn moon; like a mountain peak it appeared—like the famed
  Citrakūṭa, with its variegated summit.
'7': >-
  There, by it, flew through the sky night-rangers (rākṣasas) of great appetite,
  whose faces were beautified with earrings; and in their thousands moved
  companies of mighty, swift beings, with broad eyes—eyes rolled and opened
  wide, fierce and striking in their gaze.
'8': >-
  Lovely to behold with heaps of spring blossoms, and fair to see as the spring
  season itself, there the foremost vimāna named Puṣpaka was seen by that best
  of heroic vānaras (Hanumān).
'9': >-
  Thus ends the Eighth Sarga, called “The Description of the Puṣpaka (Vimāna),”
  in the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic
  (Ādi-kāvya).
