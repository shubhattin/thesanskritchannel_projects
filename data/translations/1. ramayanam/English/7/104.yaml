  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-fourth sarga, called “The Narration of the Grandsire’s Words.”
'1': >-
  “Hear, O King of great might, for what purpose I have come. I have been sent
  by the Grandsire, the divine one, O exceedingly powerful lord.”
'2': >-
  “In former times I was brought forth by you, O hero, conqueror of hostile
  cities, as your son—Kāla, the all-gathering Time—called into being by your
  māyā.”
'3': >-
  “And the blessed Grandsire himself, the Lord, the sovereign of the worlds,
  spoke: ‘A covenant has been made by you, gentle one, to guard and protect the
  worlds.’”
'4': >-
  “Formerly, having drawn the worlds together and compressed them by your own
  māyā, while you lay upon the waters in the great ocean, it was you who first
  produced me.”
'5': >-
  “Thereafter, by your māyā you produced Ananta, the serpent endowed with hoods,
  reclining upon the waters; and you also brought forth two beings of mighty
  strength—”
'6': >-
  “Madhu and Kaiṭabha; and by the heap of whose bones this earth—the
  broad-bosomed land—became hemmed in with mountains and constrained by ranges.”
'7': >-
  “Then, having brought forth even me from the divine lotus, radiant like the
  sun, from your navel, you entrusted to me all the Prajāpati’s work—the whole
  task of creation.”
'8': >-
  “Therefore I, having laid down my burden, worship you, O Lord of the universe.
  Do you ordain protection for all beings; you are the increaser of my
  splendour.”
'9': >-
  “Then you too, from that ancient, eternal state—being irresistible—assumed the
  condition of Viṣṇuhood for the protection of all beings.”
'10': >-
  “As the valiant son born of Aditi, you became the increaser of your brothers’
  prowess; and when tasks arise, you are appointed to be their aid.”
'11': >-
  “You—best of the worlds—when the peoples were being terrified, and desiring
  the slaying of Rāvaṇa, directed your mind toward taking birth among men.”
'12': >-
  “Having yourself, in earlier time, fixed by your own Self the term of your
  dwelling—ten thousand years and ten hundreds of years—”
'13': >-
  “You, that mind-born son, complete in lifespan among men here—this Time has
  now approached, O best of men, to draw near to you (for its fulfillment).”
'14': >-
  “If, O great king, you still desire to continue attending upon and ruling your
  subjects, then dwell on, O hero—good be to you.’ Thus spoke the Grandsire.”
'15': >-
  “Or else, O Rāghava, if your wish is for conquest of the world of the gods,
  then let the gods, supported by Viṣṇu, become free from fevered distress.”
'16': >-
  Hearing the words spoken by the Grandsire, urged on by Time, Rāghava, smiling,
  spoke a reply to that All-destroying (Time).
'17': >-
  “Having heard the supremely wondrous speech of the God of gods, a great joy
  has arisen in me because of your coming.”
'18': >-
  “For the sake of the work of all the three worlds was my birth. Blessings be
  upon you; I shall go back to the very place from which I came.”
'19': >-
  “Since you have come and reached me, there is no deliberation for me in that
  matter. For in all undertakings I must stand in accord with the gods who are
  subject to my will, O All-destroying Time—just as the Grandsire has spoken.”
'20': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-fourth sarga of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the revered
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Narration of the Grandsire’s
  Words.”
