  Now begins, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-third sarga, called “The Coming of Kāla (Time).”
'1': >-
  Then, after some time had passed, while Rāma remained steadfast in dharma,
  Kāla (Time) came to the royal gate in the guise of an ascetic.
'2': >-
  He spoke these words to Lakṣmaṇa, who was resolute and renowned: “Announce me
  to Rāma, for I have arrived, bearing the weight of an important matter.”
'3': >-
  “I am the messenger of the exceedingly mighty great sage of immeasurable
  energy. I have come desiring to see Rāma, O mighty one, for indeed I have a
  task to accomplish.”
'4': >-
  Hearing his speech, Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), filled with haste, informed Rāma that
  the ascetic had arrived.
'5': >-
  “Victory to you, O Rāma—by dharma may you conquer both worlds, O greatly
  radiant one. A messenger, shining like the sun through austerity, has come to
  see you.”
'6': >-
  Hearing the words spoken by Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma said: “Let the sage enter, dear
  one—the great-spirited bearer of that message.”
'7': >-
  Then Saumitri, saying, “So be it,” ushered the sage within—one blazing indeed
  with his own splendors, as though scorching with his rays.
'8': >-
  Approaching the best of the Raghus, the seer, kindling by his own radiance,
  addressed Rāghava in a sweet voice, saying, “Prosper and flourish.”
'9': >-
  To him, the mighty-radiant Rāma offered reverent hospitality, beginning with
  the arghya-offering, and then, undistracted, began to inquire after his
  welfare.
'10': >-
  Questioned about his welfare by Rāma, that foremost of speakers, the greatly
  illustrious one, sat down upon a divine golden seat.
'11': >-
  Thereupon Rāma said to him: “Welcome to you, O great sage. Declare the message
  and the words for which purpose you have come as a messenger.”
'12': >-
  Urged by the lion among kings, the sage spoke these words: “This is a
  confidential matter that must be spoken; it is indeed for your good—if you
  desire it.”
'13': >-
  “Whoever hears it or even looks upon it shall become liable to be slain by
  you—if you would uphold the word of the foremost of sages.”
'14': >-
  Rāma, having pledged, “So be it,” then said to Lakṣmaṇa: “Stand at the door, O
  mighty-armed one; dismiss the door-keeper.”
'15': >-
  “Indeed, he must be slain by me—whoever might see or hear this secret
  discourse being spoken between the sage and me, O Saumitri.”
'16': >-
  Then the son of Kakutstha stationed Lakṣmaṇa as guard at the door, and said to
  the sage: “Speak, O sage,” thus spoke Rāghava.
'17': >-
  “Whatever speech you have in mind, and for which you have become thus
  intent—tell it without hesitation. It is present in my heart as well.”
'18': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-third sarga of the Uttarakāṇḍa in the holy
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, called “The Coming of Kāla (Time).”
