  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa,
  begins the forty-ninth sarga, named “Rāma’s Dejection (Rāma-nirveda).”
'1': >-
  Bound fast by a dreadful net of arrows, the two sons of Daśaratha lay
  there—heaving long breaths like mighty serpents—stretched upon the ground and
  drenched with blood.
'2': >-
  All those foremost of vānaras, together with the exceedingly powerful Sugrīva,
  stood encircling the two great-souled brothers, overwhelmed and inundated with
  grief.
'3': >-
  Meanwhile, Rāma, the valiant one, returned to awareness; for through
  steadfastness and the discipline of inner strength, he endured, even though
  his body was lashed and held together, as it were, by the arrows.
'4': >-
  Then, seeing his brother lying there, stained with blood, sunk down and deeply
  transfixed, his face fallen in misery, Rāma, stricken with anguish, lamented
  aloud.
'5': >-
  “What use is Sītā to me—what use is life itself, even if she be recovered—when
  today I behold my brother lying defeated upon the battlefield?”
'6': >-
  “A woman like Sītā may indeed be found again by searching in the world of
  mortals; but a brother like Lakṣmaṇa—my companion and minister, my helper even
  for the final journey—cannot be found again.”
'7': >-
  “I shall relinquish my life before the very eyes of the vānaras, if the
  joy-increasing son of Sumitrā has gone to the state of the five elements (to
  death).”
'8': >-
  “What shall I say to Kauśalyā? What shall I say to my mother Kaikeyī? And how
  shall I face mother Sumitrā, longing to see her son?”
'9': >-
  “Bereft of her calf, trembling—trembling like a kurarī-bird—how shall I
  console her, if I return without him?”
'10': >-
  “How shall I speak to Śatrughna, and to the illustrious Bharata: ‘He went to
  the forest together with me, yet I have come back without him’?”
'11': >-
  “I shall not be able to endure the reproach of mother Sumitrā. Here itself I
  shall abandon this body; for I have no strength to go on living.”
'12': >-
  “Fie upon me—of evil deeds, ignoble—because for my sake Lakṣmaṇa has fallen
  and lies upon a bed of arrows, like one already bereft of life.”
'13': >-
  “Ever do you console me when I am cast down, O Lakṣmaṇa; yet today, with life
  departed, you are not able to speak to me in my distress.”
'14': >-
  “You by whose might many rākṣasas today were slain upon the earth in
  battle—today you, that very hero, lie here, slowly brought low.”
'15': >-
  “Lying upon this bed of arrows, with blood streaming forth, you appear as
  though made into an arrow yourself—like the sun going down to its setting.”
'16': >-
  “Because your vital spots have been struck by arrows, you are unable to speak
  here; and the gaze of him who would speak is indicated by pain, fixed and
  piercing.”
'17': >-
  “Just as that great-lustrous one followed me when I went to the forest, so too
  shall I now follow him, even to Yama’s imperishable abode.”
'18': >-
  “He—beloved of kinsmen always, and ever devoted in following me—has today
  reached this condition because of my ignoble conduct and evil policy.”
'19': >-
  “I do not recall that from the heroic Lakṣmaṇa—though he might be angered—any
  harsh or disagreeable word was ever spoken at any time.”
'20': >-
  “He who would discharge, in a single swift effort, five hundred
  arrows—Lakṣmaṇa was superior in missile-weapons even to Kārtavīrya.”
'21': >-
  “He who could, with weapons, strike down even the weapons of great-souled
  Śakra (Indra)—he now lies slain upon the earth, though worthy of the costliest
  and noblest of beds.”
'22': >-
  “That false speech of mine will surely burn me, without doubt—that I did not
  make Vibhīṣaṇa king of the rākṣasas.”
'23': >-
  “At this very moment, Sugrīva, you ought to withdraw from here and return; for
  thinking me weakened, Rāvaṇa will overpower you, O king.”
'24': >-
  “With Aṅgada placed at the fore, with the army and all its equipment, cross
  the ocean, O Sugrīva, together with Nīla and Nala.”
'25': >-
  “A very great deed has been accomplished—what would be difficult for others in
  battle. I am satisfied with the lord of bears, and with the ruler of the
  long-tailed monkeys as well.”
'26': >-
  “The deed done by Aṅgada, and by Mainda and Dvivida; and the terrible battle
  wrought in the fight by Kesarin and by Sampāti—(all this is known to me).”
'27': >-
  “By Gavaya, by Gavākṣa, by Śarabha, by Gaja, and by other vānaras too—who for
  my sake entered battle having renounced their very lives—combat was waged.”
'28': >-
  “Nor can fate, O Sugrīva, be transgressed by human beings. Yet whatever could
  be done by a friend, by a well-wisher, or by one dear to me—you have done to
  the utmost.”
'29': >-
  “All that has been done, O Sugrīva, has indeed been done by you, who are
  fearful of adharma. The duty of a friend has been fulfilled by you, O bull
  among vānaras.”
'30': >-
  “All of you are released by me; you may go, each according to his wish.” Thus
  did all the vānaras hear his lamentation.
'31': Then those dark-eyed vānaras let tears stream forth from their eyes.
'32': >-
  Thereafter Vibhīṣaṇa, having stationed all the divisions of the army, came
  swiftly to the place where Rāghava was, mace in hand.
'33': >-
  Seeing him coming quickly, like a mass of dark collyrium, all the vānaras
  fled, taking him to be Rāvaṇa’s son.
'34': >-
  Thus ends the forty-ninth sarga, called “Rāma’s Dejection,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
