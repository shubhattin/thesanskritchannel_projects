  Now begins the ninety-second sarga in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Treatment of Lakṣmaṇa Wounded by the Weapons
  of Rāvaṇa’s Son (Indrajit).”
'1': >-
  But Lakṣmaṇa—of auspicious marks—his limbs smeared and drenched with blood,
  became elated, having in battle slain that foe, the conqueror of enemies in
  the field.
'2': >-
  Then that mighty-armed, great-splendoured hero, approaching Jāmbavān and
  Hanūmān, and assembling with them all those forest-dwellers (the Vānaras) as
  well,
'3': >-
  went swiftly to the place where Sugrīva and Rāghava were, leaning for support
  upon Vibhīṣaṇa and also upon Hanūmān.
'4': >-
  Thereupon, drawing near to Rāma and bowing to him, Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) stood
  close by his brother—like Indra’s younger brother standing near Indra.
'5': >-
  Then that valiant one, as though roaring, came and reported to the
  great-souled Rāghava the dreadful slaying of Indrajit.
'6': >-
  And Vibhīṣaṇa, delighted, then announced to Rāma that the head of Rāvaṇa’s son
  had been cut off by great-souled Lakṣmaṇa.
'7': >-
  Hearing indeed of Indrajit’s death at Lakṣmaṇa’s hands, the great hero (Rāma)
  attained immeasurable joy and spoke these words:
'8': >-
  “Well done, Lakṣmaṇa! I am pleased. A deed hard to accomplish has been
  accomplished. By the destruction of Rāvaṇa’s son, know it as—Victory has been
  secured.”
'9': >-
  Then the mighty Rāma kissed Lakṣmaṇa—whose fame was thus increased—on the
  head; and though Lakṣmaṇa was bashful, out of affection he lifted him forcibly
  into his lap.
'10': >-
  Setting him upon his thigh and embracing him—though he was in pain—Rāma again
  and again looked upon his dear brother Lakṣmaṇa.
'11': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa—pierced by darts and tormented by the pain of the weapons—kept
  heaving deep sighs; and Rāma, scorched with sorrow, beheld him oppressed by
  those very sighs.
'12': >-
  Kissing him on the head, and once more touching him, the best of men (Rāma),
  hastening to comfort him, spoke these words to Lakṣmaṇa:
'13': >-
  “A supremely auspicious deed has been done by you, performer of difficult
  deeds. Today, I deem that with that son slain, Rāvaṇa himself has been slain
  in battle.”
'14': >-
  “Today I am victorious over the enemy, since that wicked one has been slain by
  you, O hero, in battle—Rāvaṇa the cruel—by good fortune.”
'15': >-
  “For his right arm has been cut off—he who was his support. A great deed in
  battle has been accomplished by Vibhīṣaṇa and Hanūmān as well.”
'16': >-
  “In three days and nights the hero has, somehow, been brought down. Today I
  have been made free of foes; surely Rāvaṇa will now come forth (to battle).”
'17': >-
  “Surely Rāvaṇa, with a vast battle-array, will come forth—having heard that
  his son has been struck down—(coming) with a great battle-array.”
'18': >-
  “That lord of the rākṣasas—scorched by grief at his son’s death—when he comes
  forth, hard to overcome, I shall slay him, hemming him in with a mighty
  force.”
'19': >-
  “With you, Lakṣmaṇa, as my protector, Sītā and the earth (the kingdom) are not
  hard for me to regain, now that he has been slain—he who in battle was a
  conqueror even of Śakra (Indra).”
'20': >-
  Thus comforting his brother and embracing him, Rāghava—Rāma—glad at heart,
  addressed Suṣeṇa and spoke as follows:
'21': >-
  “O greatly wise one, Saumitri, who is devoted to friends, must be made free
  from the darts. Attend upon him in such a way that he becomes completely
  well.”
'22': >-
  “Let Saumitri be made dartless quickly—together with Vibhīṣaṇa—and (likewise
  attend) to the heroes of the armies of bears and monkeys, those warriors who
  fight with trees.”
'23': >-
  “And whatever others are fighting here—wounded and with darts still in
  them—let all of them too, with effort, be made well by you.”
'24': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, that great-souled leader of the monkey-host, Suṣeṇa,
  gave Lakṣmaṇa a supreme medicine for the nose (to be inhaled).
'25': >-
  Smelling its fragrance, he became free of darts; and at once he became also
  free from pain, and his wounds were healed and knit together.
'26': >-
  Then, by Rāghava’s command, he also undertook the treatment of the
  friends—beginning with Vibhīṣaṇa—and of all the foremost monkeys.
'27': >-
  Then Saumitri, having returned to his natural state, the darts removed,
  fatigue gone, rejoiced there; in a moment his fever too had departed.
'28': >-
  Then Rāma, the lord of the monkeys, Vibhīṣaṇa, and the mighty lord of the
  bears—seeing Saumitri risen up, free from illness—rejoiced greatly, along with
  their forces, for a long while.
'29': >-
  The great-souled son of Daśaratha extolled that exceedingly difficult deed of
  Lakṣmaṇa; and the lord of the monkeys became delighted in battle on hearing
  that conqueror of Śakra (Indrajit) had been laid low.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-second sarga in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the sacred
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Treatment of Lakṣmaṇa Wounded
  by the Weapons of Rāvaṇa’s Son.”
