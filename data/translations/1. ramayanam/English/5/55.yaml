  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-fifth chapter, named “Hanumān’s Delusion (Confusion).”
'1': >-
  Beholding Laṅkā—the city blazing on every side, with the troops of rākṣasas
  terrified and thrown into panic—Hanumān, the monkey, began to ponder.
'2': >-
  Then a very great dread arose in him, and self-reproach was born within him:
  “While burning Laṅkā, what is this deed that has been done by me?”
'3': >-
  Blessed indeed are those great-souled ones who, by their understanding,
  restrain the anger that has arisen—like quenching a blazing fire with water.
'4': >-
  Who, when enraged, would not commit sin? When enraged, one might even strike
  one’s elders; when enraged, a man might assail holy and righteous persons with
  harsh speech.
'5': >-
  When inflamed with wrath, one does not at any time discern what should be
  spoken and what should not be spoken. For one who is angry, there is no
  forbidden act; and nowhere does there remain anything that ought not be said.
'6': >-
  He who casts away the anger that has leapt up, by forbearance alone—just as a
  serpent sloughs off its worn-out skin—he is truly called a man (a real
  person).
'7': >-
  Shame on me—of utterly perverted judgment, shameless, a doer of sin—who,
  without considering Sītā, became a giver of fire, a slayer of my own master’s
  purpose!
'8': >-
  If this entire place has been burned, surely the noble lady Jānakī too has
  been burned. By me—who did not understand—my lord’s purpose has been ruined.
'9': >-
  That very task for whose sake this undertaking was begun—that task has been
  brought to ruin. For while I was burning Laṅkā, Sītā was not protected by me.
'10': >-
  This work was almost accomplished—indeed, it had been accomplished, without
  doubt. But by me, overcome by anger, its very root has been destroyed.
'11': >-
  Surely Jānakī has perished; for not a single unburnt region is seen anywhere
  in Laṅkā. The whole city has been reduced to ashes.
'12': >-
  If that task has been thwarted by me through the perversion of my judgment,
  then even here, this very day, relinquishing my life appeals to me as well.
'13': >-
  Shall I fall today into fire? Or into the mare-faced submarine flame? Or shall
  I give this body to the creatures that dwell in the ocean?
'14': >-
  How could I, while still living, be able to behold the lord of monkeys
  (Sugrīva)—or those two tiger-like men (Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa)—I, who have
  destroyed the very entirety of their mission?
'15': >-
  Truly, this very thing has been displayed by me due to the fault of wrath—this
  fickle, unsteady “monkey-nature,” notorious in the three worlds.
'16': >-
  Shame on this passionate disposition—helpless and unstable—through which I,
  even while serving a mighty lord, through attachment and impulsive delight,
  did not protect Sītā.
'17': >-
  If Sītā has been destroyed, then those two also will perish. And upon their
  destruction, Sugrīva too, together with his kinsmen, will perish.
'18': >-
  Hearing only this report, how will Bharata—devoted to his brothers,
  righteous-souled—together with Śatrughna, be able to continue living?
'19': >-
  When the Ikṣvāku line—so devoted to dharma—has gone to ruin beyond doubt, all
  the people will become afflicted with grief and burning sorrow.
'20': >-
  Therefore I—bereft of good fortune, cut off from the acquisition of dharma and
  artha, my self overcome by the fault of wrath—am clearly a destroyer of the
  world.
'21': >-
  As he thus reflected, omens presented themselves to him—those that had been
  perceived earlier; and he considered them again, directly and carefully.
'22': >-
  Or else—since she is lovely-limbed—she has been protected by her own spiritual
  splendor. The auspicious lady will not perish; fire does not act upon fire.
'23': >-
  For the wife of that righteous-souled one (Rāma), of immeasurable radiance—she
  who is guarded by her own pure conduct—the Fire-god has no right to touch her.
'24': >-
  Surely, by the power of Rāma, and by the merit of Vaidehī, it is because of
  that that the bearer of oblations (Agni) did not burn me, though I was engaged
  in the act of burning.
'25': >-
  She who is, as it were, the very deity of the three brothers beginning with
  Bharata, and who is dear to Rāma’s heart—how could she perish?
'26': >-
  Or again: if this Fire—whose very function is burning—is everywhere powerful
  and imperishable, and yet does not burn my tail, then how would he burn the
  noble lady?
'27': >-
  And again Hanumān, astonished there, reflected—remembering the manifestation
  of the mountain called Hiraṇya-nābha, displayed in the midst of waters.
'28': >-
  By austerity, by truthfulness of speech, and by exclusive devotion to her
  husband—she would rather burn even fire itself; fire will not burn her.
'29': >-
  While he was thus reflecting there upon the देवी (Sītā) and her steadfast
  adherence to dharma, Hanumān then heard the words of great-souled Cāraṇas
  (heavenly bards).
'30': >-
  “Ah! A deed has indeed been done by Hanumān—hard to fathom—who, in the
  dwelling of the rākṣasas, released a fierce and dreadful fire.”
'31': >-
  “Laṅkā, filled with rākṣasa women, children, and the aged who have fled in all
  directions—shaken by the uproar of the populace—cries out, as though the
  mountain-caves themselves were wailing.”
'32': >-
  “This city Laṅkā has been burned—together with its ramparts, walls, and
  gateways; yet Jānakī has not been burned: this is truly our wondrous
  amazement!”
'33': >-
  Hanumān heard that speech, like nectar; and at that very moment, joy arose in
  his heart.
'34': >-
  And by those omens he had seen that confirmed the matter, by the strong and
  worthy reasons, and by the words of seers, Hanumān’s mind became filled with
  gladness.
'35': >-
  Then the monkey—his desired purpose attained—knowing the king’s daughter
  (Sītā) to be uninjured, and having indeed beheld her again with his own eyes,
  resolved upon his return journey.
'36': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fifth chapter, named “Hanumān’s Delusion (Confusion),” in
  the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the original epic.
