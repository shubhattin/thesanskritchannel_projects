  Now begins the thirty-ninth sarga (chapter), named “Inquiry regarding the
  departure to the forest,” in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, and seeing him as well in the guise of an ascetic, the
  king, together with his wives, looked on—and his consciousness failed him.
'2': >-
  Afflicted with grief, he did not look back upon Rāghava; and, gazing upon him,
  that despondent king could not reply to him.
'3': >-
  The lord of the earth, as though insensible for a moment, sorrowing,
  lamented—thinking only of Rāma, the mighty-armed.
'4': >-
  “Truly I think that, in former times, I have done many deeds
  unbefitting—living beings have been harmed by me; therefore this consequence
  has come upon me.”
'5': >-
  “Life does not depart from the body before its appointed time; and for me,
  tormented by Kaikeyī, death does not come.”
'6': >-
  “I—who behold my son standing before me, radiant like fire, having cast aside
  fine garments and clothed in ascetic attire—”
'7': >-
  “For the sake of Kaikeyī alone, indeed, all these people suffer—she, intent
  upon her own advantage, taking refuge in this deceit.”
'8': >-
  Having spoken thus, his senses overwhelmed by tears, he uttered but once,
  ‘Rāma!’ and was not able to say anything further.
'9': >-
  Regaining consciousness after a moment, the king, with both eyes full of
  tears, spoke this to Sumantra:
'10': >-
  “Yoke the conveyance-chariot and come here with the best of horses; take that
  greatly fortunate one beyond the borders of this realm.”
'11': >-
  “Thus indeed is said to be the fruit of the virtues of the virtuous—that a
  noble hero is exiled to the forest by his father and his mother!”
'12': >-
  Understanding the king’s command, Sumantra—swift in action—harnessed the
  chariot adorned with horses and went there.
'13': >-
  The charioteer announced to the prince that chariot, ornamented with gold,
  yoked with excellent steeds; and, joining his palms in reverence, he reported
  it ready.
'14': >-
  Then the king quickly summoned one who was engaged in accumulating wealth—one
  who knew what was fit to place and time, resolute, and pure in every way—and
  said:
'15': >-
  “Swiftly bring garments worthy of the best, and also splendid ornaments, after
  counting them—these for Vaidehī, for the years (of exile).”
'16': >-
  So, addressed thus by the lord of men, he went to the treasury-house; and,
  having brought all of it, he delivered it at once to Sītā.
'17': >-
  That well-born Vaidehī, setting out for the forest, adorned her limbs with
  those many-colored and varied ornaments.
'18': >-
  Thus richly adorned, Vaidehī made that palace shine—like the radiance of the
  sun in the season when its rays are uplifted (bright and strong) in the sky.
'19': >-
  Embracing her with both arms, her mother-in-law spoke to the Maithilī, who was
  not behaving in a pitiable, unseemly way, and she kissed her on the head.
'20': >-
  “In this world, women are untrue: though always honored by their dear ones,
  they do not stand by their husband when he has fallen into ruin.”
'21': >-
  “This is the nature of women: having formerly enjoyed happiness, even on
  meeting with a small calamity, they become corrupted and even abandon (their
  husbands).”
'22': >-
  “They are of false conduct, distorted, difficult to fathom, ever without true
  heart; untruthful, with sinful intentions, becoming dispassionate in a mere
  moment.”
'23': >-
  “Neither lineage, nor good deeds, nor learning, nor gifts, nor careful
  provision—none of these hold a woman’s heart; for their hearts are
  impermanent.”
'24': >-
  “But for chaste women—steadfast in character, in truth, and in what they have
  heard (the teachings)—the one supreme purifier stands out: the husband alone.”
'25': >-
  “Therefore your son, who has been sent away to the forest, must not be
  despised by you. Let him be your very god—whether he is without wealth or
  possessed of wealth.”
'26': >-
  Understanding her words—fraught with dharma and purpose—Sītā, joining her
  palms, spoke thus, standing facing her mother-in-law:
'27': >-
  “I shall do everything, venerable lady, that you instruct me. I know how one
  must conduct oneself toward one’s husband; I have heard it and am
  well-informed.”
'28': >-
  “A noble lady should not compare me with the base. I am not able to swerve
  from dharma—any more than the moon’s radiance can (cease to shine).”
'29': >-
  “A vīṇā is not played without strings; a chariot does not exist without
  wheels. A woman without a husband does not flourish in happiness—even if she
  should have a hundred sons.”
'30': >-
  “A father gives in measured ways; a brother gives in measured ways; a son
  gives in measured ways. But who would not honor a husband—the giver of the
  immeasurable?”
'31': >-
  “Thus am I, foremost lady—versed in dharma from beginning to end. O noble one,
  what is there here to be slighted? For to a woman, her husband is indeed her
  divinity.”
'32': >-
  Hearing Sītā’s heart-touching words, Kauśalyā, pure of spirit, suddenly let
  fall tears—born at once of sorrow and of joy.
'33': >-
  Then Rāma, supremely righteous, looking upon her with joined palms—she being
  highly honored among the mothers—spoke this word to his mother:
'34': >-
  “Mother, do not become sorrowful as you look upon my father. The term of the
  forest-dwelling, too, will swiftly come to an end.”
'35': >-
  “While you sleep, nine years and five will pass; and then, having returned
  here in full, you will see me surrounded by friends.”
'36': >-
  Having spoken to his mother these words, whose purpose was to soothe and
  guide, he then looked upon the mothers—three hundred and fifty in number.
'37': >-
  And the son of Daśaratha, seeing those mothers likewise afflicted, spoke this
  dharma-grounded speech, with joined palms:
'38': >-
  “Whatever harshness, in any way, has occurred through living together—anything
  done even out of ignorance—understand that from me (as something to be
  forgiven); and I take leave of you all.”
'39': >-
  All those women, their minds struck down by grief, heard this speech of
  Rāghava—righteous and well-composed.
'40': >-
  Then there arose from them a great cry, like the call of female krauñcha
  birds—those queens of the lord of men—when Rāghava spoke thus.
'41': >-
  That palace of Daśaratha, which once had resounded like the roar of murajas
  and paṇavas and like thunderclouds, became filled with wailing and
  lamentation—fallen into calamity and exceedingly sorrowful.
'42': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-ninth sarga, named “Inquiry regarding the departure to
  the forest,” in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial
  epic.
