  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyākāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-fifth canto, called “The Mother’s Rite of Benediction (Svastyayana).”
'1': >-
  Then that noble-minded mother, having removed that fatigue (of grief and
  exertion), and having sipped and touched pure water for purification,
  performed auspicious rites for Rāma.
'2': >-
  “O best of the Raghu line, thou canst not be restrained; go now. Yet return
  quickly, and conduct thyself according to the righteous path of the virtuous.”
'3': >-
  “That dharma which thou dost guard with love and with disciplined
  observance—may that very dharma, O tiger among the Rāghavas, protect thee.”
'4': >-
  “And those deities and those sacred abodes whereunto, my son, thou bowest in
  reverence—may they also protect thee in the forest, together with the great
  ṛṣis.”
'5': >-
  “The weapons that were bestowed upon thee by the wise Viśvāmitra—may they ever
  protect thee, thou who art always endowed with virtues.”
'6': >-
  “By service to thy father, my son, and likewise by service to thy mother, and
  by truthfulness, O mighty-armed one—mayest thou live long, being well
  protected.”
'7': >-
  “May the bundles of sacrificial sticks, the kuśa-grass, and the holy pavitras;
  the altars and sanctuaries; the consecrated ground-spaces (sthāṇḍilas) of the
  twice-born; and the mountains, trees, shrubs, and lakes; and the birds,
  serpents, and lions—protect thee, O best of men.”
'8': >-
  “May there be welfare from the Sādhyas and the Viśvedevas, and from the Maruts
  together with the great ṛṣis. Welfare be from Dhātā and Vidhātā; welfare be
  from Pūṣan, Bhaga, and Aryaman.”
'9': >-
  “And may all the guardians of the worlds, with Vāsava (Indra) at their head;
  and the six seasons; and all the months, the years, and the nights—(be ever
  favorable to thee).”
'10': >-
  “May the days and the muhūrtas ever bring thee welfare. May Śruti and Smṛti
  and Dharma protect thee, my son, on every side.”
'11': >-
  “May the blessed god Skanda, and Soma together with Bṛhaspati; may the Seven
  Ṛṣis and Nārada—protect thee on every side.”
'12': >-
  “And may the perfected beings, and the directions on every side with their
  presiding lords—praised by me there in that forest—protect thee, my son,
  constantly.”
'13': >-
  “May all the mountains, and the oceans, and King Varuṇa himself; heaven, the
  mid-region, the earth, and the wind moving among all that is mobile and
  immobile—(guard thee).”
'14': >-
  “May all the constellations and the planets together with their deities; and
  day and night, and likewise the twilights—protect thee who hast taken refuge
  in the forest.”
'15': >-
  “And may the other six seasons, and the months and the years; and the kalās
  and the kāṣṭhās (divisions of time)—grant thee peace and well-being.”
'16': >-
  “Even as thou roamest in the great forest, thou wise one, clad in a sage’s
  guise—may both the gods and the Dānavas (Daityas) be ever givers of comfort
  unto thee.”
'17': >-
  “Of the rākṣasas and piśācas—fierce, cruel in deeds, and all flesh-eaters—let
  there be no fear for thee, my dear son.”
'18': >-
  “In the woodland, may monkeys, scorpions, gadflies, and mosquitoes; and
  creeping creatures and insects—never be in thy thickets (to trouble thee).”
'19': >-
  “May great elephants, and lions, and tigers, and bears with their fangs; and
  fierce horned buffaloes—not harm thee, my dear son.”
'20': >-
  “And those fierce kinds that feed on human flesh, and all other species
  besides—may they not injure thee, my son, having been worshipped by me here.”
'21': >-
  “May thy goings be auspicious; may thy valorous efforts attain success. Go, my
  son Rāma, endowed with welfare and with all prosperity.”
'22': >-
  “Welfare be unto thee again and again from beings of the mid-air, and from
  those upon the earth; and from all the gods—and even from those that might
  stand in thy way as adversaries.”
'23': >-
  “May Śukra, and Soma, and Sūrya; and Kubera the giver of wealth, and Yama
  likewise—being worshipped—protect thee, O Rāma, dwelling in the Daṇḍaka
  forest.”
'24': >-
  “May Agni and Vāyu, and likewise Dhūma (the deity of smoke); and the mantras
  that have issued from the mouths of the ṛṣis—protect thee, O joy of the
  Raghus, at the time of thy ritual touching of water (for purification).”
'25': >-
  “May Brahmā, lord of all worlds, the creator of beings, and the ṛṣis; and
  those remaining gods besides—protect thee, who art dwelling in the forest.”
'26': >-
  Thus that illustrious wide-eyed queen worshipped the hosts of gods with
  garlands and with perfumes, and with praises befitting them.
'27': >-
  And taking sacred fire, that great-souled brāhmaṇa performed, according to due
  rite, the oblation and invocation for Rāma’s auspicious well-being.
'28': >-
  Kauśalyā, the most excellent of women, made ready ghee, white garlands, and
  fuel-sticks, and mustard seeds as well.
'29': >-
  That preceptor, having duly offered oblations for appeasement and freedom from
  calamity, then arranged an outer bali-offering with the remainder of the
  consecrated offerings.
'30': >-
  Then, with honey, curds, rice-grains, and ghee, she caused the twice-born to
  recite blessings—performing for Rāma, in the matter of his forest-dwelling,
  the rite of svastyayana (benedictory auspiciousness).
'31': >-
  Thereafter, Rāma’s renowned mother gave that foremost of brāhmaṇas a desirable
  fee (dakṣiṇā), and then spoke this to Rāghava:
'32': >-
  “That auspiciousness which befell the thousand-eyed Indra, adored by all the
  gods, at the slaying of Vṛtra—may that be thine, as auspiciousness.”
'33': >-
  “That auspiciousness which of old was granted to Suparṇa (Garuḍa), the son of
  Vinatā, when he sought the nectar of immortality—may that be thine, as
  auspiciousness.”
'34': >-
  “In the producing of the nectar, when the wielder of the thunderbolt (Indra)
  smote the Dānavas—whatever auspiciousness Aditi bestowed—may that be thine, as
  auspiciousness.”
'35': >-
  “When Viṣṇu of incomparable splendor strode forth in his three vast strides
  (as Trivikrama)—whatever auspiciousness then was, O Rāma—may that be thine, as
  auspiciousness.”
'36': >-
  “May the ṛṣis, the oceans, the islands, the Vedas, the worlds, and the
  directions grant thee auspicious blessings—O mighty-armed one—true and
  beneficent auspiciousness.”
'37': >-
  Thus, having performed the remaining acts for her son, the fair lady placed
  them upon his head (as a blessing); and she also anointed Rāma with fragrant
  substances, she of wide eyes.
'38': >-
  And Kauśalyā made a protective charm for him, employing the auspicious herb
  that accomplishes its purpose well, the sacred ‘Viśalyakaraṇī’ (remover of
  darts and pain), and she muttered mantras over it.
'39': >-
  Then she spoke as though rejoicing, though held in the power of sorrow—only
  with words and not with the heart—her speech faltering as she spoke.
'40': >-
  Bowing down, and smelling his head, and embracing him, the illustrious queen
  said to her son: “Go, O Rāma, and attain thy desired end in comfort and
  well-being.”
'41': >-
  “May I behold thee, dear child, returning again to Ayodhyā—free from sickness,
  having accomplished every aim—established in the paths of royal duty.”
'42': >-
  With all thought of sorrow lost, her face lit up with joy’s radiance: “I shall
  behold thee returned from the forest, rising like the full moon.”
'43': >-
  “I shall behold thee again, O Rāma, come back hither from forest-dwelling,
  seated on an auspicious throne—having fulfilled thy father’s word and crossed
  beyond it.”
'44': >-
  “Returning hither from forest-dwelling, endowed with auspicious blessings, do
  thou ever increase the fulfillments of desire for me and for thy wife. Go,
  dear one.”
'45': >-
  “The hosts of gods—Śiva and the rest—together with the great ṛṣis, the
  companies of beings, the gods and nāgas, worshipped by me—may they, and the
  directions, O Rāghava, who art setting forth to the forest for a long time,
  desire and secure thy welfare.”
'46': >-
  And her eyes being exceedingly filled with tears, having completed the
  svastyayana as prescribed, she made Rāghava go around her in reverence
  (pradakṣiṇā); and again and again she looked upon him and embraced him.
'47': >-
  And Rāghava, the greatly renowned, having been made to circumambulate by that
  divine lady (his mother), repeatedly pressed and clasped his mother’s feet;
  then he went to Sītā’s dwelling, blazing with the splendor bestowed by her
  blessing.
'48': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fifth canto, called “The Mother’s Rite of Benediction
  (Svastyayana),” in the Ayodhyākāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Primeval
  Epic.
