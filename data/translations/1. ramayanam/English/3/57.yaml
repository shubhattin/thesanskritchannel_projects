  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-seventh canto, entitled “Rāma’s Return (to the hermitage).”
'1': >-
  Having slain Mārīca—the rākṣasa who, being a shape-shifter, was roaming about
  in the form of a deer—Rāma quickly turned back along the path.
'2': >-
  As he hastened on, eager to behold Maithilī (Sītā), then a cruel-voiced jackal
  howled behind his back.
'3': >-
  Recognizing the jackal’s dreadful and hair-raising cry, he reflected, troubled
  with misgiving at that sound.
'4': >-
  “Inauspicious, alas, do I deem it, the way this jackal is howling. Yet may
  there be well-being for Vaidehī—without her being devoured by the rākṣasas.”
'5': >-
  “When Mārīca, having discerned my voice and taking note of it, cried out in
  the form of a deer, if Lakṣmaṇa should hear that cry—”
'6': >-
  “—then that son of Sumitrā, hearing the voice, will abandon Maithilī; and
  being sent by her herself, he will quickly come here to my side.”
'7': >-
  “Surely, with the rākṣasas in concert, Sītā’s death is what is desired. Having
  become a golden deer, he has drawn me away from the hermitage.”
'8': >-
  “Leading me far away, Mārīca—the rākṣasa—was struck by my arrow; and then he
  uttered the words, ‘Ah, Lakṣmaṇa, I am slain!’”
'9': >-
  “May there be well-being for the two of them, left behind by me in the forest.
  For, on account of Janasthāna, I have incurred enmity with the rākṣasas.”
'10': >-
  “And many terrible portents are seen today.” Thus, thinking in this manner,
  Rāma, having heard the jackal’s cry,
'11': >-
  turned back in haste and went toward the hermitage, self-possessed—reflecting
  also on how a rākṣasa, in the guise of a deer, had drawn him away.
'12': >-
  The descendant of Raghu reached Janasthāna, filled with apprehension. To him,
  whose heart had grown despondent, came deer and birds in despondence as well.
'13': >-
  Keeping the great-souled one on their left, they sent forth dreadful cries.
  Seeing those exceedingly terrible omens, Rāghava turned back again in haste
  and, with speed, made for his own hermitage.
'14': >-
  Then he saw Lakṣmaṇa approaching, his lustre gone. Not far from Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa
  came up to him.
'15': >-
  Being distressed, he—the brother—rebuked him, the distressed one, being
  himself full of sorrow and beholding Lakṣmaṇa arrived.
'16': >-
  Having abandoned Sītā in the lonely forest, frequented by rākṣasas—then the
  delight of the Raghus (Rāma), taking Lakṣmaṇa’s left hand,
'17': >-
  spoke these words, ending in sweetness yet harsh and anguished: “Alas,
  Lakṣmaṇa! Blameworthy is the deed you have done, that you abandoned her.”
'18': >-
  “O gentle one, having come here, is there welfare for Sītā? I have no doubt, O
  hero, that in every way the daughter of Janaka—”
'19': >-
  “—has perished, or has been devoured by the rākṣasas that roam the woods,
  since inauspicious signs, for the most part, keep manifesting to me.”
'20': >-
  “O Lakṣmaṇa, tiger among men, may we yet attain the presence of Sītā—alive—the
  daughter of Janaka.”
'21': >-
  “Just as herds of deer, and the jackal too, howl frightfully, and birds also
  cry out, with the quarters all around appearing as though ablaze—may there be
  well-being for that princess, O mighty-armed one!”
'22': >-
  “For this rākṣasa, resembling a deer, lured me and led me far away as I
  followed. I slew him only with great exertion, and even then that rākṣasa
  became so only while dying.”
'23': >-
  “And my mind here is downcast and without joy, and my left eye too undergoes a
  twitching change. Without doubt, O Lakṣmaṇa, Sītā is not (safe)—either she has
  been carried off, or she is dead, or she lies somewhere upon the way.”
'24': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-seventh canto, entitled “Rāma’s Return,” in the
  Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
