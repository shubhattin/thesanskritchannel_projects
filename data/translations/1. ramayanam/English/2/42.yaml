  Now begins the Forty-second Sarga of Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Daśaratha’s Lamentation.”
'1': >-
  So long as the dust raised by him, taking the form of a cloud, was still
  visible, the best of the Ikṣvākus did not at all withdraw his gaze from it.
'2': >-
  So long as the king beheld his beloved son—Rāma, supremely righteous—so long
  did his longing (to keep looking) increase in his heart, upon seeing his son
  upon the earth.
'3': >-
  But when the lord of the earth could no longer see even that dust of Rāma,
  then, stricken with anguish and sinking down, he fell upon the ground.
'4': >-
  Kauśalyā, that noble lady, came after him on his right side with her arm about
  him; and on his other side there followed Kaikeyī, slender-waisted.
'5': >-
  Then the king—endowed with discernment, with righteousness, and with
  self-restraint—looked at Kaikeyī and spoke, his senses distressed and shaken.
'6': >-
  “O Kaikeyī, resolved upon sin, do not touch my limbs. For I do not wish to
  look upon you—neither as wife nor as kinswoman.”
'7': >-
  “And those who live dependent on you— I have nothing to do with them, nor they
  with me. You are wholly intent on selfish gain, having abandoned dharma;
  therefore I abandon you.”
'8': >-
  “As for the fact that I took your hand (in marriage), and that I led you
  around the sacred fire—of all that I give you leave, both in this world and in
  the world to come.”
'9': >-
  “Even if Bharata, having obtained this imperishable kingdom, should become
  well-disposed, and were to offer something to me for the sake of his
  father—may that which is given not come to me.”
'10': >-
  Thereupon the queen Kauśalyā, worn down by sorrow, raised up the king who was
  smeared with dust, and then led him back.
'11': >-
  The righteous-souled king grieved, as though he had slain a brāhmaṇa out of
  desire, or as though he had touched fire with his hand, continually thinking
  of his son Rāghava.
'12': >-
  As he turned back again and again, sinking on the ruts of the chariot-track,
  the king’s appearance lost its splendour, like the sun when it is seized by a
  cloud.
'13': >-
  Tormented with grief, he lamented, remembering his beloved son. And when he
  understood that his son had reached the outskirts of the city, he spoke thus:
'14': >-
  “On the road are seen the footprints of the foremost of vehicles bearing my
  son; but that great-souled one himself is not to be seen.”
'15': >-
  “He who used to lie down at ease upon cushions, anointed with sandal, fanned
  by my most excellent women—my best of sons—”
'16': >-
  “—he indeed, somewhere today, taking refuge under the root of a tree, will lie
  down placing a piece of wood, or else a stone, as his pillow.”
'17': >-
  “He will rise up from the ground, wretched, covered with dust, breathing
  hard—like a bull-elephant among she-elephants at a watering place.”
'18': >-
  “Men who live in the forest will surely see Rāma of long arms, rising and
  going forth— the lord of the world, yet as though without a protector.”
'19': >-
  “Sītā, surely beloved daughter of Janaka, accustomed to the comfort of
  splendid couches, will today go to the forest, wearied by stepping on thorns.”
'20': >-
  “Unacquainted with forests, she will surely be overtaken by fear, hearing the
  deep, hair-raising cries of wild beasts.”
'21': >-
  “Be it so, Kaikeyī—fulfil your desire; dwell in the kingdom as a widow. For
  without that tiger among men, I do not have the strength to live.”
'22': >-
  Thus lamenting, the king, surrounded by a great crowd of people, entered the
  best of palaces like one who has encountered an ill-omen without having
  performed the proper rites after bathing.
'23': >-
  He entered that city whose squares and courtyards were empty, whose shops and
  altars of trade were shut, weary and weakened, distressed with grief, and
  whose great roads were not crowded as before.
'24': >-
  Beholding the entire city thus, thinking only of Rāma, the king entered his
  house lamenting—like the sun entering a mass of clouds.
'25': >-
  The palace, bereft of Rāma, of Vaidehī, and of Lakṣmaṇa, was like a great
  lake, unagitated and still, after a serpent has been carried off by Suparṇa
  (Garuḍa).
'26': >-
  Then, with voice choked and faltering, lamenting, the lord of the earth spoke
  gently words that were indistinct in meaning, pitiable, and toneless.
'27': >-
  “Quickly lead me to the house of Kauśalyā, Rāma’s mother; for nowhere else
  will there be any comfort for my heart.”
'28': >-
  As the king spoke thus, the doorkeepers led him to Kauśalyā’s residence there,
  and placed him within it, as one would do with due reverence.
'29': >-
  Then, after he had entered Kauśalyā’s dwelling, even after mounting the bed,
  his mind became restless and shattered.
'30': >-
  The king beheld the palace bereft of the two sons and also devoid of the
  daughter-in-law, like the sky when the moon is lost.
'31': >-
  Seeing that, the mighty, valiant great king raised up his arm and cried aloud
  in a high voice, “Ha, Rāma! Have you abandoned us?”
'32': >-
  “Happy indeed for that time will those best of men live, who, embracing Rāma,
  will behold him returned again.”
'33': >-
  Then, when night had come—like the Night of Doom to his very self—at midnight
  Daśaratha spoke this to Kauśalyā:
'34': >-
  “I do not see you, Kauśalyā. Touch me with your hand, gently. My sight has
  followed after Rāma, and even now it does not return.”
'35': >-
  Seeing the lord of men upon the bed, absorbed in thinking of Rāma alone, the
  queen drew near and sat beside him; herself more deeply afflicted in
  appearance, and heaving heavy sighs, she lamented with great difficulty and
  pain.
'36': >-
  Thus ends the Forty-second Sarga of Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “Daśaratha’s Lamentation.”
