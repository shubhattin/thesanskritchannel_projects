  Now begins, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the
  five-hundred-and-fifth sarga, entitled “The Coming of Durvāsas.”
'1': >-
  While those two were thus conversing, the Blessed sage Durvāsas, desirous of
  seeing Rāma, approached the royal gateway.
'2': >-
  Having come up to him, the most excellent of sages spoke to Saumitri
  (Lakṣmaṇa): “Show me Rāma at once; my purpose brooks no delay.”
'3': >-
  Hearing the sage’s words, Lakṣmaṇa—slayer of heroes on the enemy’s side—bowed
  reverently to that great soul and then spoke these words.
'4': >-
  “Tell me, O Blessed one, what is the business? What is the matter? What shall
  I do? For Rāghava is engaged, O Brahman; wait but a short while.”
'5': >-
  Hearing that, the tiger among sages, his mind darkened by wrath, spoke to
  Lakṣmaṇa, as though burning him with his eyes.
'6': >-
  “This very moment, Saumitri, announce me to Rāma! This very moment,
  Saumitri—if you do not announce me…
'7': >-
  …then I shall curse you, your realm and city, and so also Rāghava; and Bharata
  too, Saumitri, and whatever progeny may be yours.”
'8': >-
  “For I shall not be able any longer to hold this anger within my heart.”
  Hearing those words of that great soul, dreadful in their import, he pondered
  in his mind the inevitable consequence of that utterance.
'9': >-
  “Let there be the death of one—let there not be the destruction of all.”
  Having resolved thus in his understanding, he informed Rāghava.
'10': >-
  On hearing Lakṣmaṇa’s message, King Rāma dismissed Kāla and, coming out
  swiftly, beheld Atri’s son (Durvāsas).
'11': >-
  Bowing to that great soul, blazing as it were with splendour, the son of
  Kakutstha spoke with folded hands: “What is the purpose?”
'12': >-
  Hearing the words spoken by Rāghava, the excellent sage Durvāsas answered the
  lord Rāma: “Listen, O lover of dharma.
'13': >-
  “Today is the completion of a thousand years of my austerities. Therefore I
  desire food—properly prepared—O sinless one.”
'14': >-
  Hearing this speech, King Rāghava, his heart pleased, caused food—duly
  prepared—to be brought for the foremost of sages.
'15': >-
  And the best of sages, having eaten that food, like unto nectar, addressed
  Rāma with “Well done, Rāma,” and departed to his own hermitage.
'16': >-
  When that excellent sage had gone to his hermitage, Lakṣmaṇa’s elder brother
  (Rāma), recalling the words of Kāla, then fell into sorrow.
'17': >-
  Tormented exceedingly by grief, remembering that fearful vision, he remained
  with downcast face and despondent mind, and was unable to speak.
'18': >-
  Then Rāghava, having determined in his mind the words spoken by Kāla, and
  deciding, “This cannot be otherwise,” remained silent, that highly renowned
  one.
'19': >-
  Thus ends the five-hundred-and-fifth sarga of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the holy
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Coming of Durvāsas.”
