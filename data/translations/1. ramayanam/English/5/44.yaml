  Now, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Sundara-kanda, begins the
  forty-fourth canto, called “The Slaying of Jambumali.”
'1': >-
  Commanded by the lord of the rakshasas, the mighty Jambumali—son of Prahasta,
  great-fanged and bearing a bow—came forth.
'2': >-
  Wearing a garland of red and clad in red raiment, adorned with a floral wreath
  and charming ear-ornaments, with large, wide-rolling eyes—fierce and
  unconquerable in battle—he advanced.
'3': >-
  He brandished a bow resembling Indra’s rainbow, along with great and splendid
  arrows, and as he stretched it with speed, it resounded like the thunderbolt
  and the crash of lightning.
'4': >-
  By that mighty twang of his bow, the quarters and the intermediate directions,
  and even the sky itself, were suddenly filled.
'5': >-
  Seeing him approaching in a chariot yoked with asses, Hanuman, swift in speed,
  rejoiced and roared aloud.
'6': >-
  Jambumali, the great-armed one, pierced Hanuman—the great monkey stationed
  upon the projection of the gateway—with sharp-pointed arrows.
'7': >-
  With one half-moon-headed shaft he struck his face; with one barbed arrow he
  struck his head; and with ten iron darts he pierced the lord of monkeys in
  both arms.
'8': >-
  His copper-hued face, struck by an arrow, shone forth—like a lotus blossomed
  in autumn, pierced by the sun’s rays.
'9': >-
  That face of his, reddened with blood upon blood, gleamed—like a great lotus
  in the sky sprinkled with drops of sandal-paste.
'10': >-
  Wounded by the rakshasa’s arrows, the great monkey was enraged; then, at his
  side, he beheld a huge, massive rock.
'11': >-
  With great force the powerful one tore it up and hurled it; enraged, the
  rakshasa struck that rock with ten arrows.
'12': >-
  Seeing that deed of his thwarted, Hanuman, of fierce prowess, tore up a broad
  sala tree and began to whirl it about, mighty in strength.
'13': >-
  Seeing the monkey whirling the huge sala tree, Jambumali, of great might, shot
  forth very many arrows.
'14': >-
  With four arrows he cut the sala tree asunder; with five he pierced the
  monkey’s arms; with one arrow he struck his head; and with ten he smote him in
  the region of the chest.
'15': >-
  His body filled with arrows, encompassed by tremendous wrath, he seized that
  very (tree-trunk) as a club and whirled it about with speed.
'16': >-
  Having whirled it with exceeding speed—terrible in strength—he brought the
  club down upon Jambumali’s mighty chest.
'17': >-
  Then, there were seen neither his head, nor his arms, nor even his knees;
  neither his bow nor his chariot nor his horses were to be seen there, nor even
  his arrows.
'18': >-
  Thus Jambumali, of great might, was swiftly slain by him and fell down upon
  the earth, his limbs and ornaments crushed to fragments.
'19': >-
  Hearing that Jambumali and the mighty Kinkaras had been slain, Ravana became
  enraged, his eyes reddened with wrath.
'20': >-
  That lord of night-rangers, his copper-red eyes inflamed and rolling with fury
  at the death of Prahasta’s mighty son, swiftly commanded the sons of his
  ministers—men of exceeding valor and prowess.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the forty-fourth canto of the Sundara-kanda in the revered Valmiki
  Ramayana, the primordial epic, entitled “The Slaying of Jambumali.”
