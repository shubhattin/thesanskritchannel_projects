  Now begins the Sixty-Third Canto in the Kishkindha Kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Regrowth of Sampāti’s Wings.”
'1': >-
  Thus, with these and many other words, Sampāti—skilled in speech—praised me;
  and, having granted me leave, he entered his own abode.
'2': >-
  Then, creeping out from the cavern, I slowly and gradually ascended Mount
  Vindhya and waited there for you.
'3': >-
  Today, of this time, a full hundred years and more have passed. I have been
  awaiting the proper place and time, keeping the sage’s words fixed within my
  heart.
'4': >-
  When I had resolved upon the great departure (from life), and the moon had
  gone down, anguish scorched me—surrounded by countless anxious deliberations.
'5': >-
  When the thought of death arose, I restrained it by the sage’s words—the
  understanding that he bestowed upon me for the preservation of my life-breath.
'6': >-
  That understanding removes my sorrow, as a blazing flame of fire dispels
  darkness; and by that discernment I also came to know the prowess of the
  wicked-souled Rāvaṇa.
'7': >-
  “When the son (Rāvaṇa) has been rebuked with words, how can Maithilī not be
  rescued?” Hearing her lamentation—and seeing those two (Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa)
  separated from Sītā—
'8': >-
  there did not arise in me any affection produced by fondness for Daśaratha
  toward his son. While he (Rāma) thus spoke, and while the monkeys stood
  together around him,
'9': >-
  then, before the very eyes of those forest-dwellers, wings sprang forth. He,
  seeing his own body with wings that had risen, having tawny-red feathers,
'10': >-
  obtained incomparable delight; and he spoke this to the monkeys: “By the grace
  of the moon—of the royal sage, of immeasurable splendor—
'11': >-
  my wings, which had been scorched by the rays of the Sun, have appeared again.
  The valor that was mine in youth—
'12': >-
  that very strength and manliness I perceive today once more. Therefore, by all
  means let effort be made; you shall succeed in discovering Sītā.
'13': >-
  ‘This gaining of wings by me is for you a cause of confidence in success.’
  Having said this to all those monkeys, Sampāti, best of birds,
'14': >-
  leapt up from the peak of the mountain, wishing to test his course of flight.
  Hearing his words, the tiger-like heroes among monkeys became gladdened at
  heart, facing toward the rise of valor and enterprise.
'15': >-
  Then those foremost of monkeys—whose prowess was like the wind, who had
  regained their manliness—set out toward the quarter facing Abhijit, intent on
  the quest for Janaka’s daughter (Sītā).
'16': >-
  Thus ends the Sixty-Third Canto in the Kishkindha Kāṇḍa of the ancient,
  sacred, glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, named “The Regrowth of
  Sampāti’s Wings.”
