  Now begins the forty-second sarga in the Kishkindha-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, entitled “The Dispatch to the Western Quarter.”
'1': >-
  Then Sugriva, having sent forth the monkeys toward the southern direction,
  addressed a vanara named Sushena, who was like a rain-laden cloud in
  appearance.
'2': >-
  The king—Tara’s father, his own father-in-law, of dreadful prowess—approached
  with joined palms, bowed in reverence, and spoke these words.
'3': >-
  (He spoke to) Maricha, the son of a great seer—radiant, a mighty monkey,
  surrounded by brave and heroic foremost of monkeys, and shining with splendor
  like Mahendra (Indra).
'4': >-
  Endowed with intelligence and valor, resplendent like Vainateya (Garuda), and
  to the powerful sons of Marichi—those Marichas, luminous and garlanded—
'5': >-
  to all those rishi-born leaders he assigned the western direction, along with
  two hundred thousand monkeys, O foremost of monkeys.
'6': >-
  “You, led by Sushena, search for Vaidehi (Sita): (search) Saurashtra together
  with the Bahlika lands, and also the regions called Chandrachitra.”
'7': >-
  “(Search) prosperous and delightful provinces, and vast and ancient cities;
  (search) the mountain-hollow thick with the punnaga-groves and crowded with
  bakula and uddalaka trees.”
'8': >-
  “And search also the thickets of ketaka, O leaders among monkeys; and (search)
  the auspicious rivers with cool waters that flow westward (against the
  current).”
'9': >-
  “(Search) the forests of ascetics, and those wilderness-mountains; there are
  plains that are largely desert-like, and exceedingly lofty rocks cold with
  snow.”
'10': >-
  “Having searched the western quarter—difficult of approach, covered with
  networks of mountains—then, having come to the far west, you should behold the
  ocean.”
'11': >-
  “the monkeys will sport also in coconut-groves; and there you must search for
  Sita and also for the abode of Ravana.”
'12': >-
  “In mountains and forests lying upon the ocean’s shore; and also (search) the
  town called Muravi, and the lovely city called Jatapura.”
'13': >-
  “(Search) Avanti, Angalepa, and likewise the forest known as ‘Unmarked’; and
  the vast kingdoms and the cities encountered here and there.”
'14': >-
  “And at the confluence of the River Sindhu and the ocean there is a great
  mountain named Somagiri, with a hundred peaks and mighty trees.”
'15': >-
  “On its delightful slopes stand lions that move as swiftly as birds; they even
  place the bodies of timi, fish, and elephants up in their nests.”
'16': >-
  “Those nests of the lions that are set upon the mountain-peaks—and the proud,
  sated elephants too, whose roar is like the rumbling of rain-clouds—”
'17': >-
  “wander all about on that vast (mountain), filled with waters on every side.
  Its summit, which touches the heavens, is golden and adorned with wondrous
  trees.”
'18': >-
  “All this must be swiftly explored by the monkeys, who can assume forms at
  will; and there is a golden coast of the ocean extending a hundred yojanas.”
'19': >-
  of fire-like radiance, fearsome, and able to assume forms at will—like tongues
  of flame—gathered together on every side.”
'20': >-
  “They should not be approached too closely by the monkeys of dreadful prowess;
  and no fruit of any kind from that land should be taken by the monkeys.”
'21': >-
  “For those heroes are hard to assail—possessed of great strength and power;
  they, of terrible valor, guard the fruits and roots there.”
'22': >-
  “Yet effort must be made there, and Janaki must be sought; for there is no
  fear from them for those who keep to their monkey-nature (and do not provoke
  them).”
'23': >-
  “There is also the great mountain named Vajra, appearing like the hue of
  vaidurya (lapis/beryl), set firm in adamantine formation, strewn with diverse
  trees and creepers.”
'24': >-
  “Glorious, it rises there to an even hundred yojanas; the caves there must be
  carefully searched with utmost exertion, O monkeys.”
'25': >-
  “In the fourth quarter of the ocean is a mountain named Chakravan; there a
  thousand-spoked discus was fashioned by Vishvakarman.”
'26': >-
  “There, having slain Panchajana and also the danava Hayagriva, the Supreme
  Person (Vishnu) bore away that discus and the conch as well.”
'27': >-
  “On its pleasant ridges and within its broad caves, Ravana together with
  Vaidehi must be searched for, again and again, in every place.”
'28': >-
  “For sixty-four yojanas there is a mountain named Varaha, very great, with
  golden peaks, in the unfathomable abode of Varuna (the ocean).”
'29': >-
  “There is a city called Pragjyotisha, made of gold, wherein dwells the
  wicked-souled danava named Naraka.”
'30': >-
  “On its pleasant ridges and within its broad caves, Ravana together with
  Vaidehi must be searched for, again and again, in every place.”
'31': >-
  “Passing beyond that lord of mountains, whose appearance is tinged with gold,
  (you will see) a mountain wholly golden, abounding in streams and waterfalls.”
'32': >-
  “There elephants, boars, lions, and tigers on every side continually roar,
  made proud by that very sound.”
'33': >-
  “On that mountain named Megha, the illustrious Mahendra—Paka’s chastiser—was
  consecrated by the gods as their king.”
'34': >-
  shining like the young sun, radiant on every side, adorned with golden trees
  in full bloom.”
'35': >-
  “In their midst stands the king of mountains, Meru, the supreme peak—once
  granted a boon by the gracious Sun.”
'36': >-
  “Thus addressed, that lord of mountains (Meru)—all of whom are under your
  shelter—shall, by my favor, become golden by day and by night.”
'37': >-
  “And those also who dwell upon you—gods, gandharvas, and danavas—shall become
  devoted, their splendor golden-hued by that radiance.”
'38': >-
  stand in attendance upon the Sun; and the Sun, worshipped by them, becomes
  unseen to all beings as he goes to rest behind the mountain.”
'39': >-
  “The Sun-god traverses those ten thousand yojanas swiftly, reaching that
  mountain-range in half a muhūrta.”
'40': >-
  “Upon its peak is a vast divine palace, resembling the Sun, crowded with
  multitudes of mansions, constructed by Vishvakarman.”
'41': >-
  “Adorned with wondrous trees, filled with many kinds of birds, it is the
  dwelling of the great-souled Varuna, who bears the noose in his hand.”
'42': >-
  “Between Meru and the setting mountain is a great palmyra (tala) called
  Dashashira—made of gold, glorious, and shining with wondrous terraces.”
'43': >-
  “In all those strongholds, in lakes, and in rivers—there, again and again,
  Ravana together with Vaidehi must be searched for.”
'44': >-
  “There dwells one who knows dharma, matured by his own austerities—this sage,
  called Merusavarni, famed as equal to Brahma.”
'45': >-
  “That great seer Merusavarni, sun-like in splendor, should be
  questioned—having bowed with the head to the ground—about news concerning
  Maithili (Sita).”
'46': >-
  “Thus far, at the end of night, the Sun, having made all the world free of
  darkness, goes to set behind the mountain.”
'47': >-
  “So far are the monkeys able to go, O leaders among monkeys; beyond that we do
  not know—sunless, without boundary, and unmeasured.”
'48': >-
  “Having ascertained Vaidehi and also the dwelling of Ravana, reach the setting
  mountain and return when a month is completed.”
'49': >-
  “You must not stay beyond a month; one who remains would become liable to be
  slain by me. Along with you my valiant father-in-law will go.”
'50': >-
  “All this must be hearkened to by you, who execute what is commanded. This
  mighty-armed one is my guru—my father-in-law, of great strength.”
'51': >-
  “And you too are all courageous, and all are indeed men of authority;
  establishing him as your authority, proceed to behold the western direction.”
'52': >-
  “When the wife of the king of immeasurable splendor has been seen (and found),
  we shall have accomplished our purpose, having rendered requital for what has
  been done (for us).”
'53': >-
  “Therefore, whatever further task is to be done that would be dear to the
  fulfillment of this mission—consider it, with due regard to place, time, and
  purpose.”
'54': >-
  “Then those monkeys, with Sushena at their head, having heard Sugriva’s
  skillful words, took leave of the lord of monkeys, and went to that quarter
  guarded by Varuna (the western region).”
'55': >-
  “Thus ends the forty-second sarga in the Kishkindha-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Adi-Kavya, entitled ‘The Dispatch to the Western Quarter.’”}]}
