  Then, in the sacred and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa,
  begins the five-hundred-and-fifth sarga, entitled “Rāma’s Speech.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, while those lion-like men, surrounded by their companies of
  well-wishing friends, continued to grieve, that night passed away in sorrow.
'2': >-
  When the night had ended and the dawn had auspiciously arisen, those brothers,
  encircled by their friends, having performed on the Mandākinī the prescribed
  offerings and the recitation of sacred prayers, approached Rāma.
'3': >-
  Seated there in silence, none of them spoke a single word; but Bharata, in the
  midst of his friends, addressed Rāma with speech.
'4': >-
  ‘My own mother has been appeased, and this sovereignty has been given to me;
  I, for my part, give that very kingdom to you alone—enjoy the realm, free from
  thorns, free from trouble.’
'5': >-
  ‘As a causeway is broken by a great rush of waters when the floods come, so is
  this vast portion of sovereignty hard to restrain or manage by anyone other
  than you.’
'6': >-
  ‘As a donkey cannot keep pace with a horse, or as a bird cannot follow the
  course of Tārkṣya (Garuḍa), so I am not able to follow your course, O king of
  the earth.’
'7': >-
  ‘Truly, for him who lives by others, life is easy and ever supported; but for
  him who makes others live by him, O Rāma, life is hard indeed.’
'8': >-
  ‘Just as a tree planted by a man and carefully tended grows into a great
  tree—its trunk well established—yet is hard to climb for one of short
  stature,’
'9': >-
  ‘so too, if it blossoms yet yields no fruits, it does not give that
  satisfaction to him for whose sake it was planted.’
'10': >-
  ‘This is the simile, O mighty-armed one; you should understand its meaning: if
  you, like a bull among men, are our master and supporter, then do not leave
  these dependents unsustained.’
'11': >-
  ‘Let the guilds and all the foremost men, O great king, behold you established
  in the kingdom, a crusher of foes, blazing like the sun in splendor.’
'12': >-
  ‘In your retinue, O scion of Kakutstha, let the intoxicated elephants trumpet;
  and let the women within the inner apartments rejoice, composed and tranquil.’
'13': >-
  Hearing Bharata’s words as he thus entreated Rāma, the diverse citizens
  thought, ‘Indeed, this is right and fitting.’
'14': >-
  Seeing him thus afflicted—lamenting, renowned though he was—Rāma,
  self-controlled and steady-minded, consoled Bharata with a composed heart.
'15': >-
  “A man does not act solely by his own desire; this person is not independent.
  From this side and that, Fate drags him onward.”
'16': >-
  “All accumulations end in depletion; all elevations end in falling; all unions
  end in separation; and life ends in death.”
'17': >-
  “As ripe fruits have no fear except falling, so a man who is born has no fear
  except death.”
'18': >-
  “As a house with firm, thick pillars, when it becomes old, sinks and
  collapses, so too do men sink, having come under the power of age and death.”
'19': >-
  “That night which passes does not return again; and the Yamunā, full and
  swelling with waters, goes on only toward the ocean.”
'20': >-
  “Days and nights pass for all creatures here; swiftly they consume their spans
  of life, as in summer the sun’s rays drink up water.”
'21': >-
  “Grieve for your own self—why do you grieve for another? For the life of him
  whose time is passing diminishes, whether he stands still or moves.”
'22': >-
  “Death goes along with a man; with him death sits down. Having traveled a very
  long road, death alone turns back (while the man does not).”
'23': >-
  “Wrinkles appear upon the limbs and the hairs of the head turn white; when a
  man is worn down by age, what can he do to display power or vigor?”
'24': >-
  “Men rejoice when the sun rises; they rejoice when the luminary sets; they do
  not take note of the wasting away of their own life.”
'25': >-
  “They delight on seeing the continual arrival of ever-new seasonal festivals;
  yet by the succession and turning of the seasons, the life-breath of beings is
  diminished.”
'26': >-
  “As one log and another may meet together upon the great ocean and, meeting,
  then part again when time comes,”
'27': >-
  “so wives and sons, kinsmen and wealth come together and then scatter apart;
  separation from them is inevitable and certain.”
'28': >-
  “Here no living being meets with things exactly as he wishes them to be;
  therefore, in that matter there is no power in grieving for one who has
  departed.”
'29': >-
  “As when a caravan is going, a man standing on the road might say, ‘I too
  shall come behind you,’”
'30': >-
  “so this path has certainly been gone by the forefathers—ancestral and
  paternal—before us. Having reached that path, how can one grieve over what
  cannot be transgressed?”
'31': >-
  “As one’s age falls away and as a river’s stream does not turn back, one
  should apply oneself to well-being; the subjects are remembered as those who
  deserve happiness.”
'32': >-
  “Our father, the lord of the earth, righteous-souled, has gone to heaven, his
  sins washed away, by means of all auspicious deeds and sacrifices fully
  completed with their due priestly fees.”
'33': >-
  “By properly supporting his servants, by protecting the people, and by giving
  wealth in accordance with dharma, our father has gone to the third heaven.”
'34': >-
  “By auspicious and cherished works and by sacrifices completed with the proper
  gifts, Daśaratha—our father, the king—has attained heaven.”
'35': >-
  “Having worshipped by many kinds of sacrifices, and having obtained abundant
  enjoyments, and having reached an excellent span of life, the lord of the
  earth has gone to heaven.”
'36': >-
  “Having attained an excellent lifespan, and enjoyments too, that father of
  ours, O dear one, is not one to be lamented—gone to heaven and honored by the
  virtuous.”
'37': >-
  “Casting off his worn-out human body, our father has attained divine
  prosperity, moving and dwelling in the world of Brahmā.”
'38': >-
  “A wise man should not lament one who has reached such a state—especially one
  like him, and also one who is learned and of discerning intellect.”
'39': >-
  “These many kinds of sorrows—wailing and weeping likewise—should indeed be
  avoided by the steadfast, by the intelligent, in every condition of life.”
'40': >-
  “Therefore, be composed; do not grieve. Go and dwell in that city—thus were
  you appointed by our father, the self-controlled one, best of speakers.”
'41': >-
  “And where I too was appointed by that same father of meritorious deeds,
  there, in that very place, I shall carry out the command of my noble father.”
'42': >-
  “It is not proper for me to abandon his command, O subduer of enemies; and so
  it should ever be honored by you as well—he is our kinsman; he is our father.”
'43': >-
  “That word of our father—righteous in conduct—approved and sanctioned (by
  dharma), I shall fulfill by my action, namely by dwelling in the forest, O
  Rāghava.”
'44': >-
  “A man should be such—firm in dharma, compassionate, obedient to elders—O
  tiger among men—if he seeks to conquer the world beyond.”
'45': >-
  “You too abide by your own self, according to your nature, O bull among men,
  having considered the auspicious conduct of our father Daśaratha.”
'46': >-
  Having spoken thus—those meaningful words—for the sake of fulfilling his
  father’s command, the mighty lord Rāma, after a short while, ceased (speaking)
  to his younger brother.
'47': >-
  Thus ends the five-hundred-and-fifth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “Rāma’s Speech.”
