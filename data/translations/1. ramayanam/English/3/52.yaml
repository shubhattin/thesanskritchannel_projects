  Now begins the fifty-second canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Sītā’s Lamentation.”
'1': >-
  But Sītā—whose face was like the moon, the lord of the stars—having seen that
  king of vultures lying slain by Rāvaṇa, lamented bitterly, overwhelmed with
  grievous sorrow.
'2': >-
  An omen, a portent, a dream, the sight or cry of a bird—some such sign is
  surely seen by men, foretelling both happiness and misery.
'3': >-
  Surely, O Rāma, thou dost not know the great calamity that hath befallen thee.
  Indeed, O Kakutstha, for my sake, beasts and birds are running about in
  agitation.
'4': >-
  For this bird, moved by compassion, came hither to rescue me; but now, by my
  ill fortune, he lies slain upon the earth.
'5': >-
  “Deliver me today, O Kakutstha! O Lakṣmaṇa!”—thus cried aloud that fair-limbed
  lady, exceedingly terrified, wailing so that those who were near might hear.
'6': >-
  Seeing Vaidehī thus—her garlands and ornaments disordered, lamenting like one
  without refuge—Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, ran swiftly towards her.
'7': >-
  As she clung like a creeper, twining about and embracing great trees, and
  cried again and again, “Release me! Release me!”, the lord of rākṣasas came
  upon her.
'8': >-
  Crying “Rāma! Rāma!” in that forest, bereft of Rāma, she was seized by her
  hair for the ending of her life by him who was like Death itself.
'9': >-
  When Vaidehī was thus violated and overpowered, the entire world with all that
  moves and all that is immovable became as though lawless, and was enveloped in
  blinding darkness.
'10': >-
  There the wind did not blow; the Sun became bereft of splendour—when the god
  (the Sun), with his divine sight, beheld Sītā being laid hands upon.
'11': >-
  Then the glorious Grand-sire (Brahmā) spoke, saying, “The task is
  accomplished.” And all those great ṛṣis were both delighted and distressed.
'12': >-
  Beholding Sītā being seized, the dwellers of the Daṇḍaka forest, understanding
  as it were by chance that Rāvaṇa’s destruction had now been secured, (looked
  on with a grave foreboding of his end).
'13': >-
  But Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, taking her up, went into the sky—her who was
  crying “Rāma! Rāma!” and also “Lakṣmaṇa!”
'14': >-
  Wearing yellow silken cloth, her limbs radiant like heated gold, the princess
  shone like a flash of lightning in the sky.
'15': >-
  And with her yellow garment blown up by the wind, Rāvaṇa shone all the more,
  like a mountain blazing with fire.
'16': >-
  From that supremely auspicious Vaidehī, lotus-petals—ruddy and fragrant—were
  scattered upon Rāvaṇa.
'17': >-
  Her silken robe, tossed aloft into the sky, gleaming like gold, appeared in
  the sunshine like a copper-coloured cloud, tinged by the Sun’s redness.
'18': >-
  Her stainless face, set upon Rāvaṇa’s lap in the sky, did not shine without
  Rāma—like a lotus without its stalk.
'19': >-
  It was as though the Moon had risen after cleaving a dark-blue cloud—her
  forehead fair, the ends of her hair beautiful, her face like the heart of a
  lotus, and without blemish.
'20': >-
  Adorned with white and very pure teeth, radiant with lustre—thus was her
  fair-eyed face in the sky upon Rāvaṇa’s lap.
'21': >-
  Bathed in tears, her face wiped again and again, lovely to behold like the
  Moon—her nose well-shaped, her lips charming and copper-red—shone in the sky
  with a golden radiance.
'22': >-
  That auspicious face of hers, shaken by the lord of rākṣasas, shone not
  without Rāma—like the Moon risen in daytime.
'23': >-
  Golden-hued Maithilī, leaning upon that dark-limbed lord of rākṣasas, shone
  like a golden girdle set upon a dark elephant.
'24': >-
  Janaka’s daughter—lotus-yellow, resplendent like gold, her ornaments as though
  heated and glowing—shone, having entered upon Rāvaṇa, like lightning upon a
  cloud.
'25': >-
  By the sound of Vaidehī’s ornaments, the rākṣasa-lord appeared like a spotless
  dark rain-cloud rumbling with thunder.
'26': >-
  Then from Sītā’s head, flowers fell in a shower on every side, as she was
  being carried away, and dropped upon the surface of the earth.
'27': >-
  But that flower-shower, driven back on all sides by the speed of Rāvaṇa, was
  whirled about and returned again upon Daśagrīva.
'28': >-
  A pure stream of flowers turned back upon the younger brother of Vaiśravaṇa,
  like a stainless garland of stars returning around lofty Meru, king of
  mountains.
'29': >-
  From Vaidehī’s foot a jewelled anklet slipped off; resembling a circle of
  lightning, it fell upon the earth.
'30': >-
  Vaidehī—ruddy like the shoots of trees—made that dark-bodied lord of rākṣasas
  more splendid, as a golden girth adorns an elephant’s flank.
'31': >-
  Entering the sky, the younger brother of Vaiśravaṇa bore away Sītā, blazing
  there like a great meteor, radiant with her own splendour.
'32': >-
  Her ornaments, of fire-like colour, fell upon the earth with clattering
  sounds, as stars fall from the firmament when their light is spent.
'33': >-
  From between Vaidehī’s breasts her necklace, bright as the Moon, slipped and
  fell; and falling, it shone like the Gaṅgā descending from the heavens.
'34': >-
  Delighting in ominous winds, attended by hosts of various birds, the
  trees—whose tops were shaken—seemed as though to say, “Fear not!”
'35': >-
  The lotus-pools, their lotuses shattered and their fish and water-creatures
  terrified, seemed to grieve for Maithilī as for a companion whose courage had
  departed.
'36': >-
  Then, from all sides, lions, tigers, deer, and birds rushed together, and in
  wrath ran after her—following the shadow of Sītā.
'37': >-
  With waterfalls for tears, and with their horns uplifted like upraised arms,
  the mountains seemed to cry out as Sītā was being carried away.
'38': >-
  Seeing Vaidehī being borne away, the Sun, sorrowful, became of shattered
  radiance; the glorious orb grew pale.
'39': >-
  Where Rāvaṇa carries off Sītā, Vaidehī of Rāma—there is no dharma; whence then
  truth? neither uprightness nor compassion can remain.
'40': >-
  Thus all beings, group after group, wailed aloud; fawns, frightened and with
  downcast faces, wept.
'41': >-
  Looking again and again with eyes as though distorted by fear, and with their
  bodies trembling greatly, the deities of the forest stood aghast.
'42': >-
  Seeing Sītā crying out loudly and thus fallen into misery—crying in a sweet
  voice, “Lakṣmaṇa! Rāma!”
'43': >-
  While she looked again and again toward the ground, Vaidehī—her hair
  dishevelled, her special ornaments smeared and disordered—was carried away by
  Daśagrīva, that high-minded lady, unto his own destruction.
'44': >-
  Then Maithilī, weeping piteously, her pure smile gone, separated from her
  kinsfolk, and not beholding both Rāghava and Lakṣmaṇa, became pale of face,
  oppressed by the heavy burden of fear.
'45': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-second canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the sacred epic composed by the Ṛṣi.
