  Now begins the eighty-third canto, named “The Desire to perform the Rājasūya
  Sacrifice,” in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Hearing those words spoken by Rāma of untiring deeds, the doorkeeper,
  summoning the two princes who were standing at the door, reported their
  arrival to Rāghava.
'2': >-
  Seeing that his beloved brothers Bharata and Lakṣmaṇa had arrived, Rāghava
  embraced them; and then Rāma spoke these words.
'3': >-
  “I have accomplished, in due and proper manner, that unsurpassed rite enjoined
  for the twice-born. And now again, O Rāghavas, I desire to establish a bridge
  of dharma.”
'4': >-
  “This bridge of dharma, as I deem it, is imperishable and inexhaustible. For
  it promotes righteousness and destroys all sins.”
'5': >-
  “Together with you two—who are as my very selves—I wish to perform the
  unsurpassed Rājasūya sacrifice; for therein dharma is eternal.”
'6': >-
  “Indeed, Mitra, the subduer of enemies, having performed the
  Rājasūya—well-offered, a noble sacrifice with proper oblations—attained the
  station of Varuṇa.”
'7': >-
  “And Soma too, the knower of dharma, having duly performed the Rājasūya
  according to righteousness, obtained in all worlds a permanent abode of fame.”
'8': >-
  “Therefore, on this very day, consider with me what course is most beneficial.
  Striving together, you ought to accomplish what is wholesome and rightly
  ordered for the future as well.”
'9': >-
  Hearing these words of Rāghava, Bharata—skilled in speech—stood with joined
  palms and spoke as follows.
'10': >-
  “In you, O virtuous one, dharma is supreme; in you, O mighty-armed one, the
  entire earth is established; and in you, O man of immeasurable prowess, abides
  renown.”
'11': >-
  “All the rulers of the earth, like the gods looking upon Prajāpati, gaze upon
  you—the great-souled Lord of the worlds—even as we do.”
'12': >-
  “O king, sons look upon you as upon a father, O greatly powerful one. O
  Rāghava, you have become the very course and refuge of the earth, and of
  living beings as well.”
'13': >-
  “How then, O sovereign, would you undertake such a sacrifice, wherein is seen
  the destruction of royal lineages upon the earth?”
'14': >-
  “And those men upon the earth, O king, who have attained prowess—of all of
  them there will be, in that rite, a great wasting away arising from universal
  wrath.”
'15': >-
  “Therefore you, O tiger among men, whose valor is incomparable through your
  virtues, ought not to slay the earth, for it remains under your sway.”
'16': >-
  Hearing Bharata’s words—nectar-like—Rāma, whose prowess was true, then
  attained an unsurpassed delight.
'17': >-
  And pleased, he spoke auspicious words that gladdened the joy of the
  Kaikeyī-born (Bharata): “Today I am gratified; today I am fully content with
  your speech, O blameless one.”
'18': >-
  “This statement of yours is not mean-spirited; it is grounded in dharma. O
  tiger among men, you have spoken for the protection of the earth.”
'19': >-
  “In accordance with our intention to undertake the Rājasūya, the best of
  sacrifices, I now desist, O knower of dharma—because of your well-spoken
  counsel.”
'20': >-
  “The wise should not perform an act that causes suffering to the world. Yet
  the wholesome word of the young should indeed be accepted, O elder brother of
  Lakṣmaṇa. Therefore I heed your words—good and well-reasoned, O great-minded
  one.”
'21': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-third canto, named “The Desire to perform the Rājasūya
  Sacrifice,” in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval
  epic.
