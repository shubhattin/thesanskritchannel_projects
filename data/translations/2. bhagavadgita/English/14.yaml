'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (Paramātman).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': >-
  Now, the Fourteenth Chapter: The Yoga of the Division (Analysis) of the Three
  Guṇas.
'3': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'4': >-
  Once again I shall declare to thee the supreme knowledge—the highest among all
  knowledges—knowing which all the sages have attained the supreme perfection,
  having gone hence (from this world).
'5': >-
  Taking refuge in this knowledge, they attain My very likeness (identity of
  nature with Me); they are not born even at the time of creation, nor are they
  distressed at the time of dissolution.
'6': >-
  My womb is the great Brahman; in that I place the germ. From that arises the
  origin of all beings, O Bhārata.
'7': >-
  In all wombs, O son of Kuntī, whatever forms are born—of them the great
  Brahman is the womb, and I am the seed-giving Father.
'8': >-
  Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas—these guṇas, born of Prakṛti—bind, O mighty-armed
  one, the imperishable embodied Self within the body.
'9': >-
  Of these, Sattva, by reason of its stainlessness, is luminous and free from
  affliction; it binds, O sinless one, by attachment to happiness and by
  attachment to knowledge.
'10': >-
  Know Rajas to be of the nature of passion, born of craving and attachment; it
  binds the embodied one, O son of Kuntī, by attachment to action.
'11': >-
  But know Tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all embodied beings; it
  binds, O Bhārata, by negligence, indolence, and sleep.
'12': >-
  Sattva attaches one to happiness, O Bhārata; Rajas to action; but Tamas,
  veiling knowledge, attaches one indeed to negligence and heedlessness.
'13': >-
  Overpowering Rajas and Tamas, Sattva prevails, O Bhārata; overpowering Sattva
  and Tamas, Rajas prevails; and overpowering Sattva and Rajas, Tamas prevails
  likewise.
'14': >-
  When, in this body, illumination arises through all the gates (of the senses),
  then one should know that Sattva has increased and grown predominant.
'15': >-
  Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, restlessness, and longing—these
  arise when Rajas is predominant, O best of the Bhāratas.
'16': >-
  Non-illumination, inactivity, negligence, and delusion—these arise when Tamas
  is predominant, O joy of the Kurus.
'17': >-
  When the embodied one meets death while Sattva is predominant, then he attains
  the pure worlds of those who know the Highest (the knowers of the supreme
  Truth).
'18': >-
  Meeting death when Rajas predominates, he is born among those attached to
  action; and likewise, dying when Tamas predominates, he is born in the wombs
  of the deluded.
'19': >-
  They say that the fruit of good action is sāttvic—pure and stainless; but the
  fruit of Rajas is sorrow; and the fruit of Tamas is ignorance.
'20': >-
  From Sattva arises knowledge; from Rajas, greed; from Tamas arise negligence
  and delusion, and also ignorance indeed.
'21': >-
  Those established in Sattva go upward; the rajasic dwell in the middle; those
  abiding in the function of the lowest guṇa—tamasic—go downward.
'22': >-
  When the seer perceives no agent other than the guṇas, and knows That which is
  higher than the guṇas, he attains My Being.
'23': >-
  The embodied one, having transcended these three guṇas from which the body is
  born, is freed from birth, death, old age, and sorrow, and attains
  immortality.
'24': 'Arjuna said:'
'25': >-
  By what marks, O Lord, is one known who has transcended these three guṇas?
  What is his conduct, and how does he pass beyond these three guṇas?
'26': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'27': >-
  Light (illumination), activity, and delusion, O Pāṇḍava—he neither hates them
  when they arise, nor longs for them when they cease.
'28': >-
  Seated as one indifferent, he is not shaken by the guṇas; abiding thus,
  thinking ‘the guṇas alone act,’ he stands firm and does not waver.
'29': >-
  He who is the same in sorrow and in happiness, who is self-abiding (steadfast
  in the Self), to whom a clod of earth, a stone, and gold are alike; to whom
  the agreeable and the disagreeable are equal; who is wise and steady; to whom
  blame and praise are the same—
'30': >-
  He who is equal in honor and dishonor; equal toward friend and foe; who has
  abandoned all undertakings—he is called one who has transcended the guṇas.
'31': >-
  And he who serves Me with unwavering devotion through the yoga of bhakti—he,
  having gone beyond these guṇas, becomes fit for becoming Brahman (attains
  Brahman-state).
'32': >-
  For I am indeed the foundation (abode) of Brahman, of the immortal and the
  imperishable, and of the eternal dharma, and of absolute (unending) bliss.
'33': >-
  ‘Om Tat Sat’—thus in the Upaniṣads of the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, in the
  knowledge of Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue between Śrī
  Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, ends the Fourteenth Chapter entitled ‘The Yoga of the
  Division of the Three Guṇas.’
