  Now begins the sixty-ninth sarga in the Bāla-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Meeting of Daśaratha and Janaka.”
'1': >-
  Then, when the night had passed, King Daśaratha—gladdened at heart—together
  with his preceptor and his kinsmen, spoke these words to Sumantra:
'2': >-
  “Let all the superintendents of wealth take abundant treasure and, duly
  instructed, proceed in front, furnished with many kinds of jewels.
'3': >-
  Let the fourfold army also set out at once on every side; and let my most
  excellent, well-yoked conveyance be made ready at the same time, in accordance
  with my command.
'4': >-
  “Let Vasiṣṭha and Vāmadeva, and Jābāli, and then Kaśyapa; and long-lived
  Mārkaṇḍeya the ṛṣi, and likewise Kātyāyana—
'5': >-
  these twice-born proceed in front. Yoke my chariot; let there be no delay of
  time, for the messengers are urging me to haste.”
'6': >-
  At the word of the lord of men, the fourfold army followed behind the king as
  he set out together with the ṛṣis.
'7': >-
  Having travelled for four days upon the road, he drew near to the Videhas; and
  the illustrious King Janaka, hearing of his arrival, made arrangements for due
  honour and reception.
'8': >-
  Then, on reaching the aged king Daśaratha, King Janaka, filled with joy,
  attained supreme delight.
'9': >-
  That best of kings spoke, with gladness, to that best of men: “Welcome to you,
  O best of men. By good fortune you have arrived, O Rāghava!
'10': >-
  You shall obtain the affection of both your sons, won by their valour. By good
  fortune the blessed ṛṣi Vasiṣṭha, of great splendour, has arrived,
'11': >-
  together with all the foremost of twice-born, like Indra, the performer of a
  hundred sacrifices, accompanied by the gods. By good fortune my obstacles have
  been overcome; by good fortune my lineage has been honoured,
'12': >-
  through alliance with the Rāghavas—supreme in prowess and of great might.
  Tomorrow at dawn, O lord of men, you should bring to completion,
'13': >-
  at the end of the sacrifice, the marriage, together with the most excellent of
  ṛṣis.” Hearing those words of his, the king, in the midst of the ṛṣis,
'14': >-
  the best of those skilled in speech, replied to the lord of the earth:
  “Acceptance depends upon the giver—this have I heard of old.
'15': >-
  As you shall say, O knower of dharma, so shall we do. Those words of the
  truth-speaking one are most righteous and full of renown.”
'16': >-
  Hearing this, the lord of Videha came to the highest wonder. Then all the
  assemblages of sages, in their mutual meeting,
'17': >-
  endowed with great joy, passed that night in comfort. Then Rāma of great
  splendour went together with Lakṣmaṇa,
'18': >-
  placing Viśvāmitra in the forefront, and touched his father’s feet. And King
  Daśaratha, seeing his two sons, the Rāghavas, rejoiced exceedingly;
'19': >-
  supremely pleased, and honoured by Janaka, he stayed there. Janaka too, of
  great splendour—knower of the true principles, performing the rites according
  to dharma—having carried out what was to be done regarding the sacrifice and
  regarding his daughters, likewise passed the night there.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-ninth sarga in the Bāla-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Meeting of Daśaratha and Janaka.”
