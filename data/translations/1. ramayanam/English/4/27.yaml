  Now begins the twenty-seventh canto, named “The Dwelling on Mālyavat,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  When Sugrīva had been consecrated and had entered the cave with the monkeys,
  Rāma, together with his brother, came to Mount Prasravaṇa.
'2': >-
  It resounded with the cries of tigers and deer, and was encircled by lions of
  dreadful roar; it was hidden by many kinds of thickets and creepers and was
  crowded with many-footed creatures.
'3': >-
  It was frequented by bears and monkeys and by wildcats; the mountain,
  resembling a mass of clouds, was ever purifying and auspicious.
'4': >-
  On the summit of that mountain, Rāma, along with Saumitrī (Lakṣmaṇa), chose
  for their dwelling a spacious cave of great depth.
'5': >-
  And Rāma, the sinless descendant of Raghu, having made an agreement with
  Sugrīva, spoke weighty words suited to the time.
'6': >-
  “Lakṣmaṇa, dear brother—obedient and a nourisher of fortune—this mountain-cave
  is delightful, wide, and supplied with fitting breezes.
'7': >-
  Here, O Saumitrī, shall I dwell through the nights of the rainy season, O
  subduer of foes, O prince.
'8': >-
  This charming mountain-peak is adorned with stones white, black, and
  copper-hued; it is strewn with diverse minerals, and joined with rivers and
  cascades.
'9': >-
  It is furnished with various groves of trees and with fair, variegated
  creepers; it resounds with flocks of many kinds of birds and is echoed by the
  noble cries of peacocks.
'10': >-
  It is beautified by blossoming thickets of mālatī and kunda, by sinduvāra and
  śirīṣa, and by flowering kadamba, arjuna, and sarja trees.
'11': >-
  And this lovely lotus-pond, adorned with fully bloomed lotuses, will be not
  far from our cave, O prince.
'12': >-
  In a place sloping to the east and north, this cave will be well-situated; and
  behind it, O gentle one, it will be elevated and sheltered from the wind.
'13': >-
  And at the cave’s entrance, O Saumitrī, there is a smooth, auspicious slab of
  rock—black and long, like a heap of split collyrium (añjana).
'14': >-
  Behold, dear one, this mountain-peak here, and see also, to the north, that
  auspicious mass—rising like a cloud, shaped like a heap of broken collyrium.
'15': >-
  And in the southern quarter also stands another, as though white as the
  sky—like the summit of Kailāsa, shining with various minerals.
'16': >-
  Look further beyond the cave at that ancient-flowing river, exceedingly free
  of mud—like Jāhnavī (the Gaṅgā) at Trikūṭa.
'17': >-
  It is adorned with sandalwood and tilaka trees, sāla and tamāla, atimukta
  creepers, padmaka, śarala pines, and aśoka trees.
'18': >-
  With vāṇīra and timida, with bakula and ketaka also; with hintāla palms,
  tiniśa, nīpa, and vetasa, and with kṛtamālaka—(the banks are covered) with
  these.
'19': >-
  Adorned with bank-born trees of many forms here and there, it shines like a
  lovely woman decorated with garments and ornaments.
'20': >-
  It is filled with hundreds of flocks of birds, sounding forth with diverse
  calls; and it is adorned with pairs of devoted cakravāka birds, each attached
  to its mate.
'21': >-
  With exceedingly lovely sandbanks, frequented by swans and sārasas, this river
  seems to laugh as it were, being endowed with many kinds of gems.
'22': >-
  In some places it is covered with blue lotuses; in some places it shines with
  red lotuses; and in some places it gleams with divine white buds of
  kumuda-lilies.
'23': >-
  Resorted to by hundreds of waterfowl and sounded by the cries of peacocks and
  krauñcas, this lovely river, O gentle one, is frequented by throngs of sages.
'24': >-
  See the row of sandalwood trees, as though exceedingly beautiful; and the
  kaku-bha trees are seen—appearing, as it were, in harmony with one’s very
  imagination.
'25': >-
  Ah, how exceedingly delightful is this region, O slayer of foes! Surely we
  shall take our pleasure, O Saumitrī; well indeed is it that we dwell here.
'26': >-
  And not far from here is that Kiṣkindhā, with its wondrous forests—the lovely
  city of Sugrīva, O prince.
'27': >-
  The sound of songs and instruments is heard, O best of victors, along with the
  booming of kettledrums and the cries of the roaring monkeys.
'28': >-
  Having obtained a wife, the foremost of monkeys, having gained the kingdom,
  and being surrounded by friends, Sugrīva surely rejoices, having attained
  great prosperity.
'29': >-
  Having thus spoken, Rāghava, together with Lakṣmaṇa, dwelt there on that
  Prasravaṇa mountain, in a glen of caves and bowers rich in many a pleasing
  sight.
'30': >-
  Yet, though dwelling on that mountain—most comfortable and abounding in many
  resources—Rāma found not even a little delight.
'31': >-
  For, remembering his wife who had been carried off—dearer to him than
  life-breath—and especially on seeing the moon risen with the night’s ascent,
'32': >-
  sleep did not enter him, even when he had gone to his couch at nights, his
  awareness being overwhelmed by the grief that arose therefrom and by tears.
'33': >-
  Seeing the son of Kakutstha ever grieving, ever devoted to sorrow,
  Lakṣmaṇa—sharing the same pain—spoke words of gentle persuasion.
'34': >-
  “Enough, O hero, of giving way to anguish; you ought not to grieve. For when
  one grieves, all purposes sink down—this is known to you.
'35': >-
  You are, in the world, one devoted to action; you are devoted to the gods; you
  are a believer, righteous in conduct, and resolute in undertaking, O Rāghava.
'36': >-
  Indeed, being resolute, you are able in battle to slay that foe—the rākṣasa,
  especially that crooked-doer—by your valour.
'37': >-
  Uproot your sorrow; make your resolve firm. Then you are fit to slay that
  rākṣasa together with his followers and kinsmen.
'38': >-
  O Kakutstha, you are able even to overturn the earth with its oceans, forests,
  and mountains—how much more then that Rāvaṇa!
'39': >-
  Await the autumn season; this time is the rains. Then you shall slay that
  Rāvaṇa together with his realm and his hosts.
'40': >-
  As for me, I shall indeed awaken your valour that lies as though asleep—like
  fire at the proper time, covered with ashes, (roused) by blazing oblations.
'41': >-
  Honouring Lakṣmaṇa’s words—beneficial and auspicious—Rāghava spoke this
  affectionate reply to his dear friend.
'42': >-
  “That which should be spoken by one who is devoted, affectionate, and
  well-wishing—and endowed with true prowess—that indeed has been spoken by you,
  O Lakṣmaṇa.
'43': >-
  This grief, which brings all enterprises to ruin, is cast aside. I shall rouse
  my unconquered energy for acts of valour.
'44': >-
  I shall await the autumn season, standing by your word, and observing with due
  regard the favour of Sugrīva and of the rivers (i.e., the seasons and their
  conditions).”
'45': >-
  A hero should be bound by gratitude through return for a kindness. The
  ungrateful man, who does not repay, smites the hearts of the noble.
'46': >-
  Therefore Lakṣmaṇa—having reflected that this was fitting—joining his palms
  and duly honouring that utterance, spoke to Rāma of pleasing appearance,
  showing his own auspicious countenance.
'47': >-
  “All this that you desire shall be done, O lord of men, by the monkey before
  long. May you, awaiting autumn, be patient—restraining this flood (of wrath)
  while intent upon the subjugation of the foe.
'48': >-
  Restrain your anger; let autumn be awaited. Forgive these four months together
  with me. Dwelling on this mountain frequented by the king of beasts (lions),
  you will be fully capable of bringing about the slaying of the foe.”
'49': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-seventh canto, named “The Dwelling on Mālyavat,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
