  Now begins the fourteenth canto in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Meeting with Jaṭāyu.”
'1': >-
  Then, as the delight of the Raghu-line was proceeding toward Pañcavaṭī, on the
  way he encountered a mighty-bodied vulture, of dreadful prowess.
'2': >-
  Seeing him—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, both highly fortunate, dwelling in the
  forest—took that winged one to be a rākṣasa, and addressed him, “Who are you?”
'3': >-
  He, as though wishing to gladden them, spoke to them in sweet and gentle
  words: “Dear sons, know me to be a friend of your father, of the same age as
  he.”
'4': >-
  Taking him to be his father’s friend, Rāghava honored him; and then, with an
  untroubled mind, he asked him about his lineage and also his name.
'5': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words—about lineage and about himself—the twice-born one
  declared everything to him: the origin of all beings.
'6': >-
  “In former times, O mighty-armed one, there were the Prajāpatis. Hear from me,
  as I recount them all from the beginning, O Rāghava.
'7': >-
  Kardama was the first of them; Vikṛta was next; and then Śeṣa, and Saṃśraya,
  and the valiant Bahuputra as well.
'8': >-
  Sthāṇu, Marīci, Atri, and Kratu of great might; Pulastya and Aṅgirā; Pracetā,
  and Pulaha likewise.
'9': >-
  Dakṣa; and another was Vivasvān; and Ariṣṭanemi too, O Rāghava; and Kāśyapa of
  great splendor—he was the last among them.
'10': >-
  Of the Prajāpati Dakṣa, it is famed, O Rāma, O greatly renowned one, that
  there were sixty daughters, illustrious in name and glory.
'11': >-
  Kāśyapa accepted eight of them, slender-waisted: Aditi, Diti, Danu, and
  Kālakā,
'12': >-
  Tāmra, Krodhavaśā, Manu, and Anālā as well. Then Kāśyapa, pleased with those
  maidens, spoke again:
'13': >-
  “You shall bear sons who will be lords of the three worlds, equal to me.”
  Aditi, O Rāma, consented to that in her heart, as did Diti and Danu.
'14': >-
  Kālakā too, O mighty-armed one, agreed; but the others were not of that same
  intent. From Aditi were born the gods—thirty-three, O subduer of foes.
'15': >-
  The Ādityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, and the two Aśvins, O scorcher of enemies.
  But Diti bore sons—the Daityas, illustrious one.
'16': >-
  Of those, this earth in ancient times became full of forests and oceans. And
  Danu bore a son, Aśvagrīva, O subduer of foes.
'17': >-
  Kālakā gave birth to Naraka and Kālakā as well; and also to Krauñcī, Bhāsī,
  Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī, and Śukī.
'18': >-
  Tāmra bore five daughters—these renowned in the worlds. Krauñcī gave birth to
  owls; Bhāsī gave birth to hawks.
'19': >-
  Śyenī bore hawks and vultures of great brilliance. Dhṛtarāṣṭrī, for her part,
  bore swans and likewise all kinds of ruddy geese.
'20': >-
  That fair one also bore cakravāka birds and other auspicious birds. Śukī bore
  Natā; and from Natā was born her daughter Vinatā.
'21': >-
  Krodhavaśā, O Rāma, gave birth to ten daughters sprung from her own being:
  Mṛgī, Mṛgamandā, Harī, and Bhadrāmadā as well;
'22': >-
  Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī, Śvetā, and Surabhī likewise—endowed with all auspicious
  marks—and also Surasā and Kadrukā.
'23': >-
  From Mṛgī were born all the deer, O best of men. From Mṛgamandā were born
  bears; also sṛmaras and camaras.
'24': >-
  Then Bhadrāmadā bore a daughter named Irāvatī. From her was born Airāvata—the
  world-lord, that great elephant.
'25': >-
  From Harī were born the haris, and the vānaras too, austere by nature. Śārdūlī
  bore sons—the gopucchas (long-tailed beasts) and tigers.
'26': >-
  From Mātaṅgī, O bull among men, came the offspring called elephants. Śvetā, O
  Kakutstha, bore the directional elephants.
'27': >-
  Then Surabhī, O Rāma, bore two daughters. One was named Rohiṇī, auspicious to
  you; the other was the illustrious Gandharvī.
'28': >-
  Rohiṇī gave birth to cows; Gandharvī bore offspring in the form of horses.
  Surasā bore nāgas, O Rāma, and Kadrū bore pannagas (serpents).
'29': >-
  Manu, of great soul and son of Kāśyapa, begot mankind—brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas,
  vaiśyas, and śūdras, O best of men.
'30': >-
  From the mouth were born the brāhmaṇas; from the chest the kṣatriyas likewise;
  from the thighs were born the vaiśyas; and from the feet the śūdras—thus is it
  heard.
'31': >-
  Anālā too brought forth all trees that yield holy fruit. And
  Vinatā—granddaughter of Śukī—while Kadrū and Surasā were her sisters.
'32': >-
  Kadrū bore a thousand nāgas, O upholder of the earth. But Vinatā had two
  sons—Garuḍa and Aruṇa.
'33': >-
  From Aruṇa was I born, and my elder brother is Sampāti. Know me as Jaṭāyu—the
  son of Śyenī, O subduer of foes.
'34': >-
  “I shall indeed be your companion and helper, if you so desire. For this
  wilderness is hard to traverse, frequented by deer and rākṣasas. And, dear
  prince, I shall protect Sītā while you go forth with Lakṣmaṇa.”
'35': >-
  Rāghava, having duly honored Jaṭāyu, embraced him joyfully and bowed in
  reverence. For that self-possessed hero had heard repeatedly of Jaṭāyu’s
  friendship with his father, as Jaṭāyu related it again and again.
'36': >-
  Thereupon, entrusting Maithilī Sītā to that exceedingly powerful bird, he set
  out with Lakṣmaṇa for Pañcavaṭī—intent on consuming his foes like fire
  devouring moths.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the fourteenth canto in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the venerable, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the primeval epic, named “The Meeting with
  Jaṭāyu.”
