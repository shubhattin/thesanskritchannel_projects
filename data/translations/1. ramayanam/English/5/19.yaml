  Now begins the nineteenth canto (sarga) of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the holy
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Similes of Sītā in Distress (Kṛcchra-gatā
  Sītā-upamāḥ).”
'1': >-
  Then, at that very time, the princess—blameless—endowed with beauty and youth,
  adorned with the choicest ornaments, sat there.
'2': >-
  Thereupon, seeing Rāvaṇa, the lord of the rākṣasas, Vaidehī, that high-born
  lady, trembled—like a plantain tree shaken by the wind.
'3': >-
  Covering her belly with her thighs, and her bosom with her arms, that
  large-eyed, fair-complexioned lady sat down weeping.
'4': >-
  Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa) then beheld Vaidehī, guarded by hosts of rākṣasī
  women—wretched, tormented by sorrow—like a boat sinking in the ocean.
'5': >-
  He saw her seated on the bare earth, steadfast in her vowed resolve—like a
  severed branch of a tree fallen upon the ground.
'6': >-
  Her body smeared with grime in place of adornment—though worthy of ornaments,
  now unadorned—she both shone and did not shine, like a lotus-stalk smeared
  with mud.
'7': >-
  She appeared as though she were going near Rāma, the lion among kings, the
  self-knowing one—borne, as it were, by chariot-horses that were her firm
  resolves, and yoked to the steeds of her imaginings.
'8': >-
  Wasting away, weeping alone, wholly absorbed in meditation and grief—seeing no
  end to her sorrow—devoted to Rāma, following Rāma as her vow, she remained.
'9': >-
  She was seen moving restlessly and overwhelmed, like the bride of the lord of
  serpents (Nāga-king); and like Rohiṇī being afflicted by the ‘seizer’
  (eclipse) through a comet, she seemed as though she were being consumed.
'10': >-
  Born in a noble family of impeccable conduct—righteous and guided by proper
  custom—she appeared again as though she had fallen into an evil household, as
  if her refining rites had been undone.
'11': >-
  She looked like great fame brought low; like faith dishonoured; like wisdom
  diminished; like hope thwarted.
'12': >-
  Like a command overthrown; like authority obstructed; like a brilliant quarter
  of the sky dimmed at the wrong time; like worship that has been violated.
'13': >-
  Like the night of the full moon with the disk of the moon swallowed by
  darkness; like a lotus-pond laid waste; like an army whose heroes have been
  slain.
'14': >-
  Like radiance struck down by darkness; like a river that has run low; like a
  sacrificial altar defiled by touch; like a flame that has been quenched.
'15': >-
  Like a lotus-pond with its excellent leaves and lotuses, its birds terrified
  and fled—disturbed as though it had been raked by an elephant’s trunk.
'16': >-
  Like a river dried up, drained away, afflicted by the grief of separation from
  its lord; like a night in the dark fortnight, bereft of its supreme light.
'17': >-
  Tender, with well-formed limbs, fit to dwell in a mansion filled with
  jewels—she seemed like a lotus-stalk newly drawn forth, being scorched by
  heat.
'18': >-
  Like the wife of a lordly elephant, seized and bound to a post, separated from
  her herd-leader—she sighed again and again, grievously distressed by sorrow.
'19': >-
  With a single long braid, she shone without effort—like the earth’s woodland
  realm when the dark clouds have dispersed, appearing deep blue-green.
'20': >-
  Wasted by fasting, by grief, by constant brooding, and by fear—emaciated,
  thin, wretched, of scant food, rich in austerity—she sat there.
'21': >-
  Sorrow-stricken, she seemed to beg with folded hands like a goddess—by the
  force of her feeling imploring the overthrow of Daśagrīva by the foremost of
  the Raghu line.
'22': >-
  As she looked on and wept—blameless, with lovely lashes, with eyes reddish at
  the corners, long and white—ever devoted to Rāma, even that Maithilī, Rāvaṇa
  sought to entice, intending her destruction.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the nineteenth canto of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Similes of Sītā in Distress
  (Kṛcchra-gatā Sītā-upamāḥ).”
