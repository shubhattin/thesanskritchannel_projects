  Now begins the eightieth chapter of the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Union with Arajā.”
'1': >-
  Having related this to Rāma, the great sage, the son of Kumbha (Agastya), in
  this very narrative began again with another statement.
'2': >-
  Then that Danda, O scion of Kakutstha, for many tens of thousands of years
  ruled there—self-controlled—having made the kingdom free of thorns (i.e., rid
  of all sources of oppression and trouble).
'3': >-
  Now, at a certain time, the king went forth toward the charming hermitage of
  the Bhārgava, in the delightful month of Caitra, in a most pleasing season.
'4': >-
  There Danda beheld, moving about in a tract of forest, the Bhārgava
  maiden—unsurpassed, and in beauty without equal upon the earth.
'5': >-
  Seeing her, that ill-witted man, tormented by the shafts of the bodiless one
  (Kāma), approached the greatly agitated maiden and spoke these words.
'6': >-
  “From where are you, O fair-hipped one? Or whose daughter are you, O
  auspicious lady? I am afflicted by Kāma; I desire you, O fair-faced one.”
'7': >-
  When the deluded, love-maddened man spoke thus, the Bhārgavī addressed the
  king with these words, gently and with entreaty.
'8': >-
  “Know me, O lord of kings, to be the daughter of the divine Bhārgava, of
  unwearied deeds—named Arajā, the eldest one, dwelling in the hermitage.
'9': >-
  “Do not touch me by force, O king; for I am a maiden under my father’s
  authority. My father is my guru, O lord of kings, and you are the disciple of
  that great-souled one. If angered, that great ascetic would inflict upon you a
  very great calamity.”
'10': >-
  “If there is anything else you desire from me, in the righteous way, upon the
  good path of dharma—choose my father, the mighty and splendid one, O best of
  men.”
'11': >-
  “Otherwise, a dreadful consequence, truly terrible in its outcome, would
  befall you; for my father, by wrath, could burn even the three worlds.”
'12': >-
  “And, O faultless-limbed one, my father will give me to you—only if he is
  asked.”
'13': >-
  Though Arajā spoke thus, Danda, having come under the power of desire,
  replied—intoxicated with arrogance—and, placing his joined palms upon his head
  in supplication, spoke.
'14': >-
  “Show me favor, O fair-hipped one; you ought not to waste time. For your sake,
  O lovely-faced one, my very life-breaths are being torn apart.”
'15': >-
  “Having obtained you, there may be death for me, or a terrible curse; yet, O
  timid one, accept me—me who am devoted, who seek you, and who am utterly
  shaken.”
'16': >-
  Having spoken thus to that maiden, the powerful man seized her with both arms
  by force; and though she struggled and trembled, he proceeded, as he wished,
  toward sexual union.
'17': >-
  Having committed this most dreadful and exceedingly cruel deed, Danda quickly
  went to his excellent city, Madhumanta.
'18': >-
  And Arajā too—she weeping—stayed not far from the hermitage, waiting in great
  terror for her father, who was like a god.
'19': >-
  Thus ends the eightieth chapter in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Union with Arajā.”
