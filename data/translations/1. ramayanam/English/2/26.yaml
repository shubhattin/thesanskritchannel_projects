  Now begins the twenty‑sixth canto of the Ayodhyā‑kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki‑Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Restraining (or Dissuasion) of Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Having duly bowed to Kausalyā, Rāma set forth for the forest; and having
  received from his mother the auspicious rites and blessings for well‑being, he
  stood firm upon the path of righteousness.
'2': >-
  The prince, shining in splendour, proceeded along the royal highway thronged
  with people; and by the excellence of his virtues he as though churned and
  stirred the hearts of the populace.
'3': >-
  But Vaidehī, the ascetic‑minded lady, heard nothing of all that; for in her
  heart there was only that very thought—the consecration for the office of
  heir‑apparent.
'4': >-
  Having performed the rites due to the gods, grateful and with a gladdened
  mind, the princess—well acquainted with the duties of kings—awaited the coming
  of the prince.
'5': >-
  Then Rāma entered his own well‑adorned residence, which was filled with
  rejoicing people; yet, out of modesty and shame, he kept his face somewhat
  downcast.
'6': >-
  Thereupon Sītā sprang up, and, trembling, beheld her husband—consumed by
  sorrow, his senses distressed and agitated with anxious thought.
'7': >-
  Seeing her, that righteous‑souled one could not restrain what was in his mind;
  and thus Rāghava, unable to bear that grief, became as though laid open and
  revealed.
'8': >-
  Beholding his pallid countenance, him sweating and impatient (with inner
  turmoil), she, tormented by grief, said: “Lord, what is this now?”
'9': >-
  “Today, O Rāghava, this auspicious day is joined with Puṣya under Bṛhaspati’s
  influence, as the wise brāhmaṇas declare; why then are you dejected?”
'10': >-
  “Your lovely face is not covered over and made resplendent by the white
  parasol with its hundred spokes, like foam upon water.”
'11': >-
  “Nor is your lotus‑petal‑like eye‑radiant face being fanned by the two chief
  yak‑tail fans, bright as the moon and the swan.”
'12': >-
  “The eloquent panegyrists, the bards—those sūtas and māgadhas—delighting in
  auspicious songs, are not seen today praising you, O bull among men.”
'13': >-
  “Nor do the brāhmaṇas, learned in the Vedas, according to ordinance, place
  upon the head of you who are to be consecrated, honey and curds.”
'14': >-
  “All the citizens and folk of the countryside—together with the adornèd
  guild‑leaders and foremost among the people—do not seek to follow you in
  procession.”
'15': >-
  “Why does not that foremost flower‑decked chariot, yoked with four swift
  steeds adorned with golden ornaments, go before you?”
'16': >-
  “Nor in your departure is that splendid elephant seen in front—honoured for
  all auspicious marks—whose lustre is like a dark rain‑cloud or a mountain.”
'17': >-
  “Nor, O hero of pleasing aspect, do I see your gold‑wrought and variegated
  auspicious seat being borne at the front as you proceed.”
'18': >-
  “When the consecration is ready, what is this now that has come upon you? An
  unwonted hue is on your face, and no joy is to be perceived.”
'19': >-
  Thus lamenting, she was addressed by the delight of the Raghu‑line: “Sītā, the
  venerable father there—my father—banishes me to the forest.”
'20': >-
  “O Jānakī, born in a great lineage, knowing dharma and practising dharma, hear
  from me how, step by step, this has come to me today.”
'21': >-
  “Formerly, my father, King Daśaratha—true to his promise—granted to Kaikeyī,
  my mother, two mighty boons.”
'22': >-
  “By her, today, when my consecration has been made ready, the king is
  constrained; thus that agreed time, by dharma’s power, has prevailed and
  overcome him.”
'23': >-
  “For fourteen years must I dwell in Daṇḍaka; and by my father Bharata too has
  been appointed to the yūvarājya (the office of heir‑apparent).”
'24': >-
  “Therefore I have come to see you and am setting out for the lonely forest.
  And you must never speak of me in Bharata’s presence.”
'25': >-
  “For men endowed with prosperity do not endure another’s praise; therefore my
  virtues must not be spoken of by you before Bharata.”
'26': >-
  “And you must not speak on my behalf at all—especially at any time; only by
  being agreeable can one live near him.”
'27': >-
  “To him the king has given the ancient right of the yūvarājya. He must be
  conciliated by you, O Sītā—and especially the king himself.”
'28': >-
  “And I, maintaining that pledge of my revered father, shall go to the forest
  this very day. Be steadfast, O woman of resolute mind.”
'29': >-
  “When I have gone, O auspicious lady, to the forest frequented by sages, you,
  O blameless one, should live devoted to vows and fasts.”
'30': >-
  “Rising early, having worshipped the gods according to rule, you should bow to
  Daśaratha—my father, the lord of men.”
'31': >-
  “And my mother Kausalyā, aged and worn by sorrow, keeping dharma foremost,
  deserves honour from you.”
'32': >-
  “And you should ever bow daily to my other mothers who remain; for in
  affection, love, and intimate goodwill, they are as my mothers indeed.”
'33': >-
  “And especially should Bharata and Śatrughna be seen by you—those two, like
  brothers and sons to me, dearer to me even than my life.”
'34': >-
  “And you must never do what is displeasing to Bharata, O Vaidehī; for he is
  the king—of the realm and of the lineage as well.”
'35': >-
  “Kings, when honoured by good conduct and diligently served, become gracious;
  in the contrary case they become angry.”
'36': >-
  “For rulers cast off even their own sons if they act against their interests;
  and they take into favour even others, if they are capable and supportive.”
'37': >-
  “Therefore you, O auspicious one, should dwell here obedient to the king,
  delighting in Bharata, devoted to dharma, and intent on the vow of truth.”
'38': >-
  “I shall go to the great forest, my beloved; but you must dwell here indeed, O
  fair‑hipped lady. So act that you bring no displeasure upon anyone—thus must
  you carry out this word of mine.”
'39': >-
  Thus ends the twenty‑sixth canto of the Ayodhyā‑kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first of poets, entitled “The
  Restraining (Dissuasion) of Sītā.”
