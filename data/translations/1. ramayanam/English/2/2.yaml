  Now begins the second canto in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Assent of the Royal Council.”
'1': >-
  Then the lord of the earth, having summoned the entire council, spoke these
  well-known words—beneficial and heartening—addressing them thus.
'2': >-
  With a voice like the deep sound of a kettledrum, resounding in a grave
  reverberation, the king spoke aloud, thundering like a rain-cloud.
'3': >-
  Endowed with the marks of royalty, charming and incomparable, the lord of men
  addressed the kings in a voice rich with feeling.
'4': >-
  This is well known to you all—how this excellent kingdom of mine was cherished
  and protected by my royal forefathers as though it were their own son.
'5': >-
  And I, too—having received it thus guarded by all the Ikṣvāku kings, the lords
  of men—desire to unite it with greater prosperity, for the welfare of all the
  world that deserves happiness.
'6': >-
  Following the path trodden by the ancients, I too have ever protected the
  subjects, wakeful and vigilant, according to my utmost power.
'7': >-
  This body of mine has been worn out in moving about for the good of the whole
  world, even beneath the shade of the white royal parasol.
'8': >-
  Having lived through many thousands of years and attained many spans of life,
  I now choose rest for this body that has grown old.
'9': >-
  I am weary, bearing for the people the heavy yoke of dharma—royal power, hard
  to sustain for those whose senses are unconquered.
'10': >-
  Therefore I wish for repose, after appointing my son for the welfare of the
  subjects—having consulted and obtained the assent of all these foremost of
  twice-born sages who are near at hand.
'11': >-
  Indeed, my son is endowed with every virtue, the best of all: Rāma, conqueror
  of hostile cities, equal in prowess to Purandara (Indra).
'12': >-
  Him—like the moon joined with the auspicious constellation Puṣya, the foremost
  among bearers of dharma—I shall appoint as Yuvarāja tomorrow morning, that
  bull among men.
'13': >-
  He will be a fitting protector for you, O lords—prosperous, and the elder
  brother of Lakṣmaṇa; under whose lordship even the three worlds would become
  as though more truly possessed of a lord.
'14': >-
  By this act that brings welfare, I shall at once unite this earth with
  prosperity; and, having installed that son, I shall become free from
  affliction.
'15': >-
  Since this matter seems fitting and I have rightly deliberated upon it, may
  you approve of my intent—how else should I act?
'16': >-
  Though this is my own cherished desire, let what is beneficial be considered
  as well; for a different, neutral deliberation might give rise to conflict
  beyond measure.
'17': >-
  As he spoke thus, the kings—joyful—applauded the king, like peacocks exulting
  at a roaring rain-cloud.
'18': >-
  Then a warm, harmonious murmur arose, stirred by delight—an uproar of
  thronging voices, as though making the earth tremble.
'19': >-
  Understanding in every way the intention of that knower of dharma and artha,
  the brāhmaṇas and the foremost among the mighty, together with the townsmen
  and countryfolk,
'20': >-
  assembled to offer counsel, their minds in accord; and, having perceived the
  aged King Daśaratha’s purpose, they spoke.
'21': >-
  “For many thousands of years, O king, you have grown old. Therefore anoint
  Rāma as Yuvarāja, O lord of the earth.”
'22': >-
  “We desire to behold the mighty-armed Raghava hero, of great
  strength—Rāma—proceeding on a great elephant, his face shaded by a royal
  umbrella.”
'23': >-
  Hearing their words, so pleasing to his heart, the king—though as if unaware
  and wishing to draw them out—spoke these words:
'24': >-
  “Hearing this declaration—that you wish Rāghava to be your lord—O kings, a
  doubt arises in me. Tell me this truthfully.”
'25': >-
  “How is it that, while I rule the earth in righteousness, you still wish to
  see the mighty-armed prince as Yuvarāja?”
'26': >-
  Then those great-souled ones, together with the townsmen and countryfolk, said
  to him: “O king, many auspicious qualities are found in your son.”
'27': >-
  “The qualities of that virtuous one, O lord—of that wise prince, godlike in
  nature—dear, joy-giving, complete in every way—we shall declare today;
  listen.”
'28': >-
  “In divine qualities, Rāma is equal to Śakra (Indra), and true in valor;
  indeed, O lord of the people, he surpasses all the Ikṣvākus.”
'29': >-
  “Rāma is a good man in this world—truthful, devoted to truth. From Rāma
  himself, as it were, dharma has arisen, together with prosperity.”
'30': >-
  “In bringing happiness to his subjects he is like the moon; in forbearance he
  is like the earth; in wisdom he is equal to Bṛhaspati; in might he is truly
  like Śacī’s lord (Indra).”
'31': >-
  “He knows dharma; he is steadfast in truth; of noble conduct; free from envy;
  patient; a consoler; gentle; grateful; and one who has conquered his senses.”
'32': >-
  “He is mild and firm of mind, ever well-bred and not envious; pleasing in
  speech to living beings, and truthful in speech—the Rāghava.”
'33': >-
  “He serves the aged brāhmaṇas who are learned in many scriptures; hence his
  incomparable fame, renown, and splendor increase here.”
'34': >-
  “Among gods, asuras, and men he is skilled in all weapons; properly
  trained—having observed vows and completed studies—and a knower of the Vedas
  with their auxiliaries as prescribed.”
'35': >-
  “And in the art of Gāndharva music, Bharata’s elder brother has become the
  foremost on earth; of noble lineage, righteous, unbroken in spirit, and
  great-minded.”
'36': >-
  having gone with Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), he does not return without victory; and
  when he comes back from battle—whether on an elephant or in a chariot—
'37': >-
  he ever inquires after the welfare of the townsmen as though they were his own
  kin—about their sons, their sacred fires, their wives, and their servants and
  pupils as well.
'38': >-
  “In every respect and in due order—like a father to his own sons—he asks: ‘Do
  your disciples attend upon you? Are you properly armed in your cuirasses?’”
'39': >-
  “Thus does Rāma, that tiger among men, always address you; and in the
  misfortunes of men he becomes exceedingly grieved.”
'40': >-
  “And at all festivals he rejoices like a father; he is truthful, a great
  archer, a servant of elders, and one who has conquered his senses.”
'41': >-
  “He speaks with a smile beforehand; he has taken refuge in dharma with his
  whole self; he speaks fittingly of what is for one’s good, and has no taste
  for quarrelsome talk.”
'42': >-
  “In ever-advancing reasoned discourse he is a speaker like Vācaspati
  (Bṛhaspati) himself; with fair brows and long lotus-reddened eyes—like Viṣṇu
  in person.”
'43': >-
  “This Rāma is delightful to the world by his heroism, strength, and valor;
  devoted to protecting the subjects, with senses not overpowered by passion.”
'44': >-
  “He is able even to enjoy the three worlds—how much more this earth! Neither
  his anger nor his favor is ever without meaning.”
'45': >-
  “He slays those who deserve to be slain according to rule; upon those who
  should not be slain he does not grow wrathful. He applies means rightly, and
  is glad where he is satisfied.”
'46': >-
  “By his self-controlled qualities—beloved of all subjects, producing affection
  in men—Rāma shines forth, radiant like the sun with his rays.”
'47': >-
  “The earth longs for that Rāma—endowed with such virtues, true in valor—like a
  guardian of the world, a lord incomparable.”
'48': >-
  “Blessed indeed that son of yours, that Rāghava, has been born for the highest
  good. Fortunate are you—endowed with a son possessing virtues, like Kaśyapa
  with (his son) Mārīca.”
'49': >-
  “The strength, health, and longevity of Rāma, who knows his own self, are
  renowned among gods, asuras, and men, and among Gandharvas and serpents as
  well.”
'50': >-
  “All people in the realm, and likewise in the best of cities—both those within
  and those without—the townsmen and countryfolk—desire this.”
'51': >-
  “Women—both the aged and the young—composed in mind at evening and morning,
  all bow to the gods for Rāma’s sake, O king. May what they have thus prayed
  for, O lord, be fulfilled by your favor.”
'52': >-
  “May we behold Rāma—dark as the blue lotus, the destroyer of all
  enemies—established in the office of Yuvarāja, your most excellent royal son.”
'53': >-
  “That son of yours, O giver of boons—godlike among gods—set upon the welfare
  of the whole world: for our good, be pleased to anoint him quickly, the noble
  one, with gladness.”
'54': >-
  Thus ends the second canto, titled “The Assent of the Royal Council,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the Ādikavi.
