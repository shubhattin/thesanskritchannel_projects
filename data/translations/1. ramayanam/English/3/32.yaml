  Now begins the thirty-second canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Śūrpaṇakhā’s Endeavour.”
'1': >-
  Then Śūrpaṇakhā, beholding fourteen thousand of the rākṣasas—men of dreadful
  deeds—slain by Rāma alone,
'2': >-
  and seeing too Dūṣaṇa and Khara, and Triśiras struck down in battle, again
  raised a mighty cry, like a rain-cloud thundering.
'3': >-
  Having witnessed that deed of Rāma—an exploit most difficult for others to
  accomplish—she, exceedingly agitated, went to Laṅkā, guarded and ruled by
  Rāvaṇa.
'4': >-
  There, upon the foremost part of the aerial car, she beheld Rāvaṇa of blazing
  splendour, seated with his counsellors, like Vāsava (Indra) amid the Maruts.
'5': >-
  She saw him seated on a supreme golden throne, radiant as the sun, established
  upon a lofty golden dais, blazing like fire.
'6': >-
  He was unconquerable by the devas, gandharvas, and bhūtas, and by great-souled
  ṛṣis as well—terrible in battle, with gaping jaws like Death himself.
'7': >-
  In clashes with devas and asuras, his body bore wounds made by thunderbolts
  and lightning; his broad chest was marked with raised scars from the tips of
  Airāvata’s tusks.
'8': >-
  With twenty arms and ten heads, clad in splendid attire, broad-chested, a hero
  bearing the marks of royalty,
'9': >-
  girt with ornaments gleaming like cat’s-eye gems, adorned with ornaments of
  heated gold; strong-armed, white-toothed, great-mouthed, mountain-like—
'10': >-
  he had been struck, in hundreds of encounters in wars of the gods, by the
  descents of Viṣṇu’s discus and by other weapons and blows in mighty battles;
'11': >-
  yet all his limbs remained unhurt by those divine missiles; he was one who
  could swiftly set to churning even seas that are otherwise unshakable.
'12': >-
  He was a hurler of mountain-peaks, a crusher of the devas, an uprooter of
  righteousness, and one who violated the wives of others.
'13': >-
  He was the wielder of every celestial weapon, ever the disturber of
  sacrifices; and, having gone to the city Bhogavatī, he had subdued Vāsuki and
  defeated him.
'14': >-
  He who, having overcome Takṣaka’s beloved consort, carried her away; and who,
  having gone to Mount Kailāsa, conquered Nara-vāhana (Kubera),
'15': >-
  he who seized that one’s aerial car Puṣpaka, which moves at will; and who laid
  waste the divine Caitraratha grove, the lake of lotuses, and the Nandana
  forest—
'16': >-
  he, mighty in valour, destroys in wrath the gardens of the gods; and he, the
  afflicter of foes, checks by his arms the great and fortunate Moon and Sun as
  they rise.
'17': >-
  He, like a mountain-peak in form, restrains them by the strength of his arms;
  and having performed austerities for ten thousand years in the great forest,
'18': >-
  formerly, with steadfast resolve, he offered up his own heads to the Self-born
  (Brahmā). And to him, in battle, from devas, dānavas, gandharvas, piśācas,
  birds, and serpents,
'19': >-
  there was fearlessness—freedom from death—save only at the hands of a human
  being. He was praised with mantras as holy by twice-born priests in
  sacrificial rites;
'20': >-
  and, of great strength, he strikes down Soma in the sacrificial vessels; a
  wicked one who seizes the offerings of sacrifices—slayer of brāhmaṇas, of
  cruel deeds—
'21': >-
  harsh, without compassion, intent upon the harm of his subjects—Rāvaṇa,
  bringing dread to all beings, a terror to all the worlds.
'22': >-
  That rākṣasī beheld her own brother—cruel and of great might—adorned with
  divine garments and ornaments, and beautified by heavenly garlands.
'23': >-
  She saw that lord of rākṣasas seated firmly upon his throne, like Time at the
  end of time, arisen for destruction—the fortunate Rākṣasa-king, the delight of
  the line of Pulastya.
'24': >-
  Approaching, the rākṣasī, shaken with fear, spoke words to Rāvaṇa—the slayer
  of foes—who was surrounded by his ministers.
'25': >-
  Then she, Śūrpaṇakhā—her form disfigured by the great-souled one (Rāma)—driven
  by fear and greed, pointedly displayed (her condition) and spoke to him, whose
  vast eyes were fiery-bright, a most dreadful speech, though she herself was
  accustomed to move without fear.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-second canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “Śūrpaṇakhā’s Endeavour.”
