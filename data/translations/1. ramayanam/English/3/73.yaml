  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa,
  begins the seventy-third chapter, entitled “The Description of the Path to
  Ṛṣyamūka.”
'1': >-
  Having shown Rāma the way for the search of Sītā, the intelligent Kabandha—one
  who understood the true import of words—spoke again words fully suited to the
  purpose.
'2': >-
  “O Rāma, this is an auspicious and beneficent path—where these delightful
  trees stand in bloom, shining forth along the western direction.”
'3': >-
  “There are jambu-trees, priyāla, panasa (jackfruit), nyagrodha (banyan),
  plakṣa, tinduka, aśvattha, karnikāra, mango-trees, and many other kinds of
  trees.”
'4': >-
  “There are dhanvana trees, nāga-trees, tilaka, naktamāla, blue aśoka trees,
  kadamba, and karavīra, all laden with blossoms.”
'5': >-
  “There are also aśoka trees with blossoms like flames, and richly red
  pāribhadraka trees. Climbing them, or else forcing them down to the ground
  with strength—”
'6': >-
  “—you will eat fruits that are like nectar, and then proceed onward. Passing
  beyond that, O scion of Kakutstha, you will come to a forest filled with
  flowering trees—”
'7': >-
  “—another grove resembling Nandana, like the northern Kurus; where the trees
  bear fruit in every season, and drip sweetness.”
'8': >-
  “All seasons are found there in that forest, as in the garden of Citra-ratha;
  and there the great-branched trees bend low under the burden of their fruits.”
'9': >-
  “They shine there on every side, like mountains of clouds. Climbing them, or
  else gently bringing them down to the ground—”
'10': >-
  “—Lakṣmaṇa will give you fruits like nectar. Thus, moving on—over excellent
  mountains, from mountain to mountain, and from forest to forest—”
'11': >-
  “—you two heroic brothers will then reach the lake named Pampā: free from
  gravel and uneven ground, with level and easy landing-places, and without
  slime.”
'12': >-
  “O Rāma, its sands are newly formed, and it is adorned with lotuses and
  water-lilies. There, O Rāghava, are swans, waterfowl, krauñca birds, and
  curlews—”
'13': >-
  “—uttering sweet cries and warbling as they move about upon the waters of
  Pampā. Seeing men, they do not take fright—being gentle creatures unskilled in
  slaughter.”
'14': >-
  “Those stout birds, like lumps of ghee, you will eat. And also rohit fish, and
  fish with curved snouts, and nalamīna fish, O Rāghava.”
'15': >-
  “There in Pampā, O Rāma, you will strike down excellent fish with arrows—fish
  that are skinned, with their fins removed, roasted upon heated iron, plump,
  and without many bones.”
'16': >-
  “Lakṣmaṇa, devoted to you with reverence, will offer them to you. As you eat
  those fish amid the heaps of flowers of Pampā—”
'17': >-
  “—you will draw up the auspicious water, fragrant with lotuses—pleasantly
  cool, wholesome, and free from sickness—clear and unstained, like silver and
  crystal.”
'18': >-
  “Then Lakṣmaṇa will have you drink it using a lotus-leaf. And he will also
  give drink to stout forest-ranging monkeys who lie in mountain-caves—”
'19': >-
  “—and in the late afternoon, as you roam about, O Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa will show you
  mighty bulls, bellowing like oxen, that have turned back greedily for the
  water.”
'20': >-
  “You will see there, O best of men, great tawny monkeys in Pampā. And in the
  late afternoon, O Rāma, you will see trees whose branches bear garlands.”
'21': >-
  “Seeing the sacred waters of Pampā, you will cast aside your grief. There, the
  tilaka and naktamāla trees are decked with lovely blossoms.”
'22': >-
  “And there are fully opened blue lotuses and pink lotuses, O Rāghava; yet no
  man there strings them into garlands or places them upon anyone.”
'23': >-
  “Nor do they fade, nor do they wither away, O Rāghava. There were disciples of
  the sage Mataṅga—ṛṣis of well-collected minds—”
'24': >-
  “—who, oppressed by the burden of carrying forest-produce for their teacher,
  had sweat-drops fall swiftly to the earth from their bodies.”
'25': >-
  “From those sweat-drops, by the power of the sages’ austerity, those garlands
  came into being; and being born of sweat-drops, they do not perish, O
  Rāghava.”
'26': >-
  “Even now, though those sages have departed, their attendant is still seen
  there—an ascetic woman named Śabarī, O scion of Kakutstha, long-lived.”
'27': >-
  “Ever established in righteousness, she will behold you—reverenced by all
  beings, and godlike, O Rāma—and then she will go to the world of heaven.”
'28': >-
  “Then, O Rāma, taking refuge on the western bank of Pampā, you will see, O
  scion of Kakutstha, an incomparable hermitage-site—hidden and sacred.”
'29': >-
  “Serpents are not able to enter that hermitage, by the ordinance of that sage
  Mataṅga; and so it is with that woodland as well.”
'30': >-
  “It is famed as ‘Mataṅga’s forest,’ O delight of the Raghus. In that grove
  resembling Nandana, like a divine forest—”
'31': >-
  “—filled with many kinds of birds, you will sport, O Rāma, content and at
  ease. And in front of Pampā rises Ṛṣyamūka, with trees in blossom—”
'32': >-
  “—very difficult to climb, guarded by young serpents; a noble mountain,
  fashioned long ago by Brahmā himself.”
'33': >-
  “O Rāma, a man sleeping upon the summit of that mountain—whatever wealth he
  obtains in a dream, on waking he truly gains.”
'34': >-
  “But whoever, of perverse conduct and sinful deeds, climbs it—there itself the
  rākṣasas strike him down, seizing him while he sleeps.”
'35': >-
  “There too is heard the great clamour of the young serpents, as they play
  about, O Rāma, in the region of Mataṅga’s hermitage.”
'36': >-
  “Mighty elephants, their bodies smeared and clotted with streams of blood,
  roam about—now gathered together, now dispersed—swift and cloud-hued.”
'37': >-
  “Having drunk there pure, charming, and splendid water—whose touch is
  exceedingly pleasant and which is endowed with all fragrances—”
'38': >-
  “—the forest-roaming beasts, satisfied, plunge into the woods: and you will
  see bears, and leopards as well, of dark, tender-hued radiance.”
'39': >-
  “Seeing the deer and the goats free from fear, you will laugh away your
  sorrow. O Rāma, on that mountain a great cave shines forth—”
'40': >-
  “—closed by a slab of stone, O scion of Kakutstha, and hard to enter. At the
  eastern entrance of that cave is a great pool of cool water, delightful,
  abounding in roots and fruits, and crowded with many kinds of serpents. In
  that place dwells the righteous Sugrīva together with the monkeys.”
'41': >-
  “At times he stays upon the peak of that mountain as well.” Thus instructing
  Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa in this manner, Kabandha—
'42': >-
  “—adorned with a garland, radiant like the sun in hue, and mighty in
  prowess—shone in the sky. Seeing that fortunate one stationed aloft, Rāma and
  Lakṣmaṇa—”
'43': >-
  “—having set out, spoke to him nearby: ‘Do you go onward.’ And he said to
  them: ‘Go—so that your purpose may be accomplished.’”
'44': ''
'45': >-
  That Kabandha, attaining his own true form, shining with splendour, his entire
  body resplendent, and gazed upon by Rāma as he remained in the sky, indicated
  (the way) and then spoke: “Enter into friendship (with Sugrīva).”
'46': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-third chapter of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The
  Description of the Path to Ṛṣyamūka.”
