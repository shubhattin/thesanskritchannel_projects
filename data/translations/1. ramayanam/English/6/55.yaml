  Now begins the fifty-fifth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Battle with Akampana.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that Vajradaṁṣṭra had been slain by the son of Vāli, Rāvaṇa spoke
  these words to the commander of his forces, who stood before him with folded
  hands.
'2': >-
  “Let the invincible rākṣasas of dreadful might and terrible prowess march out
  at once, placing Akampana at their head—Akampana, skilled in every weapon and
  missile.”
'3': >-
  “He is my chastiser and my protector, my leader, and the best among warriors
  in battle; ever desirous of my prosperity, and ever devoted to the delight of
  combat.”
'4': >-
  “He will conquer the two scions of Kakutstha, and also Sugrīva of great
  strength; and he will surely slay the other fierce vānaras—of this there is no
  doubt.”
'5': >-
  Receiving that command of Rāvaṇa, the mighty one then urged on the host—he
  whose onset in battle was swift and decisive.
'6': >-
  Thereupon the foremost rākṣasas—bearing diverse weapons, with frightful eyes
  and fearsome appearance—sallied forth, impelled by the commander of the
  forces.
'7': >-
  Mounting a vast chariot adorned with ornaments of heated gold, he was like a
  cloud in hue, cloud-dark in color, and thunderous in voice like a great cloud.
'8': >-
  Surrounded by dreadful rākṣasas, Akampana then marched out—he who cannot be
  made to tremble even by the gods in a mighty battle.
'9': >-
  Then Akampana shone among them with splendor like the Sun, as he charged
  forward, enraged and eager for combat.
'10': >-
  Suddenly dejection seized the horses and the charioteers of that warrior who
  rejoiced in battle; and his left eye throbbed and quivered.
'11': >-
  His face lost its color, and his voice became faltering and broken; and though
  it was a season and time of fair days, it turned into a bleak, stormy day with
  harsh winds.
'12': >-
  All birds and beasts uttered cries—cruel and fear-inspiring; yet he,
  broad-shouldered like a lion and equal in valor to a tiger,
'13': >-
  gave no thought to those portents, and went forth to the battlefield. As that
  rākṣasa departed together with the rākṣasas,
'14': >-
  a very great roar arose, as though stirring up the ocean; and by that sound
  the great army of vānaras was terrified.
'15': >-
  As they advanced to fight, striking with trees and rocks, a most dreadful
  battle arose between the monkeys and the rākṣasas.
'16': >-
  For the sake of Rāma and Rāvaṇa, they went into battle with their lives cast
  away; all were exceedingly strong and heroic, all like mountains in stature.
'17': >-
  The monkeys and the rākṣasas, intent on slaying one another—among those
  exceedingly swift in the clash of arms, the noise of their roaring
'18': >-
  was heard as exceedingly great, as they bellowed at one another in anger; and
  dust, copper-hued, most terrible, rose thickly.
'19': >-
  Stirred up by the monkeys and the rākṣasas, it spread and obstructed all the
  ten directions; and by that dust—pale like uplifted silk—
'20': >-
  beings on the battlefield could not see one another. Neither standard nor
  banner, neither shield nor even horse
'21': >-
  could be discerned through that dust—nor weapon, nor chariot; and the great
  clamor of those roaring and charging
'22': >-
  was heard tumultuously in the battle, while forms could not be made out.
  Thinking them to be enemies, the enraged vānaras slew vānaras in the fight,
'23': >-
  and the rākṣasas also slew rākṣasas in that darkness. Thus those vānaras and
  rākṣasas, striking down foes, struck down their own as well,
'24': >-
  and they made the earth then wet with blood, smeared as with mire. Thereafter,
  by torrents of blood poured out, the dust was drenched and subsided;
'25': >-
  and the ground became strewn with bodies and corpses. With trees, spears,
  maces, darts, rocks, iron bludgeons, and javelins,
'26': >-
  the rākṣasas and the vānaras swiftly struck one another down with force—those
  mountain-like warriors fighting with arms like iron bars.
'27': >-
  The mighty-doing vānaras slew the rākṣasas in the battle; but the rākṣasas,
  exceedingly enraged, with spears and javelins in hand,
'28': >-
  struck down the monkeys there with most dreadful weapons. Akampana, greatly
  enraged, the commander of the rākṣasa host,
'29': >-
  cheered on all those rākṣasas of terrible prowess. The vānaras too, advancing,
  tore apart the rākṣasas with huge trees and mighty rocks,
'30': >-
  and with strength shattered their weapons, cutting them away. In the meantime,
  the heroic vānaras—Kumuda, Nala,
'31': >-
  Mainda, and Dvivida—enraged, put forth an unsurpassed impetus. And those great
  heroes, at the forefront of the rākṣasa army,
'32': >-
  wrought an exceedingly great slaughter with trees, as if in sport, O best of
  monkeys. They crushed all the rākṣasas fiercely with weapons of many kinds.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fifth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Battle with
  Akampana.”
