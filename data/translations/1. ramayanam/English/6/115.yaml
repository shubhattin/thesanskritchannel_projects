'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-fifteenth sarga, named “The Coronation of Vibhīṣaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Beholding the slaying of Rāvaṇa, the Devas, Gandharvas, and Dānavas departed,
  each in his own aerial car, discoursing among themselves auspicious tales.
'2': >-
  They spoke of the terrible destruction of Rāvaṇa, of Rāghava’s prowess, of the
  noble and well-fought battle, and also of Sugrīva’s wise counsel and planning
  for the hosts of Vānaras.
'3': >-
  They recounted the affection and valor of Māruti (Hanumān), and of Lakṣmaṇa;
  Sītā’s steadfastness as a devoted wife (pativratā); and the heroism displayed
  by Hanumān.
'4': >-
  Thus narrating, those greatly fortunate ones went their way, delighted, even
  as they had come. But Rāghava—
'5': >-
  that mighty-armed one—having given permission, duly honored Mātali. And
  Mātali, Indra’s charioteer, being permitted by Rāghava,
'6': >-
  mounted that divine chariot and sprang up to heaven itself. When that foremost
  of charioteers had ascended to the heavens with his chariot,
'7': >-
  Rāghava, filled with supreme joy, embraced Sugrīva. And having embraced
  Sugrīva, he was saluted by Lakṣmaṇa.
'8': >-
  Being honored by the multitude of Vānaras, he returned to the camp of the
  army. Then that son of Kakutstha spoke to him who stood near at hand—
'9': >-
  to Saumitri, Lakṣmaṇa—endowed with virtue, radiant in splendor: “O gentle one,
  anoint this Vibhīṣaṇa in Laṅkā.”
'10': >-
  “He is devoted and faithful, and also one who formerly rendered service to us.
  This is my highest desire: that this younger brother of Rāvaṇa—
'11': >-
  Vibhīṣaṇa—may I see anointed in Laṅkā.” Thus addressed by great-souled
  Rāghava, Saumitri,
'12': >-
  saying, “So be it,” and greatly rejoicing, took up a golden pitcher. Swift as
  thought, he handed that pitcher into the hands of the lords among Vānaras,
'13': >-
  and directed those mighty ones to fetch sea-water then. Thereupon those
  Vānaras, swift as the mind, went exceedingly quickly,
'14': >-
  and returned, those best of Vānaras, bearing water drawn from the ocean. Then,
  taking one pitcher, and placing it upon the most excellent seat,
'15': >-
  Saumitri anointed Vibhīṣaṇa with that pitcher—within Laṅkā, in the midst of
  the Rākṣasas—installing him as king by Rāma’s command.
'16': >-
  According to the proper rite, sanctioned by mantras as seen by the seers, and
  surrounded by the assembly of his friends, then all the Rākṣasas, and the
  Vānaras likewise, performed the anointing.
'17': >-
  Attaining incomparable delight, they praised Rāma alone. His ministers
  rejoiced, and those Rākṣasas too who were devoted to him.
'18': >-
  Seeing Vibhīṣaṇa anointed in Laṅkā as lord of the Rākṣasas, Rāghava, together
  with Lakṣmaṇa, attained supreme joy.
'19': >-
  And Vibhīṣaṇa, having obtained that great kingdom bestowed by Rāma, after
  reassuring the citizens and subjects, then approached Rāma.
'20': >-
  Then, delighted, the night-ranging citizens brought for him curds, unhusked
  rice, sweetmeats, parched grains, and also flowers of good fragrance.
'21': >-
  Taking those things, the unassailable and valorous one presented them to
  Rāghava, and likewise all auspicious offerings—auspiciousness itself—to
  Lakṣmaṇa.
'22': >-
  Seeing Vibhīṣaṇa with his purpose accomplished and his aims fulfilled, Rāma
  accepted all of that—indeed out of regard for him, fulfilling his wish.
'23': >-
  Thereafter, Rāma spoke these words to Hanumān, the monkey, seeing him—heroic
  like a mountain—standing with joined palms, bowed in reverence:
'24': >-
  “Having taken leave of this great king, O gentle one—this Vibhīṣaṇa—enter the
  city of Laṅkā and speak to Maithilī of our welfare.”
'25': >-
  “Tell Vaidehī of my well-being, and of Sugrīva’s, and of Lakṣmaṇa’s; and, O
  best among speakers, declare that Rāvaṇa has been slain in battle.”
'26': >-
  “Relate this pleasing news here to Vaidehī, O lord among Vānaras; and having
  received her message, you should return.”
'27': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-fifteenth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the holy
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Coronation of Vibhīṣaṇa.”
