  Now begins the thirty-ninth sarga (chapter), named “The Encampment of the
  Army,” in the Kishkindha-kanda of the glorious Valmiki Ramayana.
'1': >-
  Thus spoke Sugriva; and Rama, foremost among the upholders of dharma,
  embracing him with both arms, replied with joined palms (in respectful
  salutation).
'2': >-
  If Indra were to pour down rain in the season of rains, that would not be a
  matter of wonder; and that thousand-rayed Sun may indeed make the sky free of
  darkness.
'3': >-
  The Moon may make the night bright with his gentle, stainless radiance; and
  one such as you, O scorcher of foes, may surely bring gladness to his friends.
'4': >-
  Thus, in your case it is no marvel if what is pleasing and auspicious comes to
  pass, O gentle one. I know you, Sugriva, to be ever one who speaks what is
  dear and agreeable.
'5': >-
  With you as my protector, O friend, in battle I shall conquer all my enemies.
  You alone are my well-wishing friend and ally; you are worthy to render me
  assistance.
'6': >-
  That vilest of rakshasas carried off Maithili for his own
  destruction—deceiving her, as Anuhlada once deceived Paulomi (Indra’s
  daughter) Shachi.
'7': >-
  Before long I shall slay that Ravana with keen-pointed arrows—just as
  Shatakratu (Indra), the foe-slayer, slew the arrogant father of Paulomi.
'8': >-
  Meanwhile, a cloud of dust rose up; and the thousand-rayed Sun’s radiance in
  the sky was veiled by that fierce and scorching haze.
'9': >-
  The quarters were thrown into confusion and were tainted by that darkness of
  dust; and the whole earth shook—together with its mountains, forests, and
  groves.

  Then the entire ground was covered by countless monkeys—mighty, with sharp
  fangs, resembling lords of mountains.

  attended by hundreds of crores—leaders of the monkey multitudes.

  collyrium—surrounded by ten crores.

  surrounded by five crores.
'24': >-

  Then Ghandhamadana arrived, followed from behind by a thousand of thousands of
  crores of monkeys.

  monkeys besides, able to assume forms at will—(were present).
'39': >-
  Covering the entire earth, and the mountains and forests, the host-leaders
  arrived—whose number cannot be known.
'40': >-
  All the monkeys came and took their places upon the earth—leaping, vaulting,
  and roaring. They surged toward Sugriva like masses of clouds toward the sun.
'41': >-
  Making many mighty sounds, those excellent, strong-armed ones bowed their
  heads and made their report to Sugriva, lord of monkeys.
'42': >-
  Other foremost monkeys too assembled as was proper; having met with Sugriva,
  they stood then with joined palms.
'43': >-
  Sugriva, hastening, presented all those chief bulls among monkeys to Rama;
  then, the knower of dharma, standing with joined palms, spoke.
'44': >-
  “Having duly encamped the forces at ease in the mountain-streams and in all
  the forests, the knower of armies wishes to set about the proper disposition
  of the army.”
