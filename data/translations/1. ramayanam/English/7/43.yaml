  Now begins, in the sacred, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa,
  the forty-third sarga, called “Hearing the Words of Bhadra.”
'1': >-
  There, as the king sat, discerning men—makers of witty and humorous tales of
  many kinds—waited upon him on every side.
'2': >-
  Vijaya, Madhumatta, and Kāśyapa; Maṅgala, Kuṭa; Surāja, Kāliya, Bhadra;
  Dantavakra, and Sumāgadha—
'3': >-
  These, delighted and full of mirth, narrated to the great-souled Rāghava many
  kinds of stories, embellished with pleasantry and jest.
'4': >-
  Then, in the course of some tale, Rāghava spoke: “O Bhadra, what reports and
  sayings are current in the city and throughout the provinces?
'5': >-
  What do the townsmen and country-folk say of those who have taken refuge in
  me—of me; and what, with regard to Sītā; what also, regarding Bharata and
  Lakṣmaṇa?
'6': >-
  And what, indeed, do they say concerning Śatrughna; what regarding Kaikeyī;
  and what, O king, do they speak as ought to be spoken, both when I bestow
  boons and when I proceed in matters of governance?”
'7': >-
  When Rāma had thus spoken, Bhadra, with joined palms, replied: “Sire,
  tales—auspicious in form—are indeed current among the inhabitants of the city.
'8': >-
  But this victory of yours, gentle lord—won by the slaying of Daśagrīva—is what
  the citizens of your own city recount the most, O bull among men.
'9': >-
  Thus addressed by Bhadra, Rāghava said: “Tell me everything exactly as it
  truly is—fully, leaving nothing out.
'10': >-
  Whether the words the city-dwellers speak are auspicious or
  inauspicious—having heard them now, I shall do what is auspicious, and I shall
  not do what is inauspicious.”
'11': >-
  “Speak freely—without hesitation—fearless and free from anxiety; relate it as
  the townsmen speak, and as even sinful men in the countryside speak.”
'12': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāghava, Bhadra—offering words pleasing and apt—answered the
  mighty-armed one with joined palms, composed and attentive.
'13': >-
  “Hear, O king, how the townsmen speak of what is auspicious and
  inauspicious—in the squares, in the marketplaces, in the streets, and in
  forests and pleasure-groves as well.
'14': >-
  ‘Rāma has accomplished a deed hard to accomplish: the binding of a bridge over
  the ocean—something unheard of by any before, even by the gods together with
  the Dānavas.
'15': >-
  And Rāvaṇa, difficult to assail, has been slain along with his forces and
  conveyances; and the monkeys and the bears were brought under command,
  together with the Rākṣasas.’
'16': >-
  ‘And having slain Rāvaṇa in battle and recovered Sītā, Rāghava—setting wrath
  behind him—brought her back again to his own dwelling.
'17': >-
  What kind of joy, born of union with Sītā, can there be in his heart—after he
  has taken into his lap her who formerly was seized by force by Rāvaṇa?'
'18': >-
  ‘She who was formerly carried even to Laṅkā, who went to the Aśoka-grove, who
  fell under the control of the Rākṣasas—how does Rāma not despise her?'
'19': >-
  ‘Then for our own wives as well such endurance will come to be; for as the
  king acts, so do the people follow him.’
'20': >-
  Thus, many kinds of words do the city-dwellers speak—in all the towns, O king,
  and throughout the countryside as well.”
'21': >-
  Hearing him speak thus, Rāghava was struck with deepest anguish, and said to
  all his friends: “How can you say this to me?”
'22': >-
  Then all of them, bowing their heads to the ground, saluting and paying
  obeisance, answered the sorrowing Rāghava: “So it is indeed—there is no
  doubt.”
'23': >-
  Having heard the statement spoken by them all, Kakutstha—the slayer of
  foes—then dismissed his companions.
'24': >-
  Thus ends the forty-third sarga of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the sacred ancient epic, entitled “Hearing the Words of Bhadra.”
