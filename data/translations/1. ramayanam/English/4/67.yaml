  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-seventh chapter, called “The Resolve for the Leap.”
'1': >-
  Seeing that foremost of monkeys swelling himself up, preparing to traverse a
  hundred yojanas, and filling out with speed all at once,
'2': >-
  they, casting away their grief in an instant and filled with delight, cried
  out and praised mighty Hanumān.
'3': >-
  Rejoicing and amazed, they looked upon him from every side—like subjects
  beholding Nārāyaṇa as Trivikrama, of renewed heroic resolve.
'4': >-
  While being extolled, mighty Hanumān grew still more in stature; and, whirling
  his tail about, through joy he came into greater strength.
'5': >-
  As he was being praised by the aged leaders among the monkeys, and as his
  splendour continued to swell, his form became unsurpassed.
'6': >-
  As a lion opens wide in a yawn within a mountain-cave, so at that moment did
  the son born of the Wind-god’s very body yawn forth.
'7': >-
  The face of that wise one, as he yawned, shone—radiant like the sky, like fire
  without smoke.
'8': >-
  Rising from the midst of the monkeys, his hairs standing on end in rapture,
  Hanumān bowed to the elder monkeys and spoke these words:
'9': >-
  The Wind, moving through the sky—mighty, immeasurable, companion of
  fire—shatters the peaks of mountains as he rushes on.
'10': >-
  I am the son born of that great-souled Māruta’s very body; and in leaping I am
  equal to him—swift in speed and swift in going.
'11': >-
  Indeed I could, without any contact, circle Mount Meru a thousand times, as
  though tracing across the wide-spread sky.
'12': >-
  With the force driven by my arms, I could set the ocean in motion and inundate
  the world with its mountains, rivers, and lakes.
'13': >-
  By the force of my mighty thighs and legs, the ocean—Varuṇa’s abode—would rise
  up, with its great crocodiles lifted together.
'14': >-
  I am able to circle Vainateya a thousand times—Garuda, whom birds attend, who
  flies through the sky, and who is the devourer of serpents—as he falls upon
  them.
'15': >-
  I could even go to the sun that has set out from the eastern mountain, blazing
  and garlanded with rays, before he has reached his setting.
'16': >-
  And then, without touching the earth, I could return again with that same
  tremendous, terrible speed, O bull-like heroes among monkeys.
'17': >-
  I could overtake all who move in the sky; I shall dry up oceans; I shall split
  the earth.
'18': >-
  As I leap, I shall crush mountains to powder; and, leaping with vast speed, I
  shall carry away the great ocean itself.
'19': >-
  The many kinds of blossoms of creepers, and the flowers of trees everywhere,
  will today follow after me as I leap through the sky.
'20': >-
  My path will indeed be like the path of Svāti in the heavens—moving through
  the dreadful sky as I spring upward.
'21': >-
  All beings will see me as I descend, O monkeys; behold me—vast like great
  Meru—as I fall.
'22': >-
  Covering the sky as I go, as though swallowing the firmament, I shall scatter
  the clouds, shake the mountains, and, leaping with steadfast intent, dry up
  the ocean.
'23': >-
  Except for Suparṇa, king of birds, and for Māruta of great might—whether it be
  Vainateya’s power, or mine, or the Wind-god’s—I see no being that could follow
  me when I have leapt forth.
'24': >-
  In but the space of a wink, through the unsupported sky, I shall suddenly
  plunge down—like lightning springing forth from a cloud.
'25': >-
  When I am leaping over the ocean, my form will be like that of Viṣṇu when he
  strides—like those three strides of Trivikrama.
'26': >-
  By my understanding I perceive it thus, and so too is my mind’s endeavour: I
  shall behold Vaidehī. Rejoice, O monkeys!
'27': >-
  Equal to Māruta in speed, equal to Garuḍa in swiftness—such is my resolve: I
  shall go ten thousand yojanas.
'28': >-
  Or else, from the very hand of Vāsava with his thunderbolt—or of Brahmā the
  Self-born—I would suddenly seize that nectar and bring it here.
'29': >-
  And it is my thought that I could even uproot Laṅkā and go away with her.”
  Thus roared that best of monkeys, of immeasurable splendour.
'30': >-
  There the monkeys, delighted, looked on in amazement; and hearing his words,
  which would destroy the grief of their kinsmen,
'31': >-
  Jāmbavān, the lord of the monkey-host, exceedingly rejoiced, spoke: “Hero, son
  of Keśarī—swift one, offspring of the Wind-god!
'32': >-
  The vast sorrow of your kinsmen has been dispelled by you, dear child; the
  leaders among monkeys, whose eyes are set on your welfare, have assembled
  here.
'33': >-
  Intent and composed, they will perform auspicious rites for the sake of the
  task’s success—by the grace of the Ṛṣis and by the wise counsel of the aged
  monkeys.
'34': >-
  And by the favour of your elders, leap across the great ocean! We shall stand
  here on one foot until your return.”
'35': >-
  For the lives of all the forest-dwellers depend upon your going.” Then that
  tiger among monkeys spoke to those forest-dwellers:
'36': >-
  “No one in the world shall be able to check my speed in leaping. Here are
  these rocky, crag-filled heights of this mountain,
'37': >-
  the great and steadfast summits of Mahendra—upon which I shall gather my
  momentum, on Mahendra’s peaks.”
'38': >-
  “Scattered with many kinds of trees, shining with streams of mineral
  ores—these great summits indeed will sustain my speed as I leap a hundred
  yojanas from here.”
'39': >-
  Then that monkey, like the Wind in prowess—the son of the Wind-god, crusher of
  foes—climbed upon Mahendra, best of mountains.
'40': >-
  It was covered with flowers of many kinds, its meadows frequented by deer;
  thick with creepers and blossoms; with trees ever bearing flowers and fruits.
'41': >-
  It was inhabited by lions and tigers, resorted to by rutting elephants;
  resounding with the cries of intoxicated flocks of birds; and filled with
  sprays and rushes of water.
'42': >-
  Upon that Mahendra with its lofty, towering peaks, the mighty one—the best of
  monkeys, equal to Mahendra in stride—roamed about.
'43': >-
  Pressed by his feet, that great mountain, struck as though by a lion, roared
  aloud like a huge rutting elephant.
'44': >-
  Its rock-masses were scattered, and it released spurts of water; its deer and
  elephants were terrified; its great trees were shaken.
'45': >-
  With various pairs of Gandharvas, roughened from the contact of drink; and
  with birds taking sudden flight; and with hosts of Vidyādharas as well,
'46': >-
  its vast slopes being abandoned and its great serpents lying low—there came to
  that great mountain a shower of rocks hurled from its peaks.
'47': >-
  Then, with the serpents half-emerging and hissing, that mountain seemed, at
  that time, as though adorned with banners.
'48': >-
  Abandoned by Ṛṣis who were startled and agitated with fear, that heap of rocks
  sank down into the great wilderness, like a traveller bereft of his caravan.
'49': >-
  That swift foremost of monkeys—slayer of enemy heroes—his mind steadied in
  speed, and his heart composed, great in power—set his mind upon Laṅkā and went
  thither in thought, the resolute one.
'50': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-seventh chapter in the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, called “The Resolve for the Leap.”
