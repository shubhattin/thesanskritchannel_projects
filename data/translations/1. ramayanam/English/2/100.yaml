  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the hundredth
  chapter, called “Kaccit-sarga” (“Is it well?”).
'1': >-
  Rāma beheld Bharata—his matted hair unkempt, clad in bark-garments, with palms
  joined in reverence, fallen upon the earth—hard to look upon, like the sun at
  the end of an aeon.
'2': >-
  Recognizing him with difficulty—his face pale and drained of colour, his body
  emaciated—Rāma embraced his brother Bharata with his arm.
'3': >-
  The Rāghava, having smelt his head and tightly clasped him, lifted Bharata
  onto his lap, and, composed in mind, questioned him.
'4': >-
  “Where is your father, dear child, that you have come to the forest? For while
  he yet lives, you ought not to have come to the wilderness.”
'5': >-
  “After long indeed do I behold Bharata coming from afar. In this dread and
  forbidding forest, why, dear child, have you come?”
'6': >-
  “Does the king still live, dear child, since you have come here? Has the king
  not, all at once, gone to the world beyond, in misery?”
'7': >-
  “Gentle one—has your kingdom, the hereditary realm of the prince, remained
  unshaken and intact?”
'8': >-
  “Dear child—do you duly render obedience and service to your father of
  truthful valour?”
'9': >-
  “Is King Daśaratha well—true in battle, the performer of Rājasūya and
  Aśvamedha sacrifices, steadfast in dharma and in right resolve?”
'10': >-
  “And is that learned Brāhmaṇa—ever devoted to dharma, of great splendour—the
  preceptor of the Ikṣvākus, honoured, dear child, as is fitting?”
'11': >-
  “Dear child, are Kausalyā and Sumitrā, blessed with children, happy? And does
  the noble queen Kaikeyī rejoice?”
'12': >-
  “Is your purohita (royal priest) well—endowed with discipline, a high-born man
  learned in many scriptures, free from envy, impartial in judgement, and
  honoured?”
'13': >-
  “Is there among you, engaged in the sacred fires, one who knows the rites—wise
  and upright—who ever, at the proper time, makes known what has been offered
  and what is to be offered?”
'14': >-
  “Dear child, do you show due reverence to the gods, to the fathers (manes), to
  mother, to teachers, to elders who are as fathers, and to physicians, and to
  Brāhmaṇas as well?”
'15': >-
  “Do you, dear child, hold in esteem that preceptor Sudhanvan—endowed with
  excellent skill in bows and weapons, and well-versed in the science of polity
  and wealth (arthaśāstra)?”
'16': >-
  “Have you appointed as your counsellors, dear child, men brave and equal to
  yourself—learned, self-controlled, of good lineage, and skilled in reading
  men’s intentions and signs?”
'17': >-
  “For counsel, O Rāghava, is indeed the root of victory for kings—when it is
  well-guarded by ministers and counsellors learned in the śāstras.”
'18': >-
  “Have you not given yourself over to sleep? Do you awaken at the proper time?
  And in the latter part of the night, do you reflect upon skill in matters of
  policy and gain?”
'19': >-
  “Do you not deliberate alone? And do you not deliberate with too many? Does
  your consulted counsel not run abroad through the kingdom?”
'20': >-
  “Having ascertained the matter—small in its beginning yet great in its
  result—do you set about it swiftly, and not procrastinate, O Rāghava?”
'21': >-
  “Do the kings—those engaged in all affairs—know clearly what should be done by
  you, and what should not be done, whether already accomplished in proper form
  or yet to be accomplished?”
'22': >-
  “Is what has been deliberated, dear child, understood by you—or by your
  ministers—by reasoning and sound argument, and also by those means that are
  not openly spoken of?”
'23': >-
  “Do you prefer one wise man to a thousand fools? For the wise, in times of
  difficulty in matters of state, can bring about great welfare.”
'24': >-
  “Even if a king attends upon thousands of fools—or even tens of
  thousands—there is no help to be found among them.”
'25': >-
  “Even a single minister—intelligent, brave, capable, discerning—can bring
  great prosperity to a king, or even to a mere prince.”
'26': >-
  “Have you assigned servants to tasks appropriately—placing the foremost in
  great affairs, the middling in middling affairs, and the lowliest in lowly
  affairs?”
'27': >-
  “Do you employ in offices those ministers who have been tested and found free
  from deceit—men of pure conduct, inherited from father and
  grandfather—assigning the best to the best of tasks?”
'28': >-
  “Do your ministers, O son of Kaikeyī, approve your kingdom as not being
  harshly terrified by cruel punishments and excessive severity?”
'29': >-
  “Do not the sacrificers and priests despise you—like one fallen from
  righteousness—one who takes gifts fiercely, or like women despise a man who
  pursues mere desire?”
'30': >-
  “A physician skilled in remedies, yet intent on corrupting servants; a warrior
  who longs for sovereignty—if such a one is not slain, he is himself to be
  slain.”
'31': >-
  “Have you appointed as commander of the army one who is bold and brave,
  intelligent and steadfast, pure, of noble birth, devoted, and competent?”
'32': >-
  “Are your chief warriors mighty and well-practised in war—men who have proved
  their valour and are courageous—honoured and respected by you after due
  appreciation?”
'33': >-
  “Do you give the army its rations and wages as is fitting, at the proper time
  when they are due, and do you not delay?”
'34': >-
  “For by delaying beyond the proper time in rations and wages, servants grow
  angry with their master and turn hostile; that is deemed a very great
  calamity.”
'35': >-
  “Are all your leading men—especially the high-born sons of noble
  houses—devoted to you? And do they, resolute, surrender even their lives for
  your sake?”
'36': >-
  “Have you, Bharata, appointed as your envoy a learned man—one versed in the
  ways of the country, skilful, quick-witted, speaking precisely as instructed,
  and wise?”
'37': >-
  “By spies unknown to others, three by three, do you know truly the sacred
  centres and strategic places—those within the eighteen matters, and also
  within your own side, the ten and the five?”
'38': >-
  “Do you always deal wisely—never despising the weak—with enemies who have been
  driven off, and with those who return again, O subduer of foes?”
'39': >-
  “Dear child, do you not serve those Brāhmaṇas who are mere sophists of worldly
  logic? For they are clever in what brings misfortune—mere boys who imagine
  themselves wise.”
'40': >-
  “When the principal dharma-śāstras are available, those dull-witted men,
  having taken up the science of disputation (ānvīkṣikī), speak only what is
  fruitless.”
'41': >-
  “That Ayodhyā—formerly inhabited by heroes, guarded by our forefathers—true to
  its name, with strong gates, crowded with elephants, horses, and chariots—”
'42': >-
  “—filled by the thousands with noble men: Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas, and Vaiśyas,
  ever engaged in their own duties; self-controlled and of great energy—”
'43': >-
  “—enclosed by palaces of many forms, thronged with physicians and healers—do
  you protect that prosperous and joyful Ayodhyā?”
'44': >-
  “Adorned with hundreds of shrines and funeral memorials, well-settled and
  crowded with people, beautified with temples, water-sheds, and ponds—”
'45': >-
  “—gladdened with men and women, splendid with assemblies and festivals,
  possessing well-ploughed boundaries and abundant cattle, and free from acts of
  violence—”
'46': >-
  “—charming, not without reverence to gods and mother; free from wild beasts;
  rid of every fear; and adorned with mines—”
'47': >-
  “—kept safe by my forefathers, and free from sinful men—does that flourishing
  countryside dwell in comfort, O Rāghava?”
'48': >-
  “Are all who are dear to you—those who live by agriculture and the protection
  of cattle—content? For a people supported by trade and livelihood indeed
  prospers happily, dear child.”
'49': >-
  “By protections and remissions (of burdens), have you provided for their
  maintenance? For all who dwell within the realm are to be protected by the
  king according to dharma.”
'50': >-
  “Do you comfort women, and are they protected? Do you not distrust them? And
  do you not speak of their secrets?”
'51': >-
  “Is your elephant-forest well-guarded? Do you have herds of milch-cows? And do
  you not take delight in gamblers, dogs, and elephants (in wasteful
  indulgence)?”
'52': >-
  “Do you show yourself daily to the people, adorned, O prince—rising again and
  again in the forenoon upon the great public road?”
'53': >-
  “Are not all your undertakings carried out directly under your eye, without
  suspicion—or, on the other hand, are they not all left entirely to others? The
  middle course here is the proper reason.”
'54': >-
  “Are all your forts fully supplied—with wealth, grain, weapons, and water;
  with engines; and likewise with artisans and bowmen?”
'55': >-
  “Is your revenue abundant, and your expenditure comparatively small? And does
  your treasury, O Rāghava, not go to the undeserving?”
'56': >-
  “Does your expenditure go to the worship of the gods, to rites for the
  fathers, to Brāhmaṇas who come as guests, to warriors, and to the circle of
  allies?”
'57': >-
  “Is any noble, pure-hearted man—falsely accused on a charge of theft—though
  unasked and untried by judges skilled in the śāstras, not slain out of greed?”
'58': >-
  “And is a thief—when seized, questioned, and seen at the proper time with
  evidence and cause—never released out of greed for money, O bull among men?”
'59': >-
  “In times of calamity, do your well-instructed ministers look after the wealth
  of the rich, and also of those in distress, O Rāghava—without aversion or
  partiality?”
'60': >-
  “Those tears that fall from persons falsely accused, O Rāghava—those tears
  strike down the sons and cattle of the ruler who governs for the sake of
  favour.”
'61': >-
  “Do you, O Rāghava, cherish elders and children, and foremost physicians—by
  giving, by mind, and by speech—by these three?”
'62': >-
  “Do you bow to teachers and elders, ascetics, divine guests, all sacred
  shrines, those who have attained their aims, and Brāhmaṇas?”
'63': >-
  “Do you not, O best of men, obstruct dharma by artha, or artha by dharma—nor
  both—through fondness for pleasure, greed, or desire?”
'64': >-
  “Do you, O best of conquerors, knowing time and season, duly apportion and
  serve—at the proper times—dharma, artha, and kāma, O giver of boons?”
'65': >-
  “Do the Brāhmaṇas—peaceful, knowing the meaning of all śāstras—together with
  the townsmen and countryfolk, wish you well, O great sage in counsel?”
'66': >-
  “Atheism, falsehood, anger, negligence, procrastination, not consulting the
  wise, sloth, and serving many masters—”
'67': >-
  “brooding on only one aspect of affairs, taking counsel with men who do not
  discern misfortune, not commencing what has been decided, and not guarding
  counsel—”
'68': >-
  “neglect of auspicious observances, and failure to rise in respect toward
  all—do you avoid these fourteen royal faults?”
'69': >-
  “Do you truly understand the ten and the five of the fourfold aims, and the
  sevenfold group, and the eightfold group, and the threefold group—and the
  three sciences, O Rāghava?”
'70': >-
  “Knowing the conquest of the senses; the six measures of policy (ṣāḍguṇya),
  divine and human; the group of twenty practical duties; and likewise the
  circle of constituent powers—”
'71': >-
  “the conduct of expeditions and the ordering of punishment; and the two
  alternatives—peace and hostility (alliance and conflict)—do you, O great wise
  one, approve and practise all these in due manner?”
'72': >-
  “Do you take counsel with ministers as prescribed—either four, or
  three—consulting with them together and separately, and deliberating
  mutually?”
'73': >-
  “Are your Vedas fruitful? Are your rites fruitful? Are your wives fruitful
  (blessed and auspicious)? Is your learning fruitful?”
'74': >-
  “Is this indeed your understanding—such as I have spoken, O Rāghava—conducive
  to long life and to fame, and grounded in dharma, kāma, and artha?”
'75': >-
  “Do you follow, dear child, that conduct which our father follows, and which
  our great-grandfathers followed—that conduct which is auspicious and walks the
  good path?”
'76': >-
  “Do you not eat alone food that has been well and pleasantly prepared, O
  Rāghava? And do you grant gifts to friends who look to you with hope?”
'77': >-
  “But a king, of great understanding, bearing the rod of justice, having
  protected his subjects by dharma, gains the whole earth as is fitting; and
  when he departs from here, the wise one attains heaven.”
'78': >-
  Thus ends the hundredth chapter of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “Kaccit-sarga” (“Is it well?”).
