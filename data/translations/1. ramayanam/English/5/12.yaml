  Then, in the holy, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara Kāṇḍa, begins
  the twelfth sarga, named “Hanumān’s Despondency.”
'1': >-
  Standing in the midst of that palace—among its bowers draped with creepers,
  its wondrous mansions, its night-chambers—he went about, eager to behold Sītā;
  yet he did not see her, she of lovely presence.
'2': >-
  Thereupon the mighty monkey pondered, not beholding that beloved consort of
  Raghunandana: “Surely Sītā is not here; thus it is that, though I search, the
  Maithilī does not come within my sight.”
'3': >-
  “Jānakī—ever intent on guarding her own noble conduct—may, by that foremost of
  rākṣasas and by his wicked deed, have surely been slain, though she stood firm
  on the path of the noble.”
'4': >-
  Having seen those women of the rākṣasa-king—hideous in form, distorted, of
  ugly complexion, with great mouths, long and dreadful in appearance—Janaka’s
  daughter may have perished through fear.
'5': >-
  “Not having seen Sītā, and not having achieved success by valour, having
  wasted time for long together with the vānaras—there is for me no course to go
  back to Sugrīva; that mighty monkey is stern in punishment.”
'6': >-
  “I have seen the entire inner palace; I have seen the women of Rāvaṇa. The
  chaste Sītā is not to be seen—my toil has been in vain.”
'7': >-
  “What indeed will all the vānaras, assembled together, say of me when I
  return—‘Having gone there, O hero, what did you accomplish? Tell us that.’”
'8': >-
  “Not having seen her, what shall I say—I who have not found Janaka’s daughter?
  Surely, when the appointed time has passed, I shall resort to fasting unto
  death.”
'9': >-
  “And what will the aged Jāmbavān say, and that Aṅgada as well, when the
  vānaras have gathered together after reaching the far shore of the ocean?”
'10': >-
  “Freedom from despondency is the root of prosperity; freedom from despondency
  is supreme happiness. Once more shall I strive there—where the search has not
  yet been made.”
'11': >-
  “For steadfast absence of despair is ever the impeller in all undertakings; it
  makes fruitful whatever act a creature performs.”
'12': >-
  “Therefore I shall exert myself in the best endeavour that banishes
  despondency; and I shall search even those places guarded by Rāvaṇa which have
  not yet been seen.”
'13': >-
  He searched the drinking-halls, and likewise the flower-houses; he searched
  the painted galleries, and again the sporting-houses.
'14': >-
  The lanes within the precincts, and the various aerial mansions
  everywhere—thus reflecting, he again set about to search.
'15': >-
  Leaping up and alighting, standing still and again going somewhere, he
  searched the subterranean chambers, the shrines, and even house after house.
'16': >-
  Uncovering the doorways and striking the door-panels, entering and again
  rushing out—now darting down, now springing up, as though in flight—he moved
  about.
'17': >-
  The mighty monkey ranged through every open space: in that inner palace of
  Rāvaṇa there was not even a space of four fingers’ breadth that existed which
  the monkey did not go to.
'18': >-
  The streets within the ramparts, the platforms attached to shrines, the moats,
  and the lotus-ponds—everything was looked over by him.
'19': >-
  Women rākṣasas of diverse shapes—hideous and deformed—were seen there by
  Hanumān; but not that daughter of Janaka.
'20': >-
  Women of the Vidyādharas, matchless in beauty in the world, were seen there by
  Hanumān; but not the beloved of Rāghava.
'21': >-
  Nāga maidens of fair hips, their faces like the full moon, were seen there by
  Hanumān; but not that daughter of Janaka.
'22': >-
  Nāga maidens seized by force after being overpowered by the lord of rākṣasas
  were seen there by Hanumān; she—Janaka’s daughter—was not among them.
'23': >-
  Not seeing her, though seeing other excellent women, the long-armed Hanumān,
  son of the Wind-god, sank into deep dejection.
'24': >-
  Beholding the efforts of the lords of vānaras and the crossing of the ocean to
  have become fruitless, the son of the Wind again fell into anxious thought.
'25': >-
  Descending from the aerial car, Hanumān, son of the Wind, then gave way to
  anxiety, his mind smitten by sorrow.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the twelfth sarga, named “Hanumān’s Despondency,” in the Sundara
  Kāṇḍa of the holy, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Primeval Epic.
