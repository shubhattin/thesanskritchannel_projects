  Now begins the ninetieth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Combat of Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) with Rāvaṇi (Indrajit).”
'1': >-
  Then, seeing those two—man and rākṣasa—locked in uninterrupted combat, seeking
  each other’s defeat, they appeared like two maddened elephants, each striving
  for victory over the other.
'2': >-
  Desiring to behold their battle, the mighty hero—Rāvaṇa’s brother—bearing an
  excellent bow, stood firm at the forefront of the battle.
'3': >-
  Then, standing poised, he twanged his great bow, and discharged mighty arrows
  with razor-sharp points among the rākṣasas.
'4': >-
  Those well-aimed arrows, like the touch of fire, fell upon them and drove the
  rākṣasas away, as thunderbolts shatter lofty mountains.
'5': >-
  Vibhīṣaṇa’s followers also, foremost among rākṣasas, in the battle cut down
  the rākṣasa warriors with spears, swords, and sharp pattisas.
'6': >-
  Surrounded then by those rākṣasas, Vibhīṣaṇa shone amidst the bold assailants
  like a lordly elephant among a herd of young elephants.
'7': >-
  Then, urging on the vānaras who delighted in slaying rākṣasas, the best of
  rākṣasas—knower of the right moment—spoke timely words.
'8': >-
  “This one alone remains as the rākṣasa-king’s chief reliance—this is the
  remainder of his host. Why do you stand still, O lords of the vānaras?”
'9': >-
  “When this sinful one is slain here at the head of battle, then—Rāvaṇa alone
  excepted—the rest of his strength will have been destroyed.”
'10': >-
  “Prahasta, that heroic warrior, has been slain; and Nikumbha, of great might;
  and Kumbhakarṇa; and Kumbha; and Dhūmrākṣa, the night-ranger.”
'11': >-
  “Jambumālī, Mahāmālī, Tīkṣṇavega, Aśaniprabha; Suptaghna, Yajñakopa, and the
  rākṣasa Vajradaṁṣṭra.”
'12': >-
  “Saṁhrādī, Vikaṭa, Arighna, Tapana, and likewise Manda; Praghāsa and Praghāsa;
  Prajaṅgha and Jaṅgha as well.”
'13': >-
  “Agniketu, the unconquerable; and Rasmiketu, full of prowess; Vidyujjihva,
  Dvijihva, and the rākṣasa Sūryaśatru.”
'14': >-
  “Akampana and Supārśva; and Cakramālī the rākṣasa; Kampana too; and those
  mighty ones, Devāntaka and Narāntaka.”
'15': >-
  “Having slain these exceedingly powerful and many foremost rākṣasas, you have
  crossed the ocean by your own arms—now let this remaining task be leapt over
  as a small cow’s hoof-print.”
'16': >-
  “This much alone remains for you to conquer, O vānaras. All the rākṣasas,
  puffed up with the pride of strength, have assembled—only to be slain.”
'17': >-
  “It is not fitting for me to bring about the death of my elder brother’s son.
  Casting aside my compassion for Rāma’s sake, I would slay my brother’s child.”
'18': >-
  “Though I desire to kill him, tears restrain my eyes. That mighty-armed
  Lakṣmaṇa himself will bring him to an end.”
'19': >-
  Thus urged by that illustrious rākṣasa, the vānaras cried, “Strike together at
  his attendants who are near him!”
'20': >-
  The monkey-lords rejoiced, and brandished their tails. Then those tiger-like
  monkeys, roaring again and again, let loose various cries—like peacocks on
  beholding clouds.
'21': >-
  Jāmbavān too, surrounded by all his own troop, struck the rākṣasas with rocks,
  and tore at them with nails and teeth.
'22': >-
  Seeing the lord of bears slaying them, those rākṣasas of great strength,
  abandoning fear, encompassed him, bearing weapons of many kinds.
'23': >-
  With arrows, sharp axes, pattisas, clubs, and tomaras, they struck Jāmbavān in
  the fight, even as he was striking down the rākṣasa host.
'24': >-
  There arose a tumultuous and dreadful clash between monkeys and rākṣasas, like
  the terrible great-roaring battle of enraged gods and asuras.
'25': >-
  Hanumān also, filled with wrath, tore up a sāla tree from the mountain; and
  that great-souled one, having placed Lakṣmaṇa upon his back,
'26': >-
  wrought slaughter among the rākṣasas by the thousands, being hard to assail.
  And the mighty Indrajit, Rāvaṇa’s nephew, having given his uncle a fierce
  battle,
'27': >-
  again rushed towards Lakṣmaṇa, the slayer of hostile heroes. Then those two
  heroes—Lakṣmaṇa and the rākṣasa—fought in that combat.
'28': >-
  Pouring forth torrents of arrows, they struck each other, and repeatedly
  concealed one another with nets of shafts, both of great might.
'29': >-
  Like the sun and moon at the end of summer covered by swift-moving clouds,
  there was seen neither the taking up, nor the setting, nor the grasping of the
  bow;
'30': >-
  neither the releasing of arrows, nor the drawing back, nor the unstringing;
  neither the fixing of the fist upon the string, nor the taking of aim at the
  target.
'31': >-
  There, because of the swiftness of their hands, and because of the bow-speed
  and the nets of arrows hurled on every side, the very manner of their fighting
  could scarcely be perceived.
'32': >-
  In that sky filled with flying missiles, their forms did not shine forth
  clearly; Lakṣmaṇa met Rāvaṇi, and Rāvaṇi likewise met Lakṣmaṇa.
'33': >-
  A fierce confusion arose from their mutual conflict, as both of them, with
  speed, discharged sharp arrows at one another.
'34': >-
  The sky seemed as though it had become continuous darkness, veiled in gloom,
  by the many sharp hundreds of arrows falling from the two.
'35': >-
  The directions and intermediate quarters were filled with arrows; all was
  covered with darkness, and a great terror prevailed.
'36': >-
  When the thousand-rayed sun had set and darkness had spread, streams of blood,
  like mighty rivers, began to flow by the thousands.
'37': >-
  Flesh-eating creatures, dreadful in cry, flung forth fearsome sounds; at that
  time the wind did not blow, nor did fire blaze.
'38': >-
  “May there be welfare to the worlds,” so did those great sages utter; and
  afflicted Gandharvas, along with Cāraṇas, gathered there.
'39': >-
  Then Saumitri pierced with four arrows the four horses of the
  rākṣasa-lion—black in hue and adorned with golden ornaments.
'40': >-
  Thereupon, with another arrow—a broad-headed shaft, sharp, yellow, drawn to
  its full length, well-feathered and radiant—
'41': >-
  like Indra’s thunderbolt, he struck down the charioteer as he moved about,
  with that arrow-weapon sounding like a clap upon impact.
'42': >-
  By his swiftness, the illustrious Rāghava (Lakṣmaṇa) cut off the head from the
  body; and when the charioteer was slain, the son of Mandodarī,
'43': >-
  took the reins himself, and again grasped his bow. Wondrous indeed was that
  charioteering, seen by all in the midst of battle.
'44': >-
  When he was distracted among the horses, Lakṣmaṇa pierced him with sharp
  arrows; and when he was distracted with the bow, he loosed arrows among the
  horses.
'45': >-
  As he moved fearlessly through the gaps amidst the torrents of arrows,
  Saumitri—most swift in his cutting—pressed him hard in the battle.
'46': >-
  Seeing his charioteer slain in the fight, Rāvaṇa’s son abandoned the
  exultation of battle, and became downcast.
'47': >-
  Beholding that rākṣasa with a dejected face, the leaders of the monkey-troops
  grew exceedingly delighted, and praised Lakṣmaṇa.
'48': >-
  Then Pramāthī, Rabhasa, Śarabha, and Gandhamādana—four monkey-lords, unable to
  endure it—made a swift charge.
'49': >-
  Leaping quickly upon his foremost horses, those four exceedingly heroic
  vānaras, of terrible prowess, fell upon them.
'50': >-
  With those mountain-like vānaras mounted upon them, blood plainly flowed from
  the mouths of the horses.
'51': >-
  Those horses, tormented and broken, lifeless, fell upon the ground. Having
  slain his horses and shattered his great chariot, they sprang up again with
  speed and stood beside Lakṣmaṇa.
'52': >-
  Then Rāvaṇi, having leapt down from the chariot, his horses slain and his
  charioteer overthrown, rushed upon Saumitri with a shower of arrows.
'53': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, comparable to great Indra, tore to pieces with volleys of
  arrows that foot-soldier, who in the battle was sending forth excellent sharp
  shafts, though his splendid horses had been slain.
'54': >-
  Thus ends the ninetieth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Combat of Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) with
  Rāvaṇi (Indrajit).”
