  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  six-hundred-and-sixth sarga, named “Bharata’s Speech.”
'1': >-
  When Rāma, having spoken thus, fell silent after uttering meaningful words,
  then on the bank of the Mandākinī, Bharata—uttering a remarkable, righteous
  address to that righteous one, Rāma, who was ever affectionate toward his
  people—spoke.
'2': >-
  Who, indeed, in this world could be such as you are, O subduer of foes—whom
  sorrow would not afflict, and whom joy would not gladden?
'3': >-
  You are held in esteem by the elders, and you inquire of them about matters
  that admit of doubt.
'4': >-
  He who has attained such understanding—that one regards the dead as though
  living, and the absent as though present—by what cause would he ever be
  tormented?
'5': >-
  One who knows what is higher and what is lower—such are you, O lord among men;
  therefore, even when overtaken by calamity, you do not deserve to sink into
  dejection.
'6': >-
  You are of strength like unto the immortals, a great-souled one, steadfast in
  truth in your pledged undertaking. You are all-knowing, all-seeing, and wise
  as well, O Rāghava.
'7': >-
  One endowed with such qualities as you—one who understands what leads to
  prosperity and what leads to ruin—does not deserve to be brought to the most
  unbearable grief.
'8': >-
  Whatever sin was committed by my mother, through my cause, while I was
  away—may that harm, born of her pettiness, be forgiven for my sake; be
  gracious unto me.
'9': >-
  I am bound by the bond of dharma; therefore I do not strike here my
  mother—though she is deserving of punishment, a doer of sin—with a severe
  chastisement.
'10': >-
  How, being born of Daśaratha—of pure lineage and deeds—could I, knowing
  dharma, commit an unrighteous and loathsome act?
'11': >-
  A guru, performing sacred rites, aged; a king; now departed; my father as
  well—my sire I would not censure in the assembly, regarding him also as a
  deity.
'12': >-
  Who, being a knower of dharma and one versed in dharma, would do such a sinful
  act—bereft of both dharma and artha—merely desiring to please a woman?
'13': >-
  It is an ancient saying, heard of old, that at the final hour beings become
  deluded. By the king acting thus in the world, that saying has been made
  manifest before our very eyes.
'14': >-
  Having aimed at a good end, yet through anger, delusion, and rashness—whatever
  my father transgressed, let that be drawn back and set right by you.
'15': >-
  Because it was the cause of the father’s downfall, that very act is deemed to
  be ‘his offspring’—as it were—by reason of its issue.
'16': >-
  Therefore let it be you who are his true ‘son’; do not let the evil deed of
  your father—an act undertaken, a deed accomplished, condemned by the steadfast
  in this world—come to rest upon you.
'17': >-
  Kaikeyī, and me, and my father, and our friends and kinsmen, and all the
  citizens and people of the realm—save all this, all of it, O you.
'18': >-
  What has the forest to do with kingship? What have matted locks to do with
  kṣatriya duty? What has such tending and guarding to do with it? You ought not
  to perform this shattered, thwarted course of action.
'19': >-
  For this is the foremost dharma of a kṣatriya—consecration (abhiṣeka)—by
  which, O greatly wise one, the protection of the subjects becomes possible.
'20': >-
  Who would, setting aside what is direct and evident, follow a doubtful course,
  lacking clear marks—pursuing a dharma that lies in the future, uncertain, like
  a mere kṣatriya in name, without resolve?
'21': >-
  But if you truly wish to practice a dharma that is born of hardship, then,
  protecting the four varṇas in accordance with dharma, accept hardship.
'22': >-
  Of the four āśramas, householdership is said to be the श्रेष्ठ, the best
  āśrama—so declare those who know dharma and are versed in dharma. How can you
  abandon it?
'23': >-
  In learning, I am but a child; in position, and by birth as well, I am
  inferior to you. How shall I protect the earth while you yet stand present?
'24': >-
  I am deficient in understanding and in virtues, a mere boy, and inferior in
  station too. Separated from you, I am not able to carry on.
'25': >-
  This entire, untroubled ancestral kingdom—free of thorns and obstacles—govern
  it in accordance with your own dharma, O knower of dharma, together with the
  kinsmen.
'26': >-
  Let all the subjects, together with the priests—Vasiṣṭha included—skilled in
  mantras and performing the rites in due form, consecrate you here itself.
'27': >-
  Consecrated by us, go to Ayodhyā for the protection of the realm; swiftly
  conquering the worlds, like Vāsava (Indra) with the Maruts.
'28': >-
  Discharging the three debts, thoroughly burning away ill-wishers, and
  gratifying friends with desired boons—do you alone rule here, and direct me.
'29': >-
  Let your friends be glad today at your consecration, O noble one; let your
  ill-wishers, fearful, flee today to the ten directions.
'30': >-
  Wiping away the reproach that falls upon my mother, O bull among men—today
  protect there the venerable departed father from sin.
'31': >-
  With bowed head I entreat you—show compassion to me, and to all our kinsmen,
  as Maheśvara shows compassion to beings.
'32': >-
  And if, setting all this behind you, you will go from here to the forest
  alone, then I too shall go—together with you.
'33': >-
  Thus did Bharata, bowed with anguish, seek to win over the lord of the earth;
  yet Rāma, possessed of steadfastness, did not form the resolve to depart (for
  Ayodhyā), being firmly established in his father’s word.
'34': >-
  Beholding that wondrous firmness in Rāghava, the people—though sorrowful—felt
  equal joy; sorrowing that he would not go to Ayodhyā, yet rejoicing as they
  beheld his steadfastness to his vow.
'35': >-
  Then the priests, the leaders of the guilds and townsmen, and the
  mothers—fainting, with tears upon their cheeks—praised Bharata as he spoke
  thus; and, bowing to Rāma, they too implored him together.
'36': >-
  Thus ends the six-hundred-and-sixth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the Ādikāvya, named “Bharata’s Speech.”
