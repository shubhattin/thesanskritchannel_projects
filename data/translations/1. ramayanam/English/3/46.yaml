  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the forty-sixth canto,
  named “The honoring of the mendicant Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Thus harshly addressed, the younger brother of Rāghava (Lakṣmaṇa) became
  enraged; and, intent with great eagerness on finding Rāma, he set forth, and
  in no long time departed.
'2': >-
  Then Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa), drawing near, quickly took the opportunity that had
  arisen, and—having assumed the guise of a wandering mendicant—advanced toward
  Vaidehī.
'3': >-
  Clad in smooth saffron-colored garments, with matted hair, bearing an umbrella
  and wearing sandals, and having slung over his left shoulder, in auspicious
  fashion, a staff and a water-pot,
'4': >-
  In the form of an ascetic mendicant he followed after Vaidehī; exceedingly
  powerful, he came upon her in the forest when she was bereft of her two
  brothers-in-law (Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa).
'5': >-
  He beheld that youthful, illustrious princess—left alone—like the twilight
  bereft of sun and moon by a mighty one.
'6': >-
  Fierce as a baleful ग्रह (planetary influence), like Rohiṇī without the moon,
  that dreadful, wicked-doing one—when the trees of Janasthāna saw him,
'7': >-
  They did not tremble; and the wind did not blow. And the swift-flowing river
  Godāvarī, seeing him with blood-red eyes as he gazed,
'8': >-
  Became still and began to flow no further out of fear. Desiring to seize the
  interval when Rāma was absent, Daśagrīva in that very moment
'9': >-
  Approached Vaidehī in the form of a mendicant. Unworthy at heart though
  wearing a worthy appearance, he came near her as she was grieving for her
  lord.
'10': >-
  He moved toward Vaidehī like Saturn (Śanaiścara) approaching a bright
  constellation—suddenly appearing in an imposing guise, like a well covered
  over with grass.
'11': >-
  Having looked upon Vaidehī, the illustrious wife of Rāma, Rāvaṇa stood there;
  and standing thus, he then fixed his gaze upon Rāma’s wife.
'12': >-
  She was auspicious, with charming teeth and lips, her face like the full moon,
  seated in the leaf-thatched hut, afflicted by sorrow and tears.
'13': >-
  That night-ranger, his heart delighted, went up to Vaidehī—she of lotus-leaf
  eyes, wearing yellow silk.
'14': >-
  Seeing her, pierced by the arrow of desire, and uttering the sacred
  Brahmanical salutation, the lord of rākṣasas spoke courteous words in that
  lonely place:
'15': >-
  Rāvaṇa praised her—she, the foremost glory of the three worlds, like Fortune
  (Śrī) herself without a lotus—radiant in her bodily splendor.
'16': >-
  “O you whose hue is like silver and gold, O you clad in yellow silk—like a
  lotus-pond (padminī) bearing a lovely garland of lotuses,”
'17': >-
  “Are you Modesty (Hrī), Prosperity (Śrī), Fame (Kīrti), auspicious Lakṣmī, or
  some apsaras, O fair-faced one? Or are you Abundance (Bhūti), O slender-limbed
  one, or Rati herself, roaming at will?”
'18': >-
  “Even and well-formed, glossy, and white are your teeth; wide and spotless are
  your eyes, red at the corners, with dark pupils.”
'19': >-
  “Broad is your hip and full; your thighs are like an elephant’s trunk—thus
  well-grown, rounded, compact, and confidently firm.”
'20': >-
  “High and full, lovely, like smooth tāla-fruits—your breasts are charming,
  adorned with excellent jewels.”
'21': >-
  “O you of lovely smile, lovely teeth, lovely eyes, and graceful bearing—you
  steal my heart, just as water steals away the bank of a river.”
'22': >-
  “Your waist is measured as if within one’s hand; your hair is beautiful; your
  breasts are close-set. Truly, neither goddess, nor gandharvī, nor yakṣī, nor
  kiṃnarī—”
'23': >-
  “—has any woman of such a form ever been seen by me upon the earth. Supreme is
  your beauty among worlds, and so too your delicacy and your youth.”
'24': >-
  “And your dwelling here in the forest torments my mind. Therefore, turn
  back—blessing be upon you; you are not fit to dwell here.”
'25': >-
  “This is the habitation of dreadful rākṣasas who can assume forms at will. For
  you there are charming palace-tops and city-groves,”
'26': >-
  “Prosperous and fragrant, suitable to be enjoyed by you: the finest garlands,
  the finest perfumes, and excellent garments, O fair one.”
'27': >-
  “And I deem a noble husband fitting for you, O dark-eyed one. Who are
  you—among the Rudras, or the Maruts, O you of pure smile?”
'28': >-
  “Or among the Vasus, O slender-limbed one? To me you appear like a goddess.
  Here do not come gandharvas, nor gods, nor kiṃnaras.”
'29': >-
  “This is the dwelling-place of rākṣasas—how then have you come here? Here are
  monkeys of the branches, lions, leopards, tigers, deer, and wolves;”
'30': >-
  “Bears and hyenas and herons—how do you not fear them? And (how do you not
  fear) mighty, dreadful elephants, intoxicated with rut?”
'31': >-
  “How do you, alone in this great wilderness, not tremble, O fair-faced one?
  Who are you, whose are you, and from where have you come, and for what reason
  (have you come) to the Daṇḍakas,”
'32': >-
  “That you wander alone, O auspicious lady, through these dreadful regions
  frequented by rākṣasas?” Thus was Vaidehī praised by Rāvaṇa, that great-souled
  one.
'33': >-
  Seeing him arrive in the guise of a twice-born (brāhmaṇa), Maithilī honored
  Rāvaṇa with every form of hospitality due to a guest.
'34': >-
  First bringing a seat and inviting him with water for washing the feet, she
  then said to him—who appeared gentle to behold—“It is prepared,” indeed.
'35': >-
  Beholding the one who had come in the attire of a twice-born, bearing the
  mendicant’s bowl and the saffron-dyed cloth, Maithilī—since he was not to be
  hated, appearing as one to be welcomed by proper means—invited him as one
  would a brāhmaṇa who had thus arrived.
'36': >-
  “Here is a seat, O brāhmaṇa; be pleased to sit upon it. And accept this water
  for the feet. And here is excellent fare gathered from the forest—without
  distraction, partake of it here, prepared for your sake.”
'37': >-
  Though being invited by her, whose words were complete and courteous, and
  having observed Maithilī, the wife of the lord of men—Rāvaṇa, forcing his mind
  into firm resolve for her abduction, committed himself to her destruction.
'38': >-
  Then, awaiting her well-adorned husband who had gone to hunt, together with
  Lakṣmaṇa, she looked about; and looking out, she saw that vast green
  forest—but not Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.
'39': >-
  Thus ends the forty-sixth canto, named “The honoring of the mendicant Rāvaṇa,”
  in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the revered ancient epic.
