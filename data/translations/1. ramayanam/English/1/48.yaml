  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, begins the forty-eighth
  sarga, named “The Curse upon Śakra (Indra) and Ahalyā.”
'1': >-
  Then, after inquiring of one another’s welfare there at that meeting, when the
  conversation had come to an end, Sumati spoke these words to the great sage.
'2': >-
  “These two princes—blessing be upon you—are of godlike prowess: heroic, moving
  with the gait of an elephant and a lion, comparable to a tiger and a bull.”
'3': >-
  “Their eyes are broad like lotus-petals; they bear sword, quiver, and bow; and
  in beauty they resemble the Aśvin twins, standing upon the threshold of
  youth.”
'4': >-
  “As if by mere chance they have reached the earth, like immortals come down
  from heaven. How have they come here on foot, and for what purpose, and for
  whom, O sage?”
'5': >-
  “They adorn this region like the moon and the sun adorning the sky; and they
  are alike to one another in stature, in expression, and in movement and
  conduct.”
'6': >-
  “For what reason have these foremost of men arrived upon a difficult path,
  those heroes bearing excellent weapons? I wish to hear the truth in full.”
'7': >-
  Hearing those words of his, Viśvāmitra related the events just as they had
  occurred—how they had dwelt at Siddhāśrama, and in what manner the rākṣasas
  were slain. Upon hearing Viśvāmitra’s account, the king was filled with the
  highest astonishment.
'8': >-
  Those two, the mighty sons of Daśaratha, had come as most honored guests; and
  he worshipped them duly, with the proper rites, for they were worthy of
  reverent hospitality.
'9': >-
  Then, having received supreme hospitality from Sumati, the two Rāghavas stayed
  there for one night, and thereafter went on to Mithilā.
'10': >-
  Beholding that auspicious city of Janaka, all the sages praised it, saying,
  “Well done, well done!” and they honored Mithilā with their acclaim.
'11': >-
  There, in a grove near Mithilā, Rāghava saw an āśrama—ancient, solitary, and
  delightful—and he questioned the foremost of sages about it.
'12': >-
  “This appears like an āśrama; why is it deserted of sages? I wish to hear, O
  Blessed One: whose former hermitage is this?”
'13': >-
  Hearing the words spoken by Rāghava, that great-souled Viśvāmitra, skilled in
  speech, replied.
'14': >-
  “Indeed, I shall tell you—listen truly, O Rāghava—whose hermitage-site this
  is, which was cursed in wrath by a great self-controlled sage.”
'15': >-
  “Formerly, O foremost of men, this was the āśrama of the great-souled
  Gautama—radiant as something divine, and highly honored even by the gods.”
'16': >-
  “Here, in olden days, that illustrious sage practiced austerities together
  with Ahalyā, for many thousands of years, O prince.”
'17': >-
  “Knowing his absence, Sahasrākṣa (Indra), the lord of Śacī, took on the guise
  of a sage and spoke these words to Ahalyā.”
'18': >-
  “Those who desire union do not wait for the season, O gentle-waisted one, when
  they are firmly resolved. I desire union with you.”
'19': >-
  “Recognizing Sahasrākṣa though he wore a sage’s guise, O delight of the Raghu
  line, that woman of feeble understanding formed an intent, out of curiosity
  for the king of gods.”
'20': >-
  Then she said to the best of the gods, her inner self deeming itself
  satisfied: “I am fulfilled, O foremost of gods; go quickly from here, O lord.”
'21': >-
  “O lord of the gods, protect me and yourself in every way from Gautama.” But
  Indra, laughing, spoke these words to Ahalyā:
'22': >-
  “O fair-hipped one, I am pleased; I shall go as I came.” Thus, having met with
  her, he then went forth from that leaf-hut.
'23': >-
  In great agitation, hurrying, O Rāma, and fearful with regard to Gautama, he
  then beheld Gautama—the great sage—entering.
'24': >-
  Unassailable by gods and demons, endowed with the power of austerity, his body
  wet with the water of a sacred ford, blazing like fire.
'25': >-
  Seeing that bull among sages holding fuel-sticks and kuśa-grass in his hand,
  the lord of the gods was terrified and became downcast of face.
'26': >-
  Then the sage, seeing Sahasrākṣa wearing a sage’s guise, though himself of
  righteous conduct, spoke in anger to that evil-doer.
'27': >-
  “O fool! Assuming my form, you have done this deed that ought not to be done;
  therefore you shall become impotent—your attempt shall be fruitless.”
'28': >-
  Thus spoken to by Gautama, that great self-controlled one, in his divine
  wrath, caused the testicles of Sahasrākṣa to fall to the ground at that very
  moment.
'29': >-
  And having thus cursed Śakra, he also cursed his wife: “Here you shall dwell
  for many thousands of years.”
'30': >-
  “Living on air alone, without food, practicing austerity, lying upon
  ashes—unseen by all beings—you shall dwell in this hermitage.”
'31': >-
  “But when Rāma, the mighty son of Daśaratha, irresistible, shall come into
  this dreadful forest, then you shall be purified.”
'32': >-
  “By offering him hospitality, O woman of evil conduct, freed from greed and
  delusion, you shall, with joy, regain and bear again your own proper form in
  my presence.”
'33': >-
  Having thus spoken, the glorious Gautama, leaving behind that woman of wicked
  conduct and abandoning this hermitage—frequented by Siddhas and
  Cāraṇas—practiced austerities upon the delightful peak of the Himālaya, that
  great ascetic.
'34': >-
  Thus ends the forty-eighth sarga of the Bāla-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Curse upon Śakra and Ahalyā.”
