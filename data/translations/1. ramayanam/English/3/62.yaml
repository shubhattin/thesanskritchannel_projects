  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-second chapter, called “Rāghava’s Lament.”
'1': >-
  Not beholding Sītā, that righteous-souled Rāma—his mind smitten by
  grief—lamented aloud, O mighty-armed one, lotus-eyed.
'2': >-
  As though seeing Sītā and yet not seeing her, tormented by the god of love,
  Rāghava spoke words that were hard to utter, resorting only to lamentation.
'3': >-
  “O beloved, ever dear to flowers, with branches of the aśoka tree you cover
  your body—alas, you who increase my sorrow!”
'4': >-
  “O goddess, I see your two thighs, like the plantain-stem, both covered with
  plantain leaves; you are not able to conceal them.”
'5': >-
  “O auspicious lady, O goddess, smiling, you frequent the grove of karṇikāra
  trees. Enough of this jesting, which indeed brings me torment.”
'6': >-
  “Especially in this hermitage-dwelling, such laughter is not commendable. I
  understand your nature, O beloved—fond of playful teasing.”
'7': >-
  “Come, O large-eyed one; this hut of yours stands empty. It is plain: Sītā has
  either been devoured by rākṣasas or else carried away.”
'8': >-
  “Indeed, she does not come near me as I lament, O Lakṣmaṇa. These herds of
  deer, O Lakṣmaṇa, have eyes filled with tears,”
'9': >-
  “as though they were announcing to me that my lady has been eaten by the
  night-rangers. Alas, my noble lady—where have you gone? Alas, O chaste one of
  exquisite complexion!”
'10': >-
  “Alas, today what will become of me before Kaikeyī, who has at last attained
  her desire? I went forth together with Sītā, and I have returned without
  Sītā.”
'11': >-
  “How indeed shall I enter my empty inner apartments? The people will say of
  me, ‘He is without manly strength,’ and also, ‘He is pitiless.’”
'12': >-
  “For my cowardice has been plainly revealed by Sītā’s abduction; and when my
  forest-dwelling is ended, I must face Janaka, lord of Mithilā.”
'13': >-
  “When the king of Videha asks after our welfare, how shall I be able even to
  look at him? Surely, seeing me bereft of her,”
'14': >-
  “burnt with the anguish of losing his daughter, he will fall under the sway of
  delusion. Or else I shall not go to the city that is governed by Bharata.”
'15': >-
  “Even heaven itself, devoid of her, is held by me to be only emptiness.
  Therefore, leaving me here in the forest, go to the auspicious city of
  Ayodhyā.”
'16': >-
  “For without Sītā I could not live in any way at all. Bharata, firmly
  embracing you, should be addressed by you in my words:”
'17': >-
  “‘You have been authorized by Rāma: rule and protect the earth. And my mother
  Kaikeyī, and Sumitrā too, O mighty one,”
'18': >-
  “and Kauśalyā also, in accordance with what is right, should be saluted by you
  on my command, and should be guarded with effort by you who walk in good
  conduct.’”
'19': >-
  “And this ruin of Sītā—and of me as well, O slayer of foes—should be conveyed
  by you, at length, to my mother.”
'20': >-
  Thus, while Rāghava lamented in misery, having entered the forest without that
  fair-haired lady, even Lakṣmaṇa—his face shaken with fear, his mind
  distressed—became exceedingly afflicted and anguished.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-second chapter in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “Rāghava’s Lament.”
