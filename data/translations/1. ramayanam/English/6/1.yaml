  Now begins the first chapter, named “The Praise of Hanumān,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Having heard Hanumān’s words, spoken duly and in proper manner, Rāma—filled
  with joy and affection—spoke in reply.
'2': >-
  The work accomplished by Hanumān is exceedingly great and rare upon the
  earth—such as cannot be achieved by any other even in thought upon this
  terrestrial world.
'3': >-
  For I do not see anyone who could cross the vast ocean—save Garuḍa and Vāyu
  alone, and save Hanumān as well.
'4': >-
  The city of Laṅkā—unassailable to gods, dānavas, yakṣas, gandharvas, nāgas,
  and rākṣasas—was protected by Rāvaṇa.
'5': >-
  Having entered it, relying on sheer courage and strength, who indeed could
  come out alive? Who could enter that most difficult-to-assail city, guarded
  all around by the rākṣasas?
'6': >-
  He who is endowed with prowess and strength has none equal to Hanumān. Hanumān
  has accomplished a mighty service on behalf of Sugrīva, acting in a manner
  fitting to his own power and to his valour.
'7': >-
  That servant who, being appointed by his lord to a difficult task, performs it
  with devotion and heartfelt attachment—him they call the best among men.
'8': >-
  But he who, though appointed, does not accomplish the great task to the
  satisfaction of the king—though he is a servant, capable and competent—him
  they call a middling man.
'9': >-
  And he who, being appointed to the king’s work, does not accomplish it, even
  though he is a servant, capable and competent—him they call the lowest of men.
'10': >-
  But Hanumān, once appointed to this commission, has accomplished what had to
  be done; and neither was his own worth diminished, and Sugrīva too has been
  well pleased.
'11': >-
  And I—of Raghu’s line—and mighty-armed Lakṣmaṇa as well, have today been
  upheld and preserved in righteousness by the sight (and tidings) of Vaidehī.
'12': >-
  Yet this mind of mine, afflicted as I am, presses upon me again and again with
  this thought—that I do not render a fitting and worthy favour in return to him
  who has brought me tidings of what is dear.
'13': >-
  This embrace is, as it were, my all-in-all offered to Hanumān; having obtained
  this occasion, I have bestowed it upon that great-souled one.
'14': >-
  So saying, Rāma—his whole frame thrilled with joy and love—embraced Hanumān,
  the self-possessed one, who had returned after accomplishing the task.
'15': >-
  Then, reflecting again, the best of the Raghus spoke these words, while
  Sugrīva also—the lord of the Vānara hosts—stood listening.
'16': >-
  In every way, the search for Sītā has indeed been well accomplished; but upon
  reaching the ocean, my mind has again fallen into distress.
'17': >-
  How indeed shall the Vānaras, assembled together, reach the southern shore of
  this ocean—so hard to cross, whose waters are vast?
'18': >-
  Although this account concerning Vaidehī has been told to me, what answer is
  there regarding the Vānara hosts crossing the ocean?
'19': >-
  Having thus spoken, Rāma—the subduer of enemies—agitated by grief, the
  mighty-armed one then fell into deep contemplation, turning his mind upon
  Hanumān.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the first chapter, named “The Praise of Hanumān,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the sacred, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
