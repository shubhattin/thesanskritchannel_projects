  Then, in the blessed Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-seventh chapter, called “Āditya-hṛdayam.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, Rāma—wearied by the battle—stood on the battlefield, absorbed in
  anxious thought, and seeing Rāvaṇa stationed in front of him, ready again for
  combat.
'2': >-
  Then the gods, assembling together to behold the warfare, approached the
  field; and drawing near, the holy Agastya spoke to Rāma.
'3': >-
  “Rāma, Rāma, mighty-armed one—listen to this secret, eternal (hymn), by which,
  dear child, you shall conquer all your enemies in battle.”
'4': >-
  “(This is) the sacred Āditya-hṛdayam, the destroyer of all foes, the bringer
  of victory—(a hymn) to be recited ever; imperishable, supreme, and
  auspicious.”
'5': >-
  “Most auspicious among all that is auspicious; the destroyer of all sin; the
  pacifier of anxiety and grief; the excellent increaser of life and longevity.”
'6': >-
  “Worship Vivasvān—the radiant, rising Sun—endowed with rays, adored by devas
  and asuras alike: Bhāskara, the Lord of the worlds.”
'7': >-
  “For he is indeed the very Self of all the gods—splendid, the source of the
  rays; and with his beams he protects the hosts of gods and asuras and all the
  worlds.”
'8': >-
  “He is Brahmā, and Viṣṇu, and Śiva, and Skanda, and Prajāpati; he is Mahendra,
  and the Lord of wealth (Kubera), and Time (Kāla), and Yama; he is Soma, and
  the Lord of waters.”
'9': >-
  “He is the Pitṛs, the Vasus, the Sādhyas, and the two Aśvins, the Maruts, and
  Manu; he is Vāyu and Agni; he is progeny and the very life-breath; he is the
  maker of seasons—Prabhākara, the Light-maker.”
'10': >-
  “He is Āditya, Savitṛ, Sūrya; the Bird (that courses through the sky); Pūṣan;
  the possessor of beams; golden in semblance is Bhānu; he of golden seed, the
  day-maker (Divākara).”
'11': >-
  “He whose steeds are bay; he of a thousand rays; he who is drawn by the
  seven-seven horses; he who is full of radiance; the churner-away of darkness;
  Śambhu; Tvaṣṭṛ; Mārtaṇḍa; the storehouse of rays.”
'12': >-
  “Hiraṇyagarbha; Śiśira; Tapana; Ahaḥkara; Ravi; he who bears fire within; the
  son of Aditi; Śaṅkha; the destroyer of cold.”
'13': >-
  “Lord of the sky; the cleaver of darkness; the knower of Ṛk, Yajus, and Sāman;
  the pourer of dense rain; the friend of waters; the traveller along the paths
  of the Vindhya ranges.”
'14': >-
  “Ātāpī; the orb-bearer; Mṛtyu; Piṅgala; the heater of all; the Sage-poet; the
  All; of great splendor; ruddy-hued; the source from which all beings arise.”
'15': >-
  “The lord of constellations, planets, and stars; the sustainer of the
  universe; more radiant even than all radiances—O you of twelvefold nature,
  salutations be to you!”
'16': >-
  “Salutations to you who abide in the eastern mountain; salutations to you upon
  the western mountain; salutations to the Lord of hosts of lights; salutations
  to the Lord of the day.”
'17': >-
  “Salutations again and again to him who is Victory, and to him who is the
  Auspiciousness of victory; salutations again and again to Hari-aśva;
  salutations again and again to the thousand-rayed one—to Āditya, salutations
  again and again!”
'18': >-
  “Salutations again and again to the fierce one, the heroic one, the deer (that
  moves swiftly); salutations to the awakener of the lotus; salutations be to
  you, O mighty and impetuous one!”
'19': >-
  “To the lord who is Brahmā and Īśāna and Acyuta; to the valorous one whose
  splendor is Āditya’s; to the shining one, the devourer of all; to the
  Rudra-like form—salutation!”
'20': >-
  “Salutations to the destroyer of darkness, the destroyer of frost, the slayer
  of foes; to the immeasurable-souled one; to the slayer of the ungrateful; to
  the god, the lord of luminaries—salutations!”
'21': >-
  “To him whose luster is like heated gold; to Hari; to the maker of all
  (Viśvakarman); salutations to him who utterly strikes down darkness; to the
  radiant one; to the witness of the worlds—salutations!”
'22': >-
  “Truly, this Lord destroys beings, and again brings them forth; he protects,
  he burns, and he causes rain—by his rays.”
'23': >-
  “He keeps wakeful among those that sleep; he is firmly established in all
  beings; he is also the Agnihotra sacrifice, and he is indeed the fruit of
  those who perform Agnihotra.”
'24': >-
  “He is the gods and the sacrifices (kratus) as well; and he is the very fruit
  of sacrifices; whatever rites and acts are performed in all the worlds—(all
  are) of that supreme Lord.”
'25': >-
  “Remembering and praising him in calamities, in hardships, in wildernesses,
  and in fears—any man at all does not sink into ruin, O Rāghava.”
'26': >-
  “Worship him with undivided mind—him, the God of gods, the Lord of the
  universe. Reciting this thrice (three times), one shall attain victory in
  battles.”
'27': >-
  “This very moment, mighty-armed one, you shall slay Rāvaṇa.” Having spoken
  thus, Agastya then departed, going as he had come.
'28': >-
  Hearing this, that great and splendid Rāma then became free from sorrow; and,
  pleased in heart and disciplined in self, he held (the hymn) fast (within his
  mind).
'29': >-
  Gazing upon Āditya (the Sun) and reciting this, he attained supreme joy; then,
  having sipped water thrice and become pure, that valiant one took up his bow.
'30': >-
  Beholding Rāvaṇa, delighted at heart, he advanced seeking victory; with great
  and total effort he became wholly intent upon slaying him.
'31': >-
  Then Ravi (the Sun), observing Rāma—his mind glad, exceedingly rejoicing—and
  knowing that the lord of the night-rangers (Rāvaṇa) was nearing destruction,
  hastened to utter words while standing in the midst of the hosts of gods.
'32': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-seventh chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the
  venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “Āditya-hṛdayam.”
