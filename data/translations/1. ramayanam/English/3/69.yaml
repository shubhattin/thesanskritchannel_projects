  Now begins the sixty-ninth canto, named “The Seizure by Kabandha,” in the
  Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Having thus offered water to him, the two Rāghavas then set forth, keeping
  their gaze upon the forest in search of Sītā, and proceeded toward the western
  quarter.
'2': >-
  Going toward that southern direction, those two—bearing arrows, bow, and
  sword—unwearied scions of Ikṣvāku, took to the path.
'3': >-
  It was intertwined with many thickets and trees, and with creepers; hemmed in
  on every side, difficult of access, dense, and terrible to behold.
'4': >-
  Pressing on swiftly and keeping to the southern quarter, those two mighty men
  traversed that exceedingly dreadful great wilderness.
'5': >-
  Then, after going three krośas beyond Jana-sthāna, the two highly energetic
  Rāghavas entered the dense Kroñcāraṇya.
'6': >-
  It appeared like a mass of many clouds, and as though exultant on every side;
  it was filled with auspicious flowers of many hues, and thronged with herds of
  beasts and flocks of birds.
'7': >-
  Desiring to behold Vaidehī, the two searched that forest; here and there they
  halted, afflicted with grief at Sītā’s abduction.
'8': >-
  Then the two brothers went three krośas eastward; having passed beyond
  Kroñcāraṇya, they came into the vicinity of the hermitage of Mataṅga.
'9': >-
  Beholding that terrible forest, filled with many dreadful beasts and birds,
  crowded with many kinds of trees—everywhere thick with dense growth—
'10': >-
  the two sons of Daśaratha saw there, on a mountain, a cavern—deep as the
  netherworld and perpetually enveloped in darkness.
'11': >-
  And as the tiger-like men drew near, not far from that cavern they beheld a
  rākṣasī of enormous form, with a misshapen face.
'12': >-
  She inspired fear in the faint-hearted—hideous, of fierce
  appearance—pot-bellied, with sharp fangs, grim, and rough-skinned.
'13': >-
  Devouring dreadful deer, monstrous in form, with loosened, disheveled
  hair—there the two brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa looked upon her.
'14': >-
  Approaching those heroes as they went with the elder brother in front, she
  said, “Come, let us sport,” and seized hold of Lakṣmaṇa.
'15': >-
  And embracing the son of Sumitrā, she spoke these words to him: “I am named
  Ayomukhī; you are my gain—you are dear to me.”
'16': >-
  “O lord, in mountain fastnesses and on the sandbanks of rivers, you shall live
  long, O hero; you shall sport with me.”
'17': >-
  Thus addressed, Lakṣmaṇa, enraged, drew his sword, and that destroyer of foes
  cut off her ears, nose, and breasts.
'18': >-
  When her ears and nose were cut away, she screamed in a discordant voice; and
  the rākṣasī, terrible to behold, fled away as she had come.
'19': >-
  When she had gone, those two—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, slayers of enemies—went on
  with vigor into the dense forest and advanced further.
'20': >-
  But great-splendored Lakṣmaṇa—courageous, virtuous, and pure—spoke with joined
  palms to his brother of blazing radiance:
'21': >-
  “My strong arm throbs, and my mind too is as though agitated. Again and again
  I notice ominous portents.”
'22': >-
  “Therefore, O noble one, be on your guard and do as I say; for my omens at
  once proclaim impending alarm.”
'23': >-
  “This bird named Vañjulaka, exceedingly dreadful, cries out as though
  foretelling our victory in battle.”
'24': >-
  As they thus searched that entire forest with vigor, a vast sound arose, as
  though a gale were rending that woodland.
'25': >-
  As if tightly enwrapped within the thicket by the wind-god’s force, the sound
  of that forest spread, as though filling the whole wood.
'26': >-
  Desiring to learn the source of that sound, Rāma—sword in hand, with his
  younger brother—beheld a rākṣasa of exceedingly huge body and broad chest.
'27': >-
  And the two drew near; before them stood that rākṣasa—grown immense, without
  head or neck—Kabandha, whose mouth was in his belly.
'28': >-
  Raised high like a great mountain, bristling with sharp, pointed hairs; dark
  like a blue cloud, fierce, and with a voice like the rumbling of
  thunderclouds.
'29': >-
  With a blazing radiance from the brow like the flame of fire; and with a great
  tawny wing, broad and long—
'30': >-
  and with one dreadful eye in his chest, yet fair to look upon; endowed with
  huge fangs, licking his great mouth—
'31': >-
  devouring bears, lions, deer, and birds of terrible aspect; and brandishing
  two fearsome arms, each a yojana in length.
'32': >-
  With his hands he seized various bears, flocks of birds, and deer, dragging
  some toward him and hurling others away—many leaders of herds of beasts.
'33': >-
  Standing and blocking the path of the two brothers who had come there,
  then—after passing him by—at a distance of but one krośa they perceived him
  (looming still).
'34': >-
  A vast, dreadful, fearsome Kabandha, hemmed in by his own arms—so ghastly in
  form, like a trunk without limbs, and most terrible to behold.
'35': >-
  That mighty-armed one, stretching out his broad arms exceedingly, seized both
  the Rāghavas together, crushing them with force.
'36': >-
  Both were sword-bearers, firm of bow, keen in splendor, mighty-armed; yet the
  two brothers were brought into helplessness, dragged along by that great
  strength.
'37': >-
  There, by steadfastness and valor, the heroic Rāghava did not falter; but
  Lakṣmaṇa, through youth and lack of reliance (on experience), was greatly
  shaken.
'38': >-
  And despondent, the younger brother of Rāghava said to Rāma: “See me, O hero,
  helpless and brought under the power of the rākṣasa.”
'39': >-
  “Be released, Rāghava, by letting him take me alone. Offering me as an
  oblation to this being, flee away as you please.”
'40': >-
  “In a short time, in my judgment, you will find Vaidehī; and, O Kakutstha, you
  will regain the ancestral kingdom and the earth.”
'41': >-
  “Then, established in kingship, O Rāma, you ought to remember me always.” When
  Lakṣmaṇa had thus spoken, Rāma replied to Saumitrī:
'42': >-
  “Do not, O hero, be needlessly afraid; one like you does not sink into
  despair.” Meanwhile the cruel one—while the two brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
  were thus held—
'43': >-
  Kabandha, the mighty-armed, foremost among Dānavas, spoke to them: “Who are
  you two, bull-shouldered men, bearing great swords and bows?”
'44': >-
  “By fate have you come into this dreadful region and into my sight. Tell me
  what business you have here, and for what purpose you have come.”
'45': >-
  “You have come into this place while I, tormented by hunger, stand here—both
  of you with bow, arrows, and sword, like two bulls with sharp horns.”
'46': >-
  “You have swiftly come within my reach; for indeed your life is hard to obtain
  (hard to preserve)!” Hearing those words of Kabandha, the evil-souled one, 
'47': >-
  Rāma said to Lakṣmaṇa—his mouth drying up—“O you of dreadful yet true valor,
  having fallen from hardship into still greater hardship, 
'48': >-
  this calamity that leads to life’s end has come upon us before we have
  regained that beloved one. Great, O Lakṣmaṇa, is the might of Time over all
  beings.”
'49': >-
  “See, O tiger among men, you and I are bewildered by misfortunes. There is no
  burden (no restraint) upon destiny with regard to all beings, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'50': >-
  “Heroes, strong men, and those trained in weapons on the field of battle—when
  overtaken by Time—collapse like embankments of sand.”
'51': >-
  Thus speaking, Daśarathi—of firm, truthful valor, of great renown and mighty
  prowess—glanced at Saumitrī of lofty courage, and then, by his own self, made
  his resolve steadfast.
'52': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-ninth canto, named “The Seizure by Kabandha,” in the
  Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
