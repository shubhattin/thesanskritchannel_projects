'0': >-
  Now begins the fifty-ninth canto (sarga), named “The Anointing (Consecration)
  of Ravana,” in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  When that protector of the rākṣasa host had been slain in battle by the bull
  among the monkeys, the army of the rākṣasa-king—armed with dreadful weapons
  and swift as the surge of the ocean—fled in disorder.
'2': >-
  Having gone to the lord of the rākṣasas, they reported that the commander
  (Prahasta), the son of Pāvaka, had been destroyed; and hearing those words of
  theirs, the rākṣasa-lord was seized by wrath.
'3': >-
  Hearing that Prahasta had been slain in the conflict, tormented by anger and
  with his mind overwhelmed by grief, he spoke to those leaders of the rākṣasa
  bands as Indra might speak to the chiefs of the celestial hosts.
'4': >-
  “No contempt is to be shown toward the enemy by those through whom the power
  of Indra is brought low; my commander of the army has been slain—together with
  his followers and his elephants.
'5': >-
  “Therefore, intent on the destruction of the foe and on victory, I myself,
  without hesitation, shall go to the very forefront of that wondrous battle.
'6': >-
  “Today, with torrents of arrows I shall burn that monkey host, and Rāma with
  Lakṣmaṇa—like a forest set ablaze with blazing fires. Today I shall satiate
  the earth with the blood of apes!”
'7': >-
  Having spoken thus, the enemy of the lord of the gods mounted his
  chariot—shining like fire, yoked with the best of horses—radiant with beauty
  and blazing in splendor.
'8': >-
  Amid the blare of conches, kettledrums, and panavas, with claps, shouts, and
  lion-roars resounding, and being duly honored with auspicious hymns, the
  foremost of rākṣasa kings then set forth.
'9': >-
  Surrounded by flesh-eating rākṣasas, whose forms were like mountains and
  clouds and whose eyes blazed like fire, the chief of rākṣasa kings shone—like
  Rudra, lord of the immortals, surrounded by spirits.
'10': >-
  Then the mighty one, suddenly issuing forth from the city, beheld that fierce
  army of monkeys, risen like the thunder of the great ocean-cloud, with trees
  and rocks held aloft in their hands.
'11': >-
  Seeing that exceedingly dreadful rākṣasa host, Rāma—whose arms were like
  lordly serpents—followed by his army, spoke to Vibhīṣaṇa, the foremost among
  weapon-bearers, possessed of great glory.
'12': >-
  “This army, adorned with many flags, banners, and white parasols, and
  furnished with lances, swords, spears, and tridents—whose is it, unshakable
  and fearless, like a great Indra, attended by elephant-like warriors?”
'13': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, Vibhīṣaṇa—whose valor was like Śakra’s—declared to Rāma,
  foremost of the mighty, the names of those great-souled leaders among the
  rākṣasas.
'14': >-
  “He who rides upon an elephant’s back, that great-souled one, with copper-red
  face like the newly risen sun, shaking the elephant’s head as he
  approaches—know him, O king, to be Akampana.
'15': >-
  “He who stands on a chariot with the banner of a lion, brandishing a bow that
  shines like Indra’s rainbow—fierce, with bared dreadful fangs like a rutting
  elephant—he is named Indrajit, the bestower of boons.
'16': >-
  “And he who is like the Vindhya or a great mountain—an archer upon a chariot,
  an over-mighty atiratha, of immense body—stretching his incomparable bow: he
  is called Atikāya.
'17': >-
  “He with copper-red eyes like the newly risen sun, mounted upon a donkey that
  clangs with the sound of bells, roaring fiercely—he is the great-souled
  warrior Mahodara.
'18': >-
  “He who mounts a horse with golden, variegated trappings, shining like
  twilight-clouds and mountain peaks, raising a spear wreathed in rays—he is a
  piśāca, swift as a thunderbolt.
'19': >-
  “And he who, grasping a sharp trident blazing like lightning, with the speed
  of a servant’s thunderbolt, mounted on a lordly bull shining like the moon—he
  is the renowned Triśira.”
'20': >-
  “And that one whose form is like a cloud—Kumbha—broad, well-built, with a
  noble chest, resolute, bearing the banner of the serpent-king, going forth
  while stretching and shaking his bow.
'21': >-
  “And he who comes bearing a blazing, smoke-wreathed mace, studded with gold
  like thunderbolts—Nikumbha, whose deeds are dreadful and marvelous, the very
  banner of the rākṣasa host.
'22': >-
  “And he who, mounted upon a chariot furnished with bow, sword, and showers of
  arrows, bearing a banner, and shining like fire—he is the fierce Narāntaka,
  who fights among mountain-peaks.
'23': >-
  “And he who shines surrounded by spirits of many dreadful forms—faces of
  tiger, camel, lordly elephant, deer, and horse—eyes wide and terrible, the
  destroyer of even the gods’ pride—he is there.
'24': >-
  “Where that white parasol, like the moon, with its excellent slender ribs,
  shines—there is the great-souled lord of rākṣasas himself, resplendent like
  Rudra surrounded by spirits.
'25': >-
  “That rākṣasa-lord—crowned, with face adorned by swinging earrings, of
  terrible body like a mountain or the Vindhya—crusher of the pride of Mahendra
  and Vaivasvata—shines like the sun.”
'26': >-
  Then Rāma, subduer of foes, replied to Vibhīṣaṇa: “Ah! Ravana, lord of
  rākṣasas, possesses blazing and mighty splendor.”
'27': >-
  “Like the sun, hard to look upon, Ravana shines with his rays; indeed I cannot
  clearly discern his form, veiled by radiance.”
'28': >-
  “Such a body would not be found even among the heroes of gods and dānavas, as
  this body of the rākṣasa-king shines forth.”
'29': >-
  “All his warriors are like mountains in stature, all are fighters amid
  mountains; all bear blazing weapons—warriors of that great-souled one.”
'30': >-
  “That king of rākṣasas shines with fiery, fearsome-looking attendants—sharp,
  embodied beings—like Death himself surrounded by spirits.”
'31': >-
  “Fortunate indeed that this sinner has today come within the range of my
  sight. Today I shall release the wrath born from the abduction of Sītā.”
'32': >-
  Having spoken thus, the mighty Rāma took up his bow; accompanied by Lakṣmaṇa,
  he stood with an excellent arrow drawn forth, ready.
'33': >-
  Then the great-souled lord of rākṣasas addressed those mighty rākṣasas: “Stand
  well-content and unafraid at the gates, in the streets, in the houses, and
  upon the ramparts.”
'34': >-
  “Knowing this weakness of the forest-dwellers, should they, united, assault
  this city—empty of me and hard to overcome—they might suddenly storm and
  violate it.”
'35': >-
  Having dismissed those counselors and, when the rākṣasas had gone according to
  his command, he tore into the ocean-like surge of the monkey host, like a
  great fish cleaving the flooded ocean.
'36': >-
  Seeing the rākṣasa-king in battle, suddenly charging with bow and flaming
  arrows, the lord of monkeys (Sugrīva) tore up a great mountain-peak and rushed
  upon the lord of rākṣasas.
'37': >-
  Grasping that mountain-horn, with many trees upon its slopes, he hurled it at
  the night-ranger; seeing it suddenly fall upon him, Ravana cut it with arrows
  tipped with golden feathers.
'38': >-
  When that peak—thick with great trees—was split and fell upon the earth, the
  lord of the rākṣasa realm fitted to his bow a shaft like a mighty serpent,
  resembling Death itself.
'39': >-
  Seizing that arrow—swift as the wind, blazing like a spark-filled flame, with
  the speed of Indra’s thunderbolt—he, enraged, hurled it to slay Sugrīva.
'40': >-
  That missile, released from Ravana’s arm, shining like Indra’s thunderbolt,
  struck Sugrīva and pierced him with speed, like a terrible spear driven into
  the Krauncha mountain by Guha.
'41': >-
  Wounded by the arrow, his mind overturned, the hero fell upon the earth with
  cries; seeing him fallen senseless on the ground, the rākṣasas roared in
  battle, exultant.
'42': >-
  Then Gavākṣa, Gavaya, Suṣeṇa, Ṛṣabha, Jyotimukha, and Nala too—enlarged in
  form—tore up mountains and rushed toward the rākṣasa-king.
'43': >-
  The lord of rākṣasas made their blows vain with hundreds of sharp-pointed
  arrows, and with nets of arrows whose shafts were adorned with golden-hued,
  variegated feathers, he pierced those monkey chiefs as well.
'44': >-
  Those monkey lords, pierced by the arrows of the foe of the gods, fell upon
  the earth, huge-bodied; then he covered that fierce monkey army with showers
  and meshes of arrows.
'45': >-
  Slain and fallen, those heroes—roaring, pierced by the dart of fear—afflicted
  by Ravana’s arrows, the branch-moving monkeys took refuge, seeking refuge in
  Rāma.
'46': >-
  Then the great-souled Rāma, wielder of the bow, taking up his bow, went forth
  at once; Lakṣmaṇa approached him with joined palms and spoke words suited to
  the highest purpose.
'47': >-
  “O noble one, I am fully sufficient to slay this wicked-souled Ravana. I shall
  crush him; grant me leave, O Lord.”
'48': >-
  To him spoke the great-splendored Rāma, whose valor is true: “Go, Lakṣmaṇa; be
  diligent, and be steadfast in battle.”
'49': >-
  “For Ravana is of great heroism, of wondrous prowess in war; even when enraged
  by the three worlds he is hard to withstand—of this there is no doubt.”
'50': >-
  “Seek out his vulnerabilities, and mark your own vulnerabilities too. With
  eyes and bow, protect yourself, collected and intent.”
'51': >-
  Hearing Rāghava’s words, the son of Sumitrā embraced and honored him; then,
  having saluted Rāma, he went to the battle.
'52': >-
  He beheld Ravana—arms like an elephant’s trunk—holding aloft a blazing,
  dreadful bow, covering with networks of arrow-showers those monkeys, whose
  bodies were split and scattered.
'53': >-
  Seeing him, the great-splendored Hanumān, son of the Wind, warded off the
  arrow-nets and rushed toward Ravana.
'54': >-
  Reaching his chariot and lifting his right arm, the wise Hanumān, terrifying
  Ravana, spoke these words:
'55': >-
  “By gods, dānavas, gandharvas, and yakṣas, together with rākṣasas, you have
  obtained invulnerability; but from monkeys, fear is yours!”
'56': >-
  “This is my right arm, raised—five-branched (hand with five fingers). It shall
  shatter in your body that spirit which has dwelt there long.”
'57': >-
  Hearing Hanumān’s words, Ravana of dreadful valor, his eyes reddened with
  anger, spoke thus:
'58': >-
  “Strike quickly, without fear, and win firm fame. Then I shall destroy you, O
  monkey, when your prowess is known.”
'59': >-
  Hearing Ravana’s speech, the son of the Wind replied: “Remember—earlier I
  struck down Akṣa, your son.”
'60': >-
  Thus addressed, Ravana, the great-splendored lord of rākṣasas, struck the son
  of the Wind, the mighty one, on the chest with the palm of his hand.
'61': >-
  Struck by that palm, he reeled again and again; the radiant, great-minded
  Hanumān stood for a moment, then, steadying himself, endured.
'62': >-
  Then, enraged, he too struck the foe of the gods with his own palm. Thereupon,
  smitten by that great-souled monkey,
'63': >-
  Daśagrīva was shaken, as a mountain is shaken upon the face of the earth.
  Seeing Ravana thus struck with the palm in battle,
'64': >-
  Sages, perfected beings, and monkeys roared; and the gods, together with the
  asuras, cried out. Then Ravana, of great splendor, spoke:
'65': >-
  “Well done, O monkey; by your valor you are praiseworthy as my enemy.” Thus
  spoken to by Ravana, Māruti replied:
'66': >-
  “Shame upon my valor, that you yet live, O Ravana! Strike once now, fool of
  evil counsel—why do you boast?”
'67': >-
  “Then my fist shall send you to Yama’s abode.” By Hanumān’s words, Ravana’s
  rage blazed up.
'68': >-
  With eyes reddened, clenching his right fist with effort, the mighty one
  brought it down with speed upon the monkey’s chest.
'69': >-
  Hanumān, his broad chest struck, reeled again and again. Seeing the mighty
  Hanumān thus wavering,
'70': >-
  Daśagrīva, lord of rākṣasas, the glorious atiratha, swiftly advanced by
  chariot against Nīla.
'71': >-
  With dreadful arrows like serpents—piercing the vital joints and cleaving the
  deepest organs—he set Nīla, commander of the monkey host, ablaze (as it were)
  with arrow-strokes.
'72': >-
  Nīla, assailed by that multitude of arrows, the monkey commander, with one
  hand hurled a mountain-peak at the lord of rākṣasas.
'73': >-
  Hanumān also, radiant and great-minded, reassured, looking on and desiring
  battle, spoke these words in anger:
'74': >-
  “It is not proper to rush upon Ravana, lord of rākṣasas, when he is engaged in
  combat with Nīla; let him fight another.”
'75': >-
  Then Ravana, of great splendor, struck that mountain-horn with seven arrows,
  exceedingly sharp-pointed, and it fell down shattered.
'76': >-
  Seeing that mountain-peak shattered, Nīla, commander of the monkey host, who
  slays enemy-heroes, blazed with anger like the fire of Time at the end of the
  age.
'77': >-
  He hurled in battle aśvakarṇa trees, śālas, mango trees in full blossom, and
  various other trees as well.
'78': >-
  Ravana, meeting those trees, cut them down in return, and rained upon Nīla a
  terrible shower of arrows, like fire.
'79': >-
  Rained upon by that torrent of arrows like a great mountain by a cloud, he
  then made his form small and alighted upon the tip of the banner.
'80': >-
  Seeing the son of Agni (Nīla) stationed on the banner’s summit, Ravana flared
  with wrath; then Nīla roared.
'81': >-
  Seeing that ape upon the banner-tip, upon the bow-tip, and upon the crown-tip
  (near Ravana), Lakṣmaṇa, Hanumān, and Rāma too were exceedingly astonished.
'82': >-
  Ravana also, of great splendor, amazed at the monkey’s agility, brought forth
  a blazing, wondrous fire-weapon (āgneya astra).
'83': >-
  Then the monkeys, delighted as if having gained their aim, cried out, seeing
  Ravana in battle confounded by Nīla’s agility.
'84': >-
  Stirred by the monkeys’ roaring, Ravana then, his heart seized by agitation,
  could settle upon nothing.
'85': >-
  Taking an arrow joined with the fire-weapon, Ravana the night-ranger fixed his
  gaze upon Nīla who stood atop the banner’s head.
'86': >-
  Then spoke the great-splendored Ravana, lord of rākṣasas: “O monkey, you are
  endowed with swiftness together with supreme illusion.”
'87': >-
  “Protect your life indeed, if you are able, O monkey. You assume many forms,
  one after another, in manifold ways.”
'88': >-
  “Even so, the arrow released by me, empowered by a weapon, while you strive to
  preserve your life, shall deprive you of life.”
'89': >-
  Having spoken thus, the mighty-armed Ravana, lord of rākṣasas, setting the
  arrow with the weapon, struck the commander of the host.
'90': >-
  Struck on the chest by that weapon-released arrow, Nīla, suddenly burning (as
  it were), fell upon the earth.
'91': >-
  Through the greatness of his ancestry (his father’s majesty) and by his own
  radiance, he fell upon the ground upon his knees, yet did not part from life.
'92': >-
  Seeing the monkey unconscious, Daśagrīva, eager for battle, rushed by chariot
  with cloud-like roar against Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa).
'93': >-
  Reaching him in the midst of battle, he checked him and stood blazing; the
  mighty rākṣasa-king twanged and stretched his bow.
'94': >-
  Then Saumitri, of unyielding spirit, spoke to him as he twanged that
  immeasurable bow: “Know me today, O lord of night-rangers—you do not deserve
  to fight the monkeys.”
'95': >-
  Hearing Saumitri’s words, full and resonant, and the fierce sound of the
  bowstring, the king approached him who stood before him; the rākṣasa, filled
  with rage, spoke:
'96': >-
  “Fortunate am I, O Rāghava, that you have come within my sight—going to your
  end, of perverse intent. This very moment you shall go to the world of Death,
  overwhelmed by my nets of arrows.”
'97': >-
  Saumitri, unastonished, spoke to him as he roared, showing his bared,
  sharp-pointed fangs: “O king, the mighty do not roar. You boast—foremost among
  evil-doers!”
'98': >-
  “I know your prowess, O rākṣasa-king—your strength, your majesty, and your
  valor. I stand here with bow and arrows in hand; come—what is the use of vain
  boasting?”
'99': >-
  Thus addressed, the enraged lord of rākṣasas discharged seven well-feathered
  arrows; Lakṣmaṇa cut them down with sharp arrows whose golden, variegated
  feathers shone.
'100': >-
  Seeing them suddenly severed like serpent-kings with their coils cut, the lord
  of Laṅkā was seized by wrath and released other keen shafts.
'101': >-
  Then Rāma’s younger brother poured forth a fierce rain of arrows, bow-joined;
  with razor-edged, half-moon heads and the finest karnis and bhallas, he cut
  down the arrows, and did not waver.
'102': >-
  Seeing those arrow-nets again and again rendered futile, the king who was the
  enemy of the gods marveled at Lakṣmaṇa’s agility, and once more let loose
  sharp arrows.
'103': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa too, like great Indra, fitting to his bow keen, sharp-pointed shafts,
  blazing like fire and terrible in speed like thunderbolts, shot them forth to
  slay the lord of rākṣasas.
'104': >-
  The rākṣasa-king cut down those keen arrows and struck Lakṣmaṇa; with an arrow
  resembling the fire of Time at the end of the age, bestowed by Svayambhū
  (Brahmā), he hit him on the forehead.
'105': >-
  Wounded by Ravana’s arrow, Lakṣmaṇa reeled, holding his bow slack; then,
  regaining consciousness with difficulty, he cut the bow of the enemy of the
  lord of the gods.
'106': >-
  When his bow was cut, Daśaratha’s son struck him then with three sharp-pointed
  arrows; pierced by the shafts, the king staggered, and with effort recovered
  consciousness again.
'107': >-
  His bow severed and struck by arrows, his body smeared with fat and drenched
  in blood, the foe of the gods, of fierce might, seized a śakti (dart)—a
  dreadful weapon bestowed by Svayambhū.
'108': >-
  That spear, like smoky fire, terrifying to the monkeys in battle, blazing, the
  lord of the rākṣasa realm hurled with force at Saumitri.
'109': >-
  Bharata’s younger brother struck it with weapon-arrows and with shafts like
  sacrificial fire; yet that śakti entered the broad space between the arms of
  Daśaratha’s son.
'110': >-
  Though possessed of power, struck by the śakti, that foremost of the Raghu
  line blazed upon the ground; the king rushed upon him and seized him swiftly
  with both arms.
'111': >-
  Himālaya, Mandara, Meru—or even the three worlds with the gods—could be lifted
  up with one’s arms; but Bharata’s younger brother could not be lifted.
'112': >-
  Though struck between the breasts by the Brahmā-śakti, Saumitri recalled
  within himself that immeasurable portion of Viṣṇu (present in him).
'113': >-
  Then the tormentor of dānavas’ pride, the thorn to the gods, having pressed
  Saumitri with his arms, was not able to carry him away.
'114': >-
  Then the enraged son of the Wind rushed upon Ravana and, wrathful, struck him
  on the chest with a fist like a thunderbolt.
'115': >-
  By that blow of the fist, Ravana, lord of rākṣasas, went down upon his knees
  to the ground; he tottered and fell.
'116': >-
  From his mouth, eyes, and ears much blood fell; whirling and motionless, he
  sat down upon the seat of his chariot.
'117': >-
  Unconscious and fainted, he could not steady himself. Seeing Ravana of
  dreadful prowess thus insensible in the battle,
'118': >-
  the sages and monkeys roared, and the gods with the asuras cried aloud. Then
  the radiant Hanumān saw Lakṣmaṇa afflicted by Ravana,
'119': >-
  and carried him near Rāghava, clasping him in his arms. Through friendship
  with the son of the Wind and with supreme devotion, he—though unshakable even
  by enemies—seemed to become light upon the monkey’s shoulder.
'120': >-
  Abandoning Saumitri, conquered in battle, that śakti returned to its place
  again upon Ravana’s chariot.
'121': >-
  Ravana too, of great splendor, regaining consciousness in that great battle,
  took up sharp arrows and seized a mighty bow.
'122': >-
  Reassured and freed from the spear, Lakṣmaṇa, slayer of foes, recalling within
  himself that immeasurable portion of Viṣṇu, stood firm.
'123': >-
  But Rāghava, seeing in battle the great monkey host cast down though of great
  heroism, rushed upon Ravana.
'124': >-
  Then, drawing close, Hanumān spoke these words: “Mount upon my back and
  chastise the rākṣasa.”
'125': >-
  “As Viṣṇu, mounting Garuḍa, attacks the enemy of the gods.” Hearing that
  speech spoken by the Wind’s son,
'126': >-
  Rāghava at once mounted the great monkey Hanumān, and in that conflict the
  lord of men beheld Ravana standing on his chariot.
'127': >-
  Seeing him, Rāma of great splendor rushed upon Ravana, like Viṣṇu—weapon
  raised—rushing in wrath upon Virocana (Bali).
'128': >-
  Rāma made a fierce sound of the bowstring, harsh as the grinding of a
  thunderbolt; then, in a deep voice, he addressed the rākṣasa-king:
'129': >-
  “Stand, stand! For after doing such grievous wrong to me, where now, O tiger
  among rākṣasas, having gone, will you obtain release?”
'130': >-
  “Whether you go to Indra, to Vaivasvata (Yama), to the Sun, to Svayambhū
  (Brahmā), to Vaiśvānara (Agni), or to Śaṅkara; or whether you flee to the ten
  directions—still, you shall not escape me today.”
'131': >-
  “And he whom you have struck down today with the śakti, going into sudden
  despair—he, O lord of rākṣasa hosts, is today in this battle your death, with
  your sons and grandsons.”
'132': >-
  “By this (Lakṣmaṇa) have been slain with arrows thousands of rākṣasas and the
  fourteen weapons you took up; he has made his dwelling in Janasthāna—wondrous
  to behold—through his shafts.”
'133': >-
  Hearing Rāghava’s words, the rākṣasa-king of great might beheld the Wind’s
  son, of great speed, bearing Rāghava in battle,
'134': >-
  and, seized with great fury, remembering the former enmity, he struck with
  blazing arrows like the flames of the fire of Time.
'135': >-
  Though struck in battle by the rākṣasa’s arrows, the Wind’s son—endowed with
  his natural radiance—grew ever more brilliant.
'136': >-
  Then Rāma, of great splendor, seeing the foremost of monkeys wounded by
  Ravana, came under the sway of wrath.
'137': >-
  Advancing upon his chariot—with wheels, horses, banner, parasol, and great
  standard—and with charioteer, and weapons of thunderbolt, trident, and sword,
  Rāma with keen arrow-heads cut it to pieces.
'138': >-
  Then, with speed, he struck the enemy of Indra with an arrow like a
  thunderbolt and lightning, between his arms—broad, firm, and well-formed—like
  Indra striking Meru with the vajra.
'139': >-
  He who had not been shaken by the fall of thunderbolts or by
  lightning-strokes, that king—struck by Rāma’s arrow—was grievously pained; he
  reeled, and the hero let fall his bow.
'140': >-
  Seeing him wavering, Rāma took up a blazing half-moon arrow; with it the
  great-souled one swiftly cut off the sun-colored crown of the lord of
  rākṣasas.
'141': >-
  Then, like a serpent bereft of poison, like the sun with its rays quenched and
  no longer shining, deprived of splendor, his crown-top cut away, Rāma spoke to
  the rākṣasa-king in battle:
'142': >-
  “You have done a great deed, most dreadful; by you I have been made bereft of
  foremost warriors. Therefore, resolving that you are weary, I shall not, with
  arrows, send you into Death’s power.”
'143': >-
  “Go— I know you are afflicted by battle. Enter Laṅkā, O king of night-rangers.
  Having rested, come forth again—charioteer and archer—then, from your chariot,
  you shall behold my strength.”
'144': >-
  Thus addressed, his pride and joy slain, his bow cut, his horses and
  charioteer destroyed, pierced by arrows and his great crown broken, the king
  suddenly entered Laṅkā.
'145': >-
  When that mighty lord of night-rangers—enemy of gods and dānavas—had entered
  (the city), Rāma, at the forefront of the great battle, made the monkeys and
  Lakṣmaṇa free of darts and wounds.
'146': >-
  When that foe of the lord of the gods was routed, the gods and asuras, hosts
  of spirits, and the quarters of space, with oceans, sages, and great serpents,
  and likewise the beings that move on land and in water, rejoiced greatly.
'147': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-ninth canto, named “The Anointing (Consecration) of
  Ravana,” in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
