  Now begins the fifteenth chapter in the Kishkindha-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, entitled “Tara’s Wholesome Counsel.”
'1': >-
  Then Vali—who could not endure any affront to his brother—having entered the
  inner apartments, heard that roar of the great-souled Sugriva.
'2': >-
  But on hearing that cry, which made all beings tremble, his intoxication
  vanished in that very instant, and a mighty wrath arose within him.
'3': >-
  Thereupon Vali, his limbs overwhelmed by rage, that golden-radiant lord of
  monkeys, became at once as though the sun were eclipsed—his brightness
  obscured.
'4': >-
  Vali, dreadful with bared fangs, his eyes like blazing fire through anger,
  shone like a lake whose lotuses have been torn up, with their stalks and
  fibers scattered.
'5': >-
  Hearing the unbearable sound, the monkey-lord sprang forth, and with the force
  of his strides seemed to split the very earth beneath his feet.
'6': >-
  But Tara, embracing him, showing affection and friendship, spoke—frightened
  and agitated—these words whose outcome was beneficial:
'7': >-
  “Well indeed is this anger that has come upon you like the rush of a river’s
  flood; yet, O hero, having risen from your bed at dawn, cast it off, like a
  garland already worn and enjoyed.”
'8': >-
  “At dawn, O monkey, you will wage battle by this means; and, O hero, neither
  is there any weakness in you, nor is the power of your foes too great for
  you.”
'9': >-
  “Yet your sudden going forth does not, for the present, please me. Listen: I
  shall tell the reason for which restraint is called for.”
'10': >-
  “Formerly, in his anger, he challenged you to battle; then, rushing out, he
  was repulsed by you, and when struck he went off in various directions.”
'11': >-
  “That he—thrown off by you, and especially afflicted—has come here again to
  challenge you, raises suspicion in my mind.”
'12': >-
  “The pride and resolve of that roaring one, and the vehemence of his cry—this
  is surely no small cause.”
'13': >-
  “I do not think Sugriva has come here without help. He has secured support,
  relying on which he now roars thus.”
'14': >-
  “By nature Sugriva is skilful and also intelligent; he will not enter into
  friendship with one whose prowess has not been tested.”
'15': >-
  “Long ago, O hero, I heard the words spoken and reported by Angada, the
  prince. Today I shall tell you that beneficial counsel.”
'16': >-
  “This prince Angada went out into the depths of the forest; through him the
  tidings were learned, and by spies they were conveyed to us.”
'17': >-
  “There are two sons of the lord of Ayodhya—valiant, unconquerable in
  battle—born in the lineage of the Ikshvakus, renowned as Rama and Lakshmana.”
'18': >-
  “For the sake of fulfilling what is dear to Sugriva, those two, difficult to
  assail, have come there; and he is well known as your brother’s helper in
  deeds of war.”
'19': >-
  “Rama is a crusher of the enemy’s host, risen like the fire at the dissolution
  of the age; he is the sheltering tree of the righteous, and the supreme refuge
  of the distressed.”
'20': >-
  “He is the asylum of the afflicted, the sole receptacle of glory, endowed with
  knowledge and discernment, and ever devoted to obeying his father’s command.”
'21': >-
  “Like a mountain-chief among minerals, he is a great mine of virtues.
  Therefore you are not fit to be at enmity with that great-souled one.”
'22': >-
  “O hero, concerning Rama—unconquerable and beyond measure in deeds of battle—I
  shall tell you something; yet I do not wish to speak with ill-will.”
'23': >-
  “Listen and act accordingly: I shall tell you what is for your good. Speedily
  consecrate Sugriva as heir-apparent, with the office of yuvaraja.”
'24': >-
  “Do not, O hero—O king—enter into conflict with your younger brother. For I
  deem your friendship with that Rama to be proper and fitting.”
'25': >-
  “And, casting away enmity far off, cultivate affection with Sugriva. This
  younger brother of yours, this monkey, ought indeed to be cherished.”
'26': >-
  “Whether he be there or present near at hand, in every way he is your own
  kinsman; for on earth I see none who is a kinsman equal to him.”
'27': >-
  “By gifts, honor, and every form of kindly reception, win him back without
  delay. Casting away this hostility, let him remain at your side.”
'28': >-
  “Sugriva of broad neck is regarded by you as a great kinsman. Clinging to
  brotherly affection, you have no other course here.”
'29': >-
  “If you would do what is dear to me, and if you know me to be well-wishing,
  then, since I ask you out of love, do well to follow my words.”
'30': >-
  “Be gracious; hear my wholesome speech. You ought not to pursue only wrath.
  For, with the son of the king of Kosala—whose splendor is like
  Indra’s—conflict is not fitting for you, nor are you equal to it.”
'31': >-
  Then indeed Tara spoke to that Vali this salutary, beneficial counsel; but
  those words were not pleasing to him, for he was seized by Time, at the hour
  of his destruction.
'32': >-
  Thus ends the fifteenth chapter in the Kishkindha-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Prime Epic, entitled “Tara’s Wholesome Counsel.”
