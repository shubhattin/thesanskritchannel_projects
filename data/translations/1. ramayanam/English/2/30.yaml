  Now begins the thirtieth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Resolve Concerning the Going to the Forest.”
'1': >-
  While she was being gently consoled by Rāma, Maithilī—Janaka’s daughter—spoke
  these words to her husband, with reference to the cause of dwelling in the
  forest.
'2': >-
  Sītā, deeply agitated though she was, cast her look upon Rāghava of broad
  chest—moved by love and also by wounded pride.
'3': >-
  “What else will my father, the lord of Mithilā—Vaideha Janaka—say, having
  obtained as son-in-law, O Rāma, a woman who bears the form of a man?”
'4': >-
  “Truly, this world will speak falsehood out of ignorance—(saying) that there
  is no supreme valor in Rāma, who blazes like the sun.”
'5': >-
  “What have you done to become thus downcast? From where can fear arise for
  you, that you wish to abandon me who am devoted to none but you?”
'6': >-
  “Know me to be like Sāvitrī—faithfully devoted to her heroic husband Satyavān,
  the son of Dyumatsena—(know me) one who is under the control of her own self.”
'7': >-
  “I shall never, even in my mind, look upon any other than you, O sinless one.
  With you, O Rāghava, I shall go—unlike some other woman, a disgrace to her
  lineage.”
'8': >-
  “Though I am your wedded wife, a chaste woman who has long dwelt with you
  since maidenhood, O Rāma—do you wish to give me to others, like an actor
  (handing over a role)?”
'9': >-
  “He whose welfare you pursue, for whose sake you restrain yourself—be obedient
  to him and ever compliant, O faultless one.”
'10': >-
  “Without taking me along, you ought not set out for the forest. If there is
  austerity, let it be in the woods with you; if there is heaven, let it be with
  you.”
'11': >-
  “Nor will there be any fatigue for me on that journey—walking behind you will
  be as though in pleasures, as though in bed and at leisure.”
'12': >-
  “Kuśa grass, kāśa grass, reeds, and thorny trees—on the road they will feel to
  me, with you beside me, like cotton and soft deerskin.”
'13': >-
  “Whatever dust, raised by great winds, may settle upon me, beloved— I shall
  deem it like sandalpaste of highest price.”
'14': >-
  “When I sleep upon grassy ground within the forest, living as a
  forest-dweller—upon a spread of kuśa mats—what could be more comfortable than
  that?”
'15': >-
  “Whatever leaf, root, or fruit you give—whether little or much—brought by your
  own hand, that will be to me like nectar in taste.”
'16': >-
  “There I shall not remember my mother, nor my father, nor my home—enjoying in
  their season flowers and fruits.”
'17': >-
  “And there you need not see anything displeasing on my account; nor shall you
  grieve for me—I shall not be a burden.”
'18': >-
  “Heaven is that which is with you; hell is that which is without you. Knowing
  this as my highest love—go, O Rāma, with me.”
'19': >-
  “If, though I am thus resolved, you will not take me to the forest, then I
  shall drink deadly poison; I will not come under the power of those who hate
  you.”
'20': >-
  “Indeed, afterward too, my life will not endure in misery; if abandoned by
  you, O lord, then death at once is better.”
'21': >-
  “I am not able to bear this grief even for a moment—how much less, afflicted
  as I am, for thirteen years and ten!”
'22': >-
  Thus she, scorched by sorrow, lamenting piteously again and again, cried out
  loudly to her husband, clinging to him in a tight embrace.
'23': >-
  Wounded by many words, like a female elephant scorched by fire, she let forth
  long-held tears, as fire is released from the araṇi sticks.
'24': >-
  From her two lotus-like eyes streamed water, clear like crystal, born of that
  burning anguish—like water flowing from twin lotuses.
'25': >-
  Then her face—white and pure like the moon, with long eyes—was dried by tears,
  like a lotus drawn out of the water.
'26': >-
  Embracing her with his arms as she grieved like one unconscious, Rāma then
  spoke words to reassure her.
'27': >-
  “O lady, indeed, because of grief I would not choose even heaven. For I have
  no fear whatsoever, like the Self-existent Lord (Brahmā) from every quarter.”
'28': >-
  “Not knowing your full intention, O fair-faced one, I did not approve of
  dwelling in the wilderness, though I am capable of protecting (you).”
'29': >-
  “Since you have been joined with me for dwelling in the forest, O Maithilī, I
  cannot forsake you—(for) such is the love of one who is master of himself.”
'30': >-
  “But dharma, O large-eyed and fair-thighed one, was practiced by the good in
  former times. That I shall follow, as Suvarcalā follows the Sun.”
'31': >-
  “Truly, I would not go to the forest, O delight of Janaka, but that word of my
  father—fortified by truth—drives me to it.”
'32': >-
  “This is dharma, O fair-hipped one: obedience to father and mother.
  Transgressing his command, I do not wish to live.”
'33': >-
  “How can fate—which is not under one’s control—be propitiated by various
  means, after overstepping what is under one’s control: one’s mother, father,
  and guru?”
'34': >-
  “Where these three are, there are the three worlds; nothing on earth is equal
  to that purifier. There is nothing else, O auspicious-glancing one—by that
  alone is this to be fulfilled.”
'35': >-
  “Neither truthfulness, nor charity, nor honor, nor sacrifices rich in priestly
  fees—are so power-giving, O Sītā, as service rendered to one’s father is held
  to be.”
'36': >-
  “Heaven, wealth, grain, learning, sons, and pleasures—by deference to the
  conduct due to elders, nothing at all is unattainable.”
'37': >-
  “Divine realms, Gandharva realms, the world of cows (Go-loka), the world of
  Brahmā, and other worlds besides—these great-souled ones attain, who are
  devoted to mother and father.”
'38': >-
  “Therefore, as my father instructs me—standing on the path of truth and
  dharma—so I desire to conduct myself; for that dharma is eternal.”
'39': >-
  “My resolve, O Sītā, is fixed—to take you to the Daṇḍaka forest. Since you are
  determined to follow me, (know) that I shall dwell (there).”
'40': >-
  “Therefore, O flawless-limbed one, O doe-eyed lady—follow me to the forest, O
  timid one; become my companion in dharma.”
'41': >-
  “In every way, O Sītā, you have undertaken a resolve fitting for me and for my
  own lineage; O beloved, you are exceedingly radiant.”
'42': >-
  “Begin, O fair-hipped one, the preparations suitable for dwelling in the
  forest. Now, without you, O Sītā, even heaven does not please me.”
'43': >-
  “Give jewels to the Brāhmaṇas, and food to the mendicants; give also to those
  who ask—make haste, and do not delay.”
'44': >-
  “The precious ornaments, the fine garments, and whatever delightful things
  there are—also the equipments meant for recreation—(distribute them).”
'45': >-
  “Beds and vehicles—those of mine and whatever others there are—give to the
  assemblage of our attendants, after (giving to) the Brāhmaṇas.”
'46': >-
  Knowing her own departure to be agreeable to her husband, the blessed
  lady—quickly and joyfully—began to give (in charity) indeed.
'47': >-
  Then that renowned woman, her heart filled to the brim with gladness, having
  looked to her husband’s words, began to give away wealth and
  jewels—high-minded, upholding dharma among the righteous.
'48': >-
  Thus ends the thirtieth sarga, called “The Resolve Concerning the Going to the
  Forest,” in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial
  epic.
