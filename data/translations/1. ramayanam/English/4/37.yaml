  Now begins the thirty-seventh chapter, named “The Mustering of the Monkey
  Army,” in the Kishkindha Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by the great-souled Lakshmaṇa, Sugrīva spoke these words to
  Hanūmān, who stood at his side:
'2': >-
  “On the peaks of Mahendra, Himavat, Vindhya, and Kailāsa, and on Mandara and
  Pāṇḍuśikhara, and upon the five great mountains—those hosts that dwell there—
'3': >-
  “and those who abide on mountains at the ocean’s edge in the western quarter,
  ever resplendent, of the hue of the rising sun—
'4': >-
  “and those mighty leaders of the monkeys who resort to the dreadful Padmācala
  forest on the mountain called Ādityabhavana, which is like the twilight-cloud
  in appearance—
'5': >-
  “and those monkeys who dwell on Mount Añjana—dark as rain-clouds, possessed of
  the great might of lordly elephants—
'6': >-
  “and those golden-hued vānaras who dwell in caves of vast mountains, those
  stationed on the flank of Meru, and those who have taken refuge in Dhūmrāgiri—
'7': >-
  “and those swift and terrible monkey-warriors on the great red mountain, of
  the color of the young sun, who drink honey and strong liquor—
'8': >-
  “and those in exceedingly lovely, fragrant, and great forests, and in woodland
  tracts all around that are delightful with hermitages of ascetics—
'9': >-
  “all those, and every monkey upon the earth—bring them here quickly, by
  whatever means are fit, whether conciliation, gifts, or other measures,
  through swift-moving monkeys.
'10': >-
  “And those who were first dispatched by me—those of great speed whom I
  commanded—send them again, you too, to hasten the monkey-lords here.”
'11': >-
  “Those monkeys who are attached to pleasures and who are slack and
  dilatory—bring them here at once, all those monkey-kings without exception.”
'12': >-
  “And those wicked ones who, in ten days, do not come by my command—let them be
  slain, for they corrupt the king’s authority and violate royal rule.”
'13': >-
  “Let hundreds, and likewise thousands, and crores, as my command goes
  forth—let those lion-like monkeys who stand under my direction set out at my
  bidding.”
'14': >-
  “Let the foremost of monkeys, dreadful in form, like cloud-capped mountains,
  as though covering the sky, depart at once under my command.”
'15': >-
  “Knowing the ways of travel, let all monkeys, going swiftly across the earth,
  bring every monkey here in haste, by my command.”
'16': >-
  Hearing the words of that king of the monkeys, the son of Vāyu (Hanūmān)
  dispatched valiant monkeys in all directions.
'17': >-
  Those monkeys—shining like the flight of birds and coursing along the luminous
  paths—set out, sent by the king, in that very instant, with a stride like
  Viṣṇu’s far-ranging step.
'18': >-
  In oceans, on mountains, in forests, and beside lakes, those monkeys urged all
  other monkeys to action for Rāma’s sake.
'19': >-
  Hearing the command of Sugrīva—like the very hour of death—those monkeys
  hastened, fearful and anxious of Sugrīva’s displeasure.
'20': >-
  Then, from that mountain—mighty monkeys, dark like collyrium—three crores of
  plavagas marched out to the place where Rāghava was.
'21': >-
  From the best of mountains where the sun goes to set, devoted to that region,
  ten crores more, glowing like heated gold, set forth from there.
'22': >-
  And from the peaks of Kailāsa—having the splendor of lions’ manes—there
  gathered then thousands of crores of monkeys.
'23': >-
  Living on fruits and roots, resorting to Himavat, among those thousands of
  crores, a thousand (crores) assembled there.
'24': >-
  From Vindhya, swiftly poured forth thousands of crores of monkeys—terrible,
  like burning embers, and terrible in their deeds.
'25': >-
  From the shores where the Milk Ocean lies, dwelling in tamāla-groves, and
  feeding on coconuts—of those, their number cannot be known.
'26': >-
  From forests, from caverns, and from rivers, the mighty monkey army
  came—appearing as though it were drinking up the sun itself.
'27': >-
  But those heroic monkeys who had gone to quicken all the monkeys, upon the
  Himavat mountain beheld that great tree.
'28': >-
  On that sacred best of mountains, in former times a sacrifice to Maheśvara
  (Śiva) had been performed—most delightful, bringing satisfaction to the minds
  of all the gods.
'29': >-
  There the monkeys saw roots and fruits that had arisen from the overflow of
  sacrificial food—having a sweetness comparable to nectar.
'30': >-
  That divine, enchanting fare of fruits and roots, born of the sacrificial
  food—whoever eats it but once remains satisfied for a month.
'31': >-
  Those best of monkeys, living on fruits, gathered those divine roots and
  fruits, and also divine medicinal herbs.
'32': >-
  And from that sacrificial sanctuary they also brought fragrant flowers, having
  gone for the sake of pleasing Sugrīva.
'33': >-
  Then all those excellent monkeys, having roused all monkeys upon the earth,
  went swiftly at the head of their troops.
'34': >-
  At that very moment, those swift-moving monkeys reached Kiṣkindhā in
  haste—where Sugrīva, the monkey-king, was.
'35': >-
  Taking all the medicinal herbs, and fruits and roots, the monkeys presented
  them to him and spoke these words:
'36': >-
  “All the mountains have been scoured, and the rivers and forests as well; and
  all monkeys upon the earth are coming, in obedience to your command.”
'37': >-
  Hearing thus, Sugrīva, lord of the plavagas, became delighted; and pleased, he
  accepted all their offerings.
'38': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-seventh chapter, named “The Mustering of the Monkey
  Army,” in Kishkindha Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the holy epic.
