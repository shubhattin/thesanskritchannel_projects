  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the forty-ninth
  sarga, entitled “The Abduction of Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of Sītā, the mighty, valiant Ten-necked Rāvaṇa struck one
  hand upon the other, and assumed a most enormous form.
'2': >-
  Then that master of speech addressed the daughter of Mithilā again, saying: “I
  do not think that in your hearing my strength and prowess have been truly
  understood, as though you were beside yourself.”
'3': >-
  “Standing in the sky, I could lift up the earth with my two arms; I could
  drink up the ocean; and, standing firm in battle, I could slay even Death.”
'4': >-
  “With sharp arrows I could smite the sun; indeed I could cleave the very
  surface of the earth. O deluded one, behold me—one who can assume forms at
  will—displaying such power.”
'5': >-
  As Rāvaṇa spoke thus, O Sītā of peacock-like splendor, the eyes of that
  enraged one became red at the corners.
'6': >-
  At once, abandoning his gentle guise, Rāvaṇa—Kubera’s younger brother—assumed
  his own fierce form, dreadful like the form of Time (Death).
'7': >-
  His eyes were bloodshot; he was magnificent, adorned with ornaments of heated
  gold; seized by tremendous wrath, he appeared like a dark-blue raincloud.
'8': >-
  That night-ranging being became ten-faced and twenty-armed; casting off the
  disguise of a wandering ascetic, that great-bodied one—Rāvaṇa—did so.
'9': >-
  Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, regained his own form; clad in red garments, he
  stood gazing upon Maithilī, that jewel among women.
'10': >-
  Rāvaṇa then spoke to Maithilī, whose dark tresses framed her face, who shone
  like the radiance of the sun, and who was adorned with garments and ornaments.
'11': >-
  “If you desire a husband renowned in the three worlds, then take refuge in me,
  O fair-hipped lady; I am a husband worthy of you.”
'12': >-
  “Serve me for a long time; I shall be your praiseworthy husband. And never, O
  auspicious one, will I do anything that is displeasing to you.”
'13': >-
  “Let the thought of a mere man be abandoned; let your affection be fixed upon
  me. Forsake Rāma—fallen from his kingdom, his purpose unfulfilled, and of
  limited lifespan.”
'14': >-
  “By what virtues are you attached, O foolish woman who prides herself on
  wisdom, to him who, at a woman’s word, abandoned his kingdom along with his
  friends and well-wishers,”
'15': >-
  “and, of perverse understanding, dwells in this forest that is the haunt of
  serpents?”—Having spoken these words to Maithilī, who was worthy of love and
  gentle of speech,
'16': >-
  that rākṣasa, of exceedingly wicked soul and deluded by desire, approached and
  seized Sītā—like the wise (Moon) seizing Rohiṇī in the sky.
'17': >-
  With his left hand he grasped lotus-eyed Sītā by the hair upon her head; and
  with his right hand he seized her by the thighs.
'18': >-
  Seeing him—like a mountain peak—terrible with sharp fangs and mighty-armed,
  the woodland deities, tormented by fear, fled away, as though Death himself
  had appeared.
'19': >-
  Then there appeared his wondrous and divine great chariot, yoked with asses,
  resounding with the braying of asses, and gleaming with golden parts—Rāvaṇa’s
  chariot of a great warrior.
'20': >-
  Thereupon, with harsh words the loud-voiced one threatened her; then, lifting
  Vaidehī onto his lap, he set her upon the chariot.
'21': >-
  Thus seized by Rāvaṇa, the illustrious Sītā cried out piteously, distressed
  with grief, calling “Rāma! Rāma!” while Rāma had gone far away into the
  forest.
'22': >-
  Though she did not consent, that desire-tormented one carried her off—like the
  bride of the king of serpents—while she struggled; and then Rāvaṇa sprang up
  into the sky.
'23': >-
  Then, being borne away through the air by the lord of the rākṣasas, she cried
  out loudly, like one maddened—her mind reeling, as an afflicted person might.
'24': >-
  “O Lakṣmaṇa, mighty-armed, you who gladden the heart of your venerable elders!
  Do you not know that I am being carried off by a shape-shifting rākṣasa?”
'25': >-
  “O Rāghava, though you have abandoned life itself, happiness, and wealth for
  the sake of dharma—why do you not see me being carried away unrighteously?”
'26': >-
  “Surely you are the chastiser of the undisciplined, O scorcher of foes; how is
  it that you do not restrain and punish this sinful Rāvaṇa, such as he is?”
'27': >-
  “The fruit of an undisciplined person’s deed is not seen immediately; here
  even Time becomes a factor—like the ripening of crops.”
'28': >-
  “You have done this deed with your mind blinded by Time; now meet with
  dreadful calamity from Rāma—calamity that brings life to its end.”
'29': >-
  “Now indeed Kaikeyī, together with her kinsmen, will have her desire
  fulfilled: that I, the famed lawful wife of Rāma, who is devoted to dharma, am
  being carried away.”
'30': >-
  “I call upon the blossoming karnikāra trees of Janasthāna: swiftly report to
  Rāma—‘Rāvaṇa is carrying Sītā away!’”
'31': >-
  “I bow to the Godāvarī River, filled with the cries of flocks of swans and
  cranes. Swiftly inform Rāma—‘Rāvaṇa is carrying Sītā away!’”
'32': >-
  “And whatever deities there are in this forest, abiding in trees of many
  kinds—I bow to them all. Tell my lord that I have been taken away.”
'33': >-
  “And whatever living beings of various kinds are here—indeed all the herds of
  deer and hosts of birds—I take refuge in you all.”
'34': >-
  “Declare: ‘Sītā has been carried off, helplessly, by Rāvaṇa’—Sītā who is dear
  to her husband, more precious even than his very life-breath.”
'35': >-
  “Knowing this, that mighty-armed one, of great strength, will bring me back by
  his valor—even if I had been taken by Vaivasvata (Yama, Lord of Death)
  himself.”
'36': >-
  Then, exceedingly sorrowful, lamenting with words full of compassion,
  she—large-eyed—saw a vulture perched upon a tree.
'37': >-
  Beholding him, that fair-hipped lady, fallen under Rāvaṇa’s control, cried out
  in terror, her voice broken by grief.
'38': >-
  “O noble Jaṭāyu, look upon me—carried off like one without protection—by this
  lord of rākṣasas, pitiless and of sinful deeds!”
'39': >-
  “This cruel night-ranger cannot be stopped by you; he is possessed of
  strength, intent upon what he desires, and armed besides—of wicked
  understanding.”
'40': >-
  “But, Jaṭāyu, you must relate to Rāma truthfully the abduction of me, and to
  Lakṣmaṇa also—you must declare all of it, without remainder.”
'41': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the
  forty-ninth sarga, entitled “The Abduction of Sītā.”
