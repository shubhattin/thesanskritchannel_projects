  Now begins the one-hundredth canto, named “The Expedition for the Conquest of
  the Gandharva Country,” in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa.
'1': >-
  Then, after some time had passed, Yudhājit, the king of Kekaya, sent to the
  high-souled Rāghava his own preceptor—Gārgya, the son of Aṅgiras, a brahmarṣi
  of immeasurable splendour.
'2': He also sent, as an unsurpassed gift born of affection, ten thousand horses.
'3': >-
  And the king bestowed upon Rāma blankets, jewels, excellent variegated
  garments, and auspicious ornaments as well.
'4': >-
  But the wise Rāghava, hearing that the great sage Gārgya had arrived, and that
  those great riches had been sent by his maternal uncle, the lord of horses,
'5': >-
  went forth to meet him, O son of Kakutstha, for a full krośa, together with
  his younger brothers, and honoured Gārgya just as Śakra honours Bṛhaspati.
'6': >-
  Having thus duly worshipped that ṛṣi, and having accepted that wealth, and
  having inquired step by step about every welfare and well-being of his
  maternal uncle, Rāma then began to question that highly fortunate one as he
  sat down.
'7': >-
  “What message has my maternal uncle spoken? For what purpose has this
  venerable one come here—this best among the skilled in speech, like Bṛhaspati
  himself in visible form?”
'8': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, the great sage began to relate to Rāghava, in full
  extent, the matter at hand—marvellous in appearance and import.
'9': >-
  “Your maternal uncle, O mighty-armed one, that bull among men, Yudhājit, has
  spoken a message joined with affection; hear it, if it pleases you.
'10': >-
  On both banks of the Sindhu there is a region, exceedingly beautiful, adorned
  with fruits and roots—this is the land of the Gandharvas.
'11': >-
  That land is guarded by Gandharvas, armed and skilled in battle—O hero—three
  crores in number, sons of Śailūṣa, possessed of great strength.
'12': >-
  Conquer them, O Kakutstha, and then, O mighty-armed one, establish the fair
  city of the Gandharvas as a settlement, well-secured, as your own.
'13': >-
  No other has any access there; the country is supremely beautiful. Let it
  please you, O mighty-armed one—for I do not speak what is not for your good.”
'14': >-
  Hearing that, Rāghava was pleased—both with the great sage and with his
  maternal uncle—and he said, “So be it,” and then looked toward Bharata.
'15': >-
  Then the delighted Rāghava, with hands joined in reverence, spoke to the
  brāhmaṇa: “O brahmarṣi, these two princes shall go forth to that country.
'16': >-
  They are Bharata’s heroic sons—Takṣa and Puṣkala—well protected by their
  maternal uncle, and firmly established in dharma.
'17': >-
  Placing Bharata at their head, those two princes, accompanied by forces, shall
  slay the sons of the Gandharvas and shall divide the two cities between them.
'18': >-
  And having established them in those excellent cities—having settled my own
  sons there—Bharata, most righteous, will return again to my presence.”
'19': >-
  Having thus addressed the brahmarṣi, Rāma then commanded Bharata, together
  with his followers and forces; and he consecrated the two princes.
'20': >-
  And, having chosen an auspicious constellation, and placing in front the son
  of Aṅgiras, Bharata set out with the army, along with the two princes.
'21': >-
  That army then marched out from the city as though attended by Śakra
  himself—following the Rāghavas—far-reaching and difficult to assail even for
  the gods.
'22': >-
  Flesh-eating beings and very mighty rākṣasas followed after Bharata as well,
  out of thirst for blood.
'23': >-
  And many hordes of goblins—flesh-eaters, exceedingly dreadful—followed in
  thousands, desiring to feed upon the flesh of the Gandharva sons.
'24': >-
  And many thousands of lions, tigers, and boars, and also winged creatures and
  birds that move in the sky, went ahead of the army.
'25': >-
  After staying on the road for a month and a half, the army, free from
  sickness—filled with joyful and well-nourished men—reached Kekaya.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundredth canto, named “The Expedition for the Conquest of
  the Gandharva Country,” in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primordial epic.
