  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, is the forty-fourth
  sarga, entitled “The Summoning of Lakṣmaṇa and the Others.”
'1': >-
  Having dismissed the circle of his friends, Rāghava—his resolve fixed by
  deliberate thought—spoke these words to the doorkeeper who was seated nearby:
'2': >-
  “Swiftly bring Sāumitrī—Lakṣmaṇa of auspicious marks—also the greatly
  fortunate Bharata, and Śatrughna, unconquered in battle.”
'3': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s command, the doorkeeper, with joined palms placed upon his
  head, went to Lakṣmaṇa’s house and entered it without obstruction.
'4': >-
  With folded hands he addressed that great-souled prince with words of
  reverence: “The king desires to see you. Go there; do not delay.”
'5': >-
  “So be it,” said Sāumitrī. Having heard Rāghava’s injunction, he hurried
  forth, mounted his chariot, and sped toward Rāghava’s residence.
'6': >-
  Seeing Lakṣmaṇa depart, the doorkeeper then approached Bharata and, with
  joined palms, spoke to him there with due respect:
'7': >-
  “Bowing in humility, know this: the king wishes to see you.” Hearing the words
  spoken by the doorkeeper on Rāma’s behalf, Bharata—
'8': >-
  the mighty one—sprang up at once from his seat and went on foot. Seeing
  Bharata setting out, the doorkeeper, hastening with folded hands,
'9': >-
  went then to Śatrughna’s dwelling and said to him: “Come, come forth, O best
  of the Raghu line; the king desires to see you.”
'10': >-
  “For Lakṣmaṇa has already gone ahead, and the greatly renowned Bharata as
  well.” Hearing his message, Śatrughna rose at once from his highest seat,
'11': >-
  touched his head to the earth, and proceeded to where Rāghava was. Then the
  doorkeeper returned to Rāma and, with joined palms, reported that all his own
  brothers had arrived and were in attendance.
'12': >-
  On hearing that the princes had come, the Lord of men—his senses agitated by
  anxiety—bowed his face down, his mind dejected, and spoke to the doorkeeper:
'13': >-
  “Bring the princes into my presence at once, with haste. In them is my very
  life; they are my breaths, dear to me.”
'14': >-
  Thus commanded by the king, those princes, radiant like Indra, entered—bowed
  low, hands joined in reverence, and composed in mind.
'15': >-
  But when they beheld his face—like the moon overcast with gloom, like the sun
  at twilight bereft of its splendour—
'16': >-
  and when they saw the wise Rāma’s eyes filled with tears, and his countenance,
  like a lotus whose beauty has been struck down, they—
'17': >-
  quickly bowed in salutation, touching with their heads Rāma’s feet, and stood
  there, all self-controlled; while Rāma, for his part, let his tears flow.
'18': >-
  Then the mighty-armed one embraced them with both arms, raised them up, and
  saying, “Be seated on the seats,” thereafter spoke these words:
'19': >-
  “You are my all; you are my very life. It is with you as my support that I
  protect this kingdom, O lords among men.”
'20': >-
  “You have mastered the purport of the śāstras and are firmly established in
  understanding. Therefore, assembling together, this task of mine must be
  investigated by you, O lords among men.”
'21': >-
  As the son of Kakutstha spoke thus, all of them—intent on attentive
  listening—were troubled at heart, thinking, ‘What indeed will the king say?’
'22': >-
  Thus ends the forty-fourth sarga in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Summoning of Lakṣmaṇa and the Others.”
