  Now begins the ninety-fourth canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Description of Citrakūṭa.”
'1': >-
  Having dwelt for a long time upon that mountain—Rāma, who was fond of
  mountains and forests—desiring what would be pleasing to Vaidehī (Sītā) and
  also seeking to delight his own heart, (spoke to her).
'2': >-
  Then the son of Daśaratha showed that wondrous Citrakūṭa (to Sītā)—he whose
  splendor was like that of the Immortals—just as Purandara (Indra) shows
  (heavenly sights) to Śacī, his wife.
'3': >-
  “O fair one, it is not my falling away from kingship, nor is it separation
  from friends, that pains my mind; rather, on seeing this delightful mountain,
  my heart is troubled (with tender emotion).”
'4': >-
  “Behold this mountain, O auspicious lady—thronged with hosts of birds of many
  kinds—adorned with mineral ores, with peaks that seem to pierce the sky as
  though lifted up into it.”
'5': >-
  “Some (parts) appear like silver; some are like the hue of blood; some are
  yellow, the color of mañjiṣṭhā (madder); and some shine with the radiance of
  excellent gems.”
'6': >-
  “Some resemble blossoms, the sun, and ketaka flowers; some have the luster of
  liquid light (as it were). Thus do the regions of this lord of mountains
  shine, beautified by minerals.”
'7': >-
  “Surrounded by herds of many kinds of deer, by leopards, bears, and troops of
  monkeys, this mountain—harmless (in its creatures) and filled with multitudes
  of birds—shines exceedingly.”
'8': >-
  “It is full of mango and jambu trees, sanas, lodhra, priyāla, jackfruit, and
  dhava; with aṅkola trees, lovely atiniśa, and also bilva, tinduka, and
  bamboo.”
'9': >-
  “With kāśmarya, ariṣṭa, and varuṇa; with madhūka and tilaka as well; with
  badarī (jujube), āmalaka (emblic myrobalan), nīpa, and with vetra, dhanvana,
  and bījaka trees.”
'10': >-
  “Bearing flowers and laden with fruits, providing shade, charming to the
  mind—filled with these and such other trees—this mountain increases in
  splendor.”
'11': >-
  “On these lovely mountain slopes, behold, O fair lady, the hair-raising
  (wondrous) sights—Kinnaras in pairs, high-souled beings, sporting in delight.”
'12': >-
  “And behold the swords hanging upon branches, and the finest garments; and
  also the delightful playground-grounds of the wives of the Vidyādharas.”
'13': >-
  “With waterfalls, with bursting springs, and with streams flowing here and
  there, this mountain shines—like an elephant from whose temples rutting ichor
  streams.”
'14': >-
  “The breeze from the caves, carrying fragrances born of many kinds of flowers,
  comes and gratifies the nostrils—what man would it not gladden?”
'15': >-
  “If, O blameless one, I were to dwell here through many autumn seasons
  together with you and with Lakṣmaṇa, sorrow would not burn me.”
'16': >-
  “In this charming place rich in many flowers and fruits, thronged with hosts
  of varied birds, and having wondrous peaks, O passionate lady, I have grown
  deeply attached (to this mountain).”
'17': >-
  “By this forest-dwelling, I have obtained a twofold fruit: freedom from debt
  to my father in the matter of righteousness, and likewise what is dear to
  Bharata.”
'18': >-
  “O Vaidehī, do you indeed take delight with me on Citrakūṭa—beholding diverse
  conditions and scenes—while restraining mind, speech, and body?”
'19': >-
  “This alone the former royal seers declared to be nectar: forest-dwelling for
  one’s welfare; and after death, my forefathers (too) have spoken thus to me.”
'20': >-
  “The rocks of the mountain are splendid—hundreds of them all around—dense and
  abundant, with many hues: blue, yellow, white, and red.”
'21': >-
  “At night, on this lord of mountains, thousands of herbs shine—marked by their
  own radiance—like tongues of fire.”
'22': >-
  “Some regions look like a dark cloud; some resemble a garden; and some appear
  as single great slabs of stone, O lovely lady, upon this mountain.”
'23': >-
  “Citrakūṭa appears as though it has risen up by cleaving the earth; and that
  fair summit of Citrakūṭa is seen as auspicious on every side.”
'24': >-
  “See, (here) are the bedding-spreads of lovers—covered above with kuṣṭha,
  puṃnāga, and sthagāra, and with birch-leaves as upper coverings—piled with
  lotus-leaves.”
'25': >-
  “See, O lady, the garlands of lotuses—crushed and cast aside—visible here; and
  see also the various fruits (left behind) by lovers.”
'26': >-
  “This lotus-lake, as it were, surpasses even the northern Kurus in delight,
  being a resort of the gods; and this mountain, Citrakūṭa, abounds in many
  roots, fruits, and waters.”
'27': >-
  “But for this time, O woman, sporting here with you, Sītā, and with Lakṣmaṇa,
  I shall attain a joy that enhances the dharma of our lineage—standing upon the
  path of the virtuous, firmly established in my own excellent restraints (of
  conduct).”
'28': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-fourth canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “The Description of Citrakūṭa.”
