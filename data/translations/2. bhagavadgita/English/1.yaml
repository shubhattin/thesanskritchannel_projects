'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (the Supreme Lord).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': >-
  Now, the First Chapter: Arjuna’s Yoga of Despondency (the discipline arising
  from Arjuna’s sorrow).
'3': 'Dhṛtarāṣṭra said:'
'4': >-
  In the field of dharma, at Kurukṣetra, assembled and eager to fight—what did
  my sons and the sons of Pāṇḍu do, O Sañjaya?
'5': 'Sañjaya said:'
'6': >-
  Then King Duryodhana, seeing the army of the Pāṇḍavas drawn up in battle
  array, approached his teacher and spoke these words:
'7': >-
  Behold, O Teacher, this mighty army of the sons of Pāṇḍu, arranged in
  formation by the son of Drupada—your wise disciple.
'8': >-
  Here are heroic bowmen and great chariot-warriors, equal in battle to Bhīma
  and Arjuna: Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki), and Virāṭa, and Drupada, the great
  chariot-warrior.
'9': >-
  Dhṛṣṭaketu, Cekitāna, and the valiant king of Kāśī; also Purujit, Kuntibhoja,
  and Śaibya—the best among men.
'10': >-
  And the powerful Yudhāmanyu, and the valiant Uttamaujā; the son of Subhadrā
  (Abhimanyu), and the sons of Draupadī—all indeed great chariot-warriors.
'11': >-
  But those who are foremost on our side—know them, O best of twice-born; the
  leaders of my army, I name to you for your recognition.
'12': >-
  You yourself, and Bhīṣma, and Karṇa, and Kṛpa, the victor in battle;
  Aśvatthāmā, Vikarṇa, and also the son of Somadatta (Bhūriśravā).
'13': >-
  And many other heroes as well, who for my sake have renounced their very
  lives—armed with various weapons and missiles, all skilled in warfare.
'14': >-
  This strength of ours, guarded by Bhīṣma, is insufficient; but the strength of
  theirs, guarded by Bhīma, is sufficient.
'15': >-
  Therefore, stationed in your respective positions in all the divisions, all of
  you indeed protect Bhīṣma alone (on every side).
'16': >-
  Then the mighty grandsire, the aged elder of the Kurus, to raise his
  (Duryodhana’s) spirits, roared aloud like a lion and blew his conch.
'17': >-
  Thereupon, conches and kettledrums, tabors, drums, and horns were sounded all
  at once; and that tumultuous sound arose.
'18': >-
  Then, stationed in their great chariot yoked with white horses, Mādhava
  (Kṛṣṇa) and the son of Pāṇḍu (Arjuna) blew their divine conches.
'19': >-
  Hṛṣīkeśa (Kṛṣṇa) blew the Pāñcajanya; Dhanañjaya (Arjuna) blew the Devadatta;
  and Vṛkodara (Bhīma), of mighty deeds, blew the great conch Pauṇḍra.
'20': >-
  King Yudhiṣṭhira, the son of Kuntī, blew the Anantavijaya; and Nakula and
  Sahadeva (blew) the Sughoṣa and the Maṇipuṣpaka.
'21': >-
  And the king of Kāśī, the supreme archer; and Śikhaṇḍī, the great
  chariot-warrior; Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Virāṭa; and the unconquered Sātyaki,
'22': >-
  Drupada, and the sons of Draupadī, O lord of the earth; and the mighty-armed
  son of Subhadrā—each blew his conch separately.
'23': >-
  That roar tore the hearts of Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s sons, reverberating with tumult
  through sky and earth alike.
'24': >-
  Then the son of Pāṇḍu, whose banner bore the emblem of Hanumān, seeing
  Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s sons drawn up, and as the showering of weapons was about to
  begin, lifted his bow.
'25': >-
  Then, O king, he spoke these words to Hṛṣīkeśa (Kṛṣṇa). Arjuna said: Place my
  chariot between the two armies, O Acyuta,
'26': >-
  so that I may behold those who stand here eager to fight, and know with whom I
  must battle in this great endeavor of war.
'27': >-
  I wish to look upon those assembled here for battle—desiring to do what is
  pleasing in war to the evil-minded son of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
'28': 'Sañjaya said:'
'29': >-
  Thus addressed by Guḍākeśa (Arjuna), Hṛṣīkeśa (Kṛṣṇa), O Bhārata, placed the
  excellent chariot between the two armies,
'30': >-
  in front of Bhīṣma and Droṇa, and before all the rulers of the earth, and
  said: O Pārtha, behold these Kurus assembled here.
'31': >-
  There Pārtha beheld stationed in both armies: fathers and grandfathers,
  teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, and friends as well;
'32': >-
  fathers-in-law and well-wishers too, on both sides. Seeing all those kinsmen
  standing thus, the son of Kuntī,
'33': >-
  overwhelmed by deepest compassion, sank into grief and spoke these words.
  Arjuna said: O Kṛṣṇa, seeing this my own people arrayed, eager to fight,
'34': >-
  my limbs fail, my mouth becomes parched; my body trembles, and my hair stands
  on end.
'35': >-
  Gāṇḍīva slips from my hand, and my skin burns; I am unable to stand, and my
  mind seems to whirl.
'36': >-
  And I see omens that are adverse, O Keśava; nor do I foresee any good in
  slaying my own people in battle.
'37': >-
  I do not desire victory, O Kṛṣṇa, nor kingdom, nor pleasures. Of what use to
  us is a kingdom, O Govinda? Of what use are enjoyments—or even life?
'38': >-
  Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures—those very
  persons stand here in battle, having renounced life and wealth.
'39': >-
  Teachers, fathers, sons, and likewise grandfathers; maternal uncles,
  fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives—
'40': >-
  these I do not wish to kill, O Madhusūdana, even if they kill me— not even for
  the sake of sovereignty over the three worlds, how much less for the sake of
  this earth!
'41': >-
  Having slain the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, what joy could be ours, O Janārdana?
  Only sin would cling to us, having killed these aggressors.
'42': >-
  Therefore we ought not to kill the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, our own kinsmen; for
  how, having slain our own people, could we be happy, O Mādhava?
'43': >-
  Though these, with minds overpowered by greed, do not perceive the fault in
  the destruction of a family, nor the sin in betrayal of friends,
'44': >-
  how should we not understand to turn away from this sin, O Janārdana— we who
  clearly see the evil arising from the destruction of a family?
'45': >-
  With the destruction of a family, its eternal family-dharmas perish; and when
  dharma is destroyed, adharma overcomes the whole family.
'46': >-
  From the triumph of adharma, O Kṛṣṇa, the women of the family become
  corrupted; and when the women are corrupted, O Vārṣṇeya, there arises
  intermixture of varṇas (varṇa-saṅkara).
'47': >-
  Such intermixture leads to hell for the destroyers of the family and for the
  family as well; for their forefathers fall, deprived of offerings of
  rice-balls and water (the rites of piṇḍa and udaka).
'48': >-
  By these faults of the destroyers of a family—producing varṇa-saṅkara— the
  eternal duties of caste and of family are brought to ruin.
'49': >-
  We have heard, O Janārdana, that for men whose family-dharmas are destroyed,
  residence in hell is indeed certain.
'50': >-
  Alas! We are resolved to commit a great sin, in that from greed for the
  pleasures of kingdom we are prepared to slay our own people.
'51': >-
  If, in battle, the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, weapons in hand, should slay me
  unresisting and unarmed, that would be more auspicious for me.
'52': 'Sañjaya said:'
'53': >-
  Having spoken thus on the battlefield, Arjuna sat down on the seat of the
  chariot, casting aside his bow along with the arrows, his mind distressed with
  sorrow.
'54': >-
  Om—That is the Truth. Thus, in the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, among the Upaniṣads,
  in the knowledge of Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue between
  Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, ends the First Chapter, entitled “Arjuna’s Yoga of
  Despondency.”
