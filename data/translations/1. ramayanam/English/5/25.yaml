  Now begins, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa, the
  twenty-fifth canto, called “Sītā’s Despondency.”
'1': >-
  While those ill-favoured rākṣasī-women were speaking many harsh and dreadful
  words, Janaka’s daughter burst into tears.
'2': >-
  Thus addressed by the rākṣasīs, the high-minded daughter of Videha spoke,
  exceedingly terrified, with a voice choked and broken by tears:
'3': >-
  A human woman is not fit to become the wife of a rākṣasa. Even if you all
  wish, devour me—yet I shall not do as you bid.
'4': >-
  Sītā, in the midst of the rākṣasīs, resembling a daughter of the gods, found
  no comfort, tormented by grief, as though censured by Rāvaṇa himself.
'5': >-
  Sītā trembled all the more, as if her very limbs were being entered and
  pierced; like a doe in the forest, separated from her herd, harried by
  jackals.
'6': >-
  Then, clasping a broad, blossoming branch of the aśoka tree, she pondered with
  grief upon her lord, her spirit broken.
'7': >-
  Bathing her full breasts with the stream of tears from her eyes, she
  reflected, yet could not reach the end of her sorrow then.
'8': >-
  Trembling, she sank down like a plantain tree bent and felled by the wind;
  terrified of the rākṣasīs, her face grew pallid.
'9': >-
  And then, as Sītā trembled, her long and thick braid was seen quivering and
  moving, like a female serpent gliding along.
'10': >-
  Sighing deeply, afflicted with grief, her mind struck and shaken by anger, the
  distressed daughter of Mithilā let fall tears and lamented.
'11': >-
  “Alas, Rāma!”—so she cried in anguish; “alas again, Lakṣmaṇa!” And, “alas, my
  mother-in-law Kauśalyā! Alas, Sumitrā!” thus wailed that noble lady.
'12': >-
  “This saying, proclaimed by the wise and spoken as truth among men, proves
  true indeed: untimely death is hard to obtain—whether for woman or for man.
'13': >-
  Here I am, harassed by these cruel rākṣasīs; bereft of Rāma, I live, pained
  even for a single moment.
'14': >-
  “I—of little merit, wretched—shall perish like one without refuge, like a
  laden boat in mid-ocean driven about by the force of the winds.
'15': >-
  “Not beholding my husband, fallen under the power of rākṣasīs, I truly sink
  down with grief, like a river-bank washed away by water.
'16': >-
  “Blessed indeed are those who behold my lord—lotus-petal-leaved eyes,
  lion-like in the majesty of his stride—grateful, and gentle in speech.
'17': >-
  “In every way bereft of him—Rāma of known and steadfast self—my life is hard
  to bear, like having tasted a sharp poison.
'18': >-
  “What great sin, truly, did I commit in some former body, by which this
  dreadful and exceedingly cruel great sorrow has come upon me?
'19': >-
  “Encompassed by mighty grief, I wish to abandon life; and guarded by these
  rākṣasīs, I am unable to reach Rāma.
'20': >-
  “Fie upon human birth! Fie upon dependence on another’s will!—since it is not
  possible to renounce life according to one’s own desire.”
'21': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fifth canto of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the First Poem, called “Sītā’s Despondency.”
