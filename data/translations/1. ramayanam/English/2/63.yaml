  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, the sixty-third
  canto, called “The Episode of the Slaying of the Hermit’s Son.”
'1': >-
  Then King Daśaratha, again and again roused by that (recollection), his
  consciousness struck down by grief, entered upon deep and anxious thought.
'2': >-
  From the exile of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, a calamity, dark as an asura, descended
  upon him—like thick gloom falling upon the sun, though he was like Indra among
  kings.
'3': >-
  When Rāma, together with his wife, had departed, the lord of Kośala—desiring
  to speak to Kauśalyā of dark-eyed beauty, and recalling his own evil deed—(was
  inwardly tormented).
'4': >-
  On the sixth night after Rāma had gone forth to the forest, Daśaratha, in the
  middle of the night, remembering the sin he had committed, (lay wakeful).
'5': >-
  That king, tormented by sorrow for his son, remembering his own evil deed,
  spoke these words to Kauśalyā, who herself was distressed with grief for her
  son:
'6': >-
  “Whatever a doer does, O auspicious lady—be it good or be it evil—that indeed
  he obtains, O noble one, as the fruit born of his own action.”
'7': >-
  “He who does not understand, at the very outset of undertakings, the weight or
  lightness of their consequences—the outcome of actions, whether faulty or
  not—is said to be but a child.”
'8': >-
  “Someone, having cut down a mango-grove, waters a forest of palāśa trees;
  seeing blossoms and craving fruit, he grieves when the season of fruit
  arrives.”
'9': >-
  “He who, without knowing the fruit (that will follow), runs after mere
  action—he will lament when the time of fruit has come, like one who waters the
  kiṃśuka.”
'10': >-
  “So too I—having cut down the mango-grove, I watered the palāśa; having cast
  away Rāma when the time of fruit has come, I now lament afterwards, being of
  wretched understanding.”
'11': >-
  “Because I had attained fame, O Kauśalyā, as a prince skilled with the
  bow—known as ‘one who strikes by sound’—this sin was committed by me.”
'12': >-
  “This sorrow, O queen, has now come upon me—wrought by my own hand—like poison
  that is eaten by a foolish child through delusion.”
'13': >-
  “As some other man might be deluded by palāśa blossoms, so was I too unaware
  of the consequence of that ‘sound-aiming’ (skill).”
'14': >-
  “You, O lady, were newly wed, and I was a young prince; then the rainy season
  arrived, increasing the desires that stirred within me.”
'15': >-
  “Having drawn up the earthly waters and scorched (all) with his rays, the sun,
  dreadful in his might, enters the western quarter—as if following the fixed
  course of those who have passed away.”
'16': >-
  “The heat was at once hidden away; cool, unctuous clouds appeared; then all
  creatures rejoiced—frogs, sāraṅga birds, and peacocks.”
'17': >-
  “Birds—soaked in their wings, as if bathed, and distressed—repaired to trees
  whose tops were shaken by wind and rain.”
'18': >-
  “The intoxicated sāraṅga, covered by the water that fell and fell repeatedly,
  shone like a mountain mass of water—immovable.”
'19': >-
  “Even clear streams, pale and reddish in hue, flowed from the minerals of the
  mountains, bearing ashes, like serpents.”
'20': >-
  “At the coming of the clouds, even clear streams, their waters disturbed and
  reddened, became carriers of waters gone out of their course.”
'21': >-
  “In that season of exceeding delight, I—bowman, archer, and
  charioteer—resolving upon exercise, followed the river Sarayū.”
'22': >-
  “With senses uncontrolled, desiring to slay, at night, a buffalo or an
  elephant that might come down to the river for drinking—or some other wild
  beast—(I lay in wait).”
'23': >-
  “There, in that place, alone at night, my bow unstrung and ready, I waited for
  some wild creature that might come to the bank.”
'24': >-
  “And then, hearing a sound, (thinking) some other fierce deer had come; in the
  darkness I heard, in the water, the sound of a pitcher being filled.”
'25': >-
  “In the range of my sightless (night-blinded) vision, the noise was like that
  of an elephant trumpeting; then I drew an arrow, blazing, like a serpent’s
  venom.”
'26': >-
  “Aiming at the sound, eager for an elephant, I let it fly; I discharged that
  sharp arrow, like venom, toward the sound.”
'27': >-
  “Then, at dawn, a voice became clearly heard—of a forest-dweller—crying ‘Hā!
  Hā!’ as he fell into the water, his vital spot struck by the arrow.”
'28': >-
  “When that arrow had fallen, there arose there a human voice: ‘How can a
  weapon fall upon one like me, a female ascetic?’”
'29': >-
  “‘I have come by night to this lonely river to draw water; by whom have I been
  struck with an arrow? And to whom, or what, have I done wrong?’”
'30': >-
  “‘For a sage who has laid aside the staff (of punishment), dwelling in the
  forest and living on what is found there—how can such a one as I be slain by a
  weapon?’”
'31': >-
  “‘Bearing the burden of matted locks, clad in bark and antelope-skin—who could
  desire my death? Or what harm have I done to him?’”
'32': >-
  “‘Thus, begun to no purpose and tending only to mischief—no good man would
  approve it—like the act of one who violates the guru’s bed.’”
'33': >-
  “‘I do not grieve so much for the ending of my own life; rather I grieve for
  my mother and father, both of them, who are like me (helpless).’”
'34': >-
  “‘That aged pair, long maintained by me—when I have reached the state of five
  elements (death), what livelihood will they carry on?’”
'35': >-
  “‘My parents are old and blind, and I alone have been slain by one arrow; by
  whom, indeed, have all of us been struck down—by some foolish child lacking
  self-control?’”
'36': >-
  “Hearing that pitiable speech, and desiring to act in accordance with dharma,
  my bow with the arrow slipped from my hands and fell to the ground, as I was
  shaken.”
'37': >-
  “Hearing his lamentation at night—much and piteous—I, confounded by the rush
  of grief, became utterly senseless for a long while.”
'38': >-
  “Coming to that place, my spirit crushed and my mind deeply distressed, I saw
  on the bank of the Sarayū an ascetic youth slain by my arrow.”
'39': >-
  “His matted hair fallen loose, his water-pot’s water spilled out, his limbs
  smeared with mud and blood—lying down, tormented by the embedded shaft.”
'40': >-
  “Seeing me with his eyes—(I being) frightened, my mind unsteady—he spoke these
  harsh words, as though he would burn me with his radiance:
'41': >-
  “‘What harm have I done to you, O king, dwelling in the forest, that I—seeking
  water for my preceptor—have been struck by you?’”
'42': >-
  “‘With a single arrow, as I am struck in a vital part, two blind old people
  have been slain—my mother and my father.’”
'43': >-
  “‘Surely those two—weak and blind—waiting for me and parched with thirst, will
  long endure that hard thirst, having placed their hope (in me).’”
'44': >-
  “‘Surely there is no fruit of austerity, nor any power of sacred
  learning—since my father does not know that I lie fallen on the earth.’”
'45': >-
  “‘And even if he knew, what could he do—powerless, without the ability to
  move? Like one mountain unable to save another that is being split.’”
'46': >-
  “‘You yourself must go at once and tell my father, O Rāghava; lest, enraged,
  he burn you—like a blazing fire consuming a forest.’”
'47': >-
  “‘This is the one-footed path, O king, by which lies my father’s hermitage; go
  and appease him, so that, angered, he may not curse you.’”
'48': >-
  “‘Draw out the arrow from me, O king; the sharp shaft is fixed in my vital
  spot—blocking the swelling of life, as a river-bank is held back by the rush
  of waters.’”
'49': >-
  “‘With the arrow within, a man struggles for breath; once the arrow is drawn
  out, he perishes.’ Thus anxiety entered me concerning the extraction of his
  shaft.
'50': >-
  “Then the hermit’s son perceived in my heart that anxiety—(I being) sorrowful
  and wretched, afflicted with grief and anguish.”
'51': >-
  “Wasting away in that sorrow, he spoke to me with utmost distress—his limbs
  slackening, writhing, and nearing his end:
'52': >-
  “‘Steadying myself with fortitude, I shall become of firm mind. Let the sin
  that comes from brahma-slaughter be removed from your heart.’”
'53': >-
  “‘I am not twice-born, O king; let there be no pain in your mind. I am born of
  a Vaiśya by a Śūdra woman, O ruler of the realm.’”
'54': >-
  “As he spoke thus with difficulty—his vital spot pierced by the
  arrow—trembling, reeling, and convulsing, he shook upon the ground.
'55': “Then, as he bent down (in weakness), I drew out that arrow from him.
'56': >-
  “Lamenting grievously over him—his body wet with water, his vital wound
  continuously welling up—I then, O noble lady, looked upon him lying on the
  Sarayū’s bank, and became deeply despondent.
'57': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-third canto in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “The Episode of the Slaying of the
  Hermit’s Son.”
