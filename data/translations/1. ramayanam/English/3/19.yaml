  Now begins the nineteenth sarga (chapter), named “Khara’s Wrath,” in the
  Aranya Kanda of the glorious Valmiki Ramayana (the sacred epic composed by
  Valmiki).
'1': >-
  Seeing her thus fallen, disfigured, and drenched in blood, Khara the
  rakshasa—his heart scorched with anger for his sister—questioned her.
'2': >-
  “Rise up now; tell me! Cast off this swoon and abandon your confusion. Speak
  clearly—by whom have you been made thus, disfigured into this dreadful state?”
'3': >-
  “Who is he that, as though in play with only the tip of a finger, would strike
  at a black serpent seated still—an extremely venomous, sinless naga—when it
  has been provoked and has come close?”
'4': >-
  “One who, having fastened the noose of Death about his own neck, does not
  understand it through delusion—such a one has approached you today and, as it
  were, drunk the most potent poison!”
'5': >-
  “You are endowed with strength and valor, able to go as you wish, and capable
  of assuming forms at will—by whom were you brought to this condition, as
  though you had come into the very grasp of Antaka (Death)?”
'6': >-
  “Among devas, gandharvas, bhutas, and the great-souled rishis, who is this man
  of such mighty energy, who has made you so disfigured?”
'7': >-
  “For I do not see anyone in the world who would do what is displeasing to
  me—(not even) among the immortals, Indra of a thousand eyes, great lord of
  heaven, the chastiser of Paka.”
'8': >-
  “Today, with arrows that bring life to its end, I shall take away his
  breath—like a sarasa bird drinking dry milk that has mingled with water.”
'9': >-
  “When he is slain by me in battle, his vital spots cut by arrows—whose shall
  be that foaming blood which the earth will long to drink?”
'10': >-
  “From whose body will the winged vultures gather, tearing out flesh, and,
  delighted, devour it—when he is slain by me in war?”
'11': >-
  “Neither devas, nor gandharvas, nor pishachas, nor rakshasas will be able, in
  the great combat, to save that wretched one whom I have dragged into my
  power.”
'12': >-
  “As you slowly regain consciousness, you ought to tell me about him—by which
  ill-disciplined one were you defeated in the forest after he displayed his
  prowess?”
'13': >-
  Hearing the words of her brother—angry, and especially inflamed with
  rage—Surpanakha then spoke these words, choked with tears.
'14': >-
  “There are two youths, possessed of beauty, tender in form yet exceedingly
  strong—lotus-eyed with large wide eyes—clad in bark garments and black
  antelope-skins.”
'15': >-
  “Living on fruits and roots, self-controlled, and restrained—ascetics
  observing brahmacharya—they are the two sons of Dasharatha, the brothers Rama
  and Lakshmana.”
'16': >-
  “Resembling the king of gandharvas, endowed with the marks and bearing of
  royalty—whether they are gods or daityas, I do not dare to determine.”
'17': >-
  “There I saw a woman, youthful and beautiful, adorned with every ornament,
  slender-waisted, seated between the two.”
'18': >-
  “Both of them together, taking that woman as their cause, brought me to this
  condition—like an unprotected woman of loose conduct brought to ruin.”
'19': >-
  “And as for her—of crooked conduct—and as for those two when slain: I desire
  to drink their foaming blood upon the very forefront of the battlefield.”
'20': >-
  “This is my first desire; let it be accomplished there by you. In the great
  fight I would drink the blood of her and of those two.”
'21': >-
  As she spoke thus, Khara—wrathful—commanded fourteen mighty rakshasas, equal
  to Death in fury.
'22': >-
  “Two humans, furnished with weapons, clad in bark cloth and black
  antelope-skins, have entered the dreadful Dandaka forest with a woman.”
'23': >-
  “Slay those two and bring back that wicked woman. And this sister of mine
  shall drink their blood.”
'24': >-
  “This is the cherished wish of my sister. Go quickly and accomplish it—crush
  those two by your own fiery might.”
'25': >-
  “When you have seen those two brothers slain by you in battle, she—delighted
  and rejoicing—shall drink their blood in the fight.”
'26': >-
  Thus instructed in detail, those fourteen rakshasas went there together with
  her—like dense clouds driven by the wind.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the nineteenth sarga, named “Khara’s Wrath,” in the Aranya Kanda of
  the ancient, sacred, glorious Valmiki Ramayana, the Adi-Kavya (the first
  epic).
