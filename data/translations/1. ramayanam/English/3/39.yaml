  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  thirty-ninth chapter, called “The Refusal to Give Aid.”
'1': >-
  “Thus was I then, somehow, released by him in that battle. Now too, hear from
  me what further happened thereafter.”
'2': >-
  “Having thus been treated, and not yet sated, I—together with two rākṣasas,
  both assuming the forms of deer—entered the Daṇḍaka forest.”
'3': >-
  “A mighty wild beast, with tongue aflame, with huge fangs, with sharp-pointed
  horns, and of great strength, I ranged through the Daṇḍaka wilderness, feeding
  on flesh.”
'4': >-
  “At sacrifices of Agnihotra, at holy fords, and at sacred shrines and revered
  trees, O Rāvaṇa, I wandered about exceedingly dreadful, harassing those
  ascetics.”
'5': >-
  “Having slain in the Daṇḍaka forest those hermits who practiced righteousness,
  I drank their blood and ate their flesh.”
'6': >-
  “Cruel, feeding on the flesh of seers, terrifying the dwellers of the woods,
  then—intoxicated with blood—I roamed the Daṇḍaka forest.”
'7': >-
  “Thus roaming in the Daṇḍaka woods, a corrupter of dharma, I then encountered
  Rāma—an ascetic, established in righteousness.”
'8': >-
  “And Vaidehī of great fortune, and Lakṣmaṇa, the great chariot-warrior—Rāma,
  living as an ascetic, restrained in food, devoted to the welfare of all
  beings.”
'9': >-
  “I, having insulted that mighty Rāma in the forest, and knowing him to be an
  ascetic, yet remembering former enmity,”
'10': >-
  “I rushed upon him in great wrath—sharp-horned, in the form of a deer—desiring
  to slay him, my understanding perverted, recalling that blow.”
'11': >-
  “Then he discharged three arrows—keen, destroyers of enemies—drawing his very
  great bow; and they sped like Garuḍa, like the wind.”
'12': >-
  “Those arrows, like thunderbolts, most dreadful, blood-devouring, all three
  together came on, their joints bent and well-aimed.”
'13': >-
  “Knowing Rāma’s prowess, and crafty, having earlier seen fear, I sprang away
  and so was released; and those two rākṣasas were slain.”
'14': >-
  “Freed by an arrow of Rāma, somehow obtaining my life, I was driven forth to
  this place, living in discipline—an ascetic, self-controlled.”
'15': >-
  “On every tree, indeed, I seem to behold Rāma—clad in bark-garments and black
  antelope-skin, bow in hand—like Death himself holding a noose.”
'16': >-
  “Even a thousand Rāmas I see, in my fear, O Rāvaṇa; this entire forest appears
  to me as though it has become Rāma.”
'17': >-
  “I see only Rāma, even when he is not present, O lord of rākṣasas; and on
  seeing Rāma even in a dream, I go out of my senses, distraught.”
'18': >-
  “Names beginning with the sound ‘ra’—to me who am terrified of Rāma, O
  Rāvaṇa—as well as jewels and chariots, indeed, generate fear within me.”
'19': >-
  “I know his might: it is not fitting for you to wage war with him. The delight
  of the Raghu line would indeed slay even Bali or Namuci.”
'20': >-
  “Do battle in war with Rāma—or else make peace, O Rāvaṇa. Do not speak to me
  of Rāma, if you wish to look upon me.”
'21': >-
  “Many righteous men in the world, intent on the practice of dharma, have been
  ruined—together with their belongings—through the fault of others.”
'22': >-
  “I too, O night-wanderer, might perish through another’s offense. Do what
  seems proper to you; in truth, I shall not follow you.”
'23': >-
  “Rāma is of great radiance, of great spirit, of great strength; he could even
  become the destroyer of the very race of rākṣasas.”
'24': >-
  “If, because of Śūrpaṇakhā, Khara—gone to Janasthāna—committed outrageous acts
  and was formerly slain by Rāma of unwearied deeds, then tell here the truth as
  it really is: what transgression has Rāma committed?”
'25': >-
  “If you will not accept these words, spoken as they are by me for the sake of
  your kinsmen’s welfare, then you, together with your relatives, will abandon
  your life in battle—slain today by Rāma with straight-flying arrows.”
'26': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-ninth chapter, called “The Refusal to Give Aid,” in the
  Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
