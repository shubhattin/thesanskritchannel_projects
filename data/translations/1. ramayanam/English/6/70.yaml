  Now begins the Seventieth Canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Slaying of Devāntaka and Others.”
'1': >-
  Seeing Narāntaka slain, the foremost of the Rākṣasas cried aloud; and
  Devāntaka, and Trimūrdhā, and also Paulastya Mahodara, all came forth.
'2': >-
  Mahodara, mounted upon the lord of elephants that resembled a rain-cloud,
  rushed with great speed against Aṅgada, the mighty son of Vāli.
'3': >-
  Then Devāntaka, powerful and scorched with anguish for his brother’s calamity,
  took up a terrible iron mace and charged straight at Aṅgada.
'4': >-
  The hero Triśirā, mounting a chariot that shone like the sun and was yoked to
  excellent steeds, then advanced toward Vāli’s son.
'5': >-
  Assailed by those three Rākṣasa lords, slayers of the pride of the gods,
  Aṅgada tore up a huge tree with mighty branches.
'6': >-
  With all speed the valiant Aṅgada hurled that great, many-branched tree at
  Devāntaka, like Indra casting a blazing thunderbolt.
'7': >-
  But Triśirā cut it to pieces with arrows like venomous serpents; and seeing
  the tree severed, Aṅgada leapt up at once.
'8': >-
  Then that elephant among monkeys rained down trees and rocks; and the enraged
  Triśirā, with sharp arrows, cut them apart.
'9': >-
  With the head of his mace Mahodara shattered those trees, while Triśirā
  charged the heroic Aṅgada with a flight of shafts.
'10': >-
  Charging on his elephant, Mahodara, furious, struck Vāli’s son on the chest
  with javelins like thunderbolts.
'11': >-
  Devāntaka too, wrathful, approached and swiftly smote Aṅgada with his mace,
  then wheeled away with speed.
'12': >-
  Attacked all at once by those three foremost of the Rākṣasas, Vāli’s
  son—mighty in splendor and renowned for prowess—did not waver.
'13': >-
  That unconquerable one, swift, gathering tremendous momentum, charged and with
  his palm struck down Mahodara’s huge elephant.
'14': >-
  From that blow in battle, the elephant-king’s eyes fell out, and that great
  beast perished.
'15': >-
  Then Vāli’s son, of great strength, wrenching out the beast’s tusk, rushed at
  Devāntaka and beat him in the fight.
'16': >-
  Devāntaka, though radiant, reeled—like a tree shaken by the wind—and a great
  stream of blood, the color of lac-juice, poured forth.
'17': >-
  Thereafter the mighty, splendid Devāntaka, recovering with difficulty, whirled
  his mace with force and struck Aṅgada.
'18': >-
  Though struck by the mace, the son of the lord of monkeys fell to the earth
  upon his knees, yet sprang up again at once.
'19': >-
  As he was leaping up, Triśirā struck the terrible arrows, unerring, into the
  forehead of the son of the monkey-chief.
'20': >-
  When Aṅgada was thus surrounded by the three foremost Rākṣasas, Hanūmān and
  Nīla, understanding the danger, set forth.
'21': >-
  Then Nīla hurled a mountain-peak at Triśirā; but that wise son of Rāvaṇa split
  it with sharp arrows.
'22': >-
  Pierced by hundreds of arrows, its rocky surface shattered, that
  mountain-top—spraying sparks and blazing—fell down.
'23': >-
  Seeing that feat, the mighty Devāntaka, delighted, rushed with his mace
  against the son of the Wind-god in battle.
'24': >-
  As he came on, Hanūmān, that great elephant among monkeys, sprang up and
  struck him on the head with a fist like a thunderbolt.
'25': >-
  The mighty Vāyu’s son smote the hero upon the head, and with his roar that
  great monkey shook the Rākṣasas.
'26': >-
  Devāntaka—his skull crushed and split by the fist, his teeth and eyes
  extinguished, his tongue hanging down—son of the Rākṣasa king, fell suddenly
  to the earth, his life departed.
'27': >-
  When that foremost Rākṣasa warrior, of great strength, enemy of the gods, was
  slain in the battle, enraged Triśirā poured a dreadful shower of keen missiles
  upon Nīla’s chest.
'28': >-
  Mahodara, wrathful, again mounted swiftly upon an elephant like a mountain, as
  the Sun—lord of rays—ascends Mount Mandara.
'29': >-
  Then he caused a rain of arrows to fall upon Nīla, like a rain-cloud pouring
  on a mountain, with lightning and rainbow.
'30': >-
  Thus showered by torrents of arrows, the leader of the monkey host—his limbs
  torn—became slack-bodied and was held in check by that mighty one.
'31': >-
  But Nīla, regaining consciousness, tore up a mountain along with a mass of
  trees; then, springing up with tremendous and dreadful speed, he struck
  Mahodara on the head with it.
'32': >-
  Broken by the crash of that mountain, Mahodara—together with his huge
  elephant—fell bewildered upon the ground, his life gone, like a mountain
  struck by a thunderbolt.
'33': >-
  Seeing his uncle slain, Triśirā took up his bow; and, enraged, he pierced
  Hanūmān with sharp arrows.
'34': >-
  Then the son of the Wind, angered, hurled a mountain-peak; but the powerful
  Triśirā shattered it into many pieces with keen shafts.
'35': >-
  Seeing that peak rendered futile, the monkey then flung a rain of trees in
  that battle against Rāvaṇa’s son.
'36': >-
  As that shower of trees rushed through the sky, the valiant Triśirā cut it
  down with sharp arrows, and roared aloud.
'37': >-
  But Hanūmān sprang up, and in fury tore open Triśirā’s horse with his nails,
  like a lion rending a lordly elephant.
'38': >-
  Then Triśirā, son of Rāvaṇa, obtaining a spear like Death himself, like
  Kālārātri, hurled it at the son of the Wind.
'39': >-
  That spear, cast like a meteor flung from the heavens—hurled with deadly
  aim—Hanūmān, tiger among monkeys, seized, broke, and roared.
'40': >-
  Seeing that dreadful-looking spear shattered by Hanūmān, the monkey troops,
  rejoicing, raised a cry like thunder-clouds.
'41': >-
  Then Triśirā, foremost among Rākṣasas, lifting a sword, drove that blade into
  the chest of the lord of monkeys.
'42': >-
  Struck by the sword-blow, Hanūmān, son of the Wind, mighty in valor, smote
  Trimūrdhā upon the chest with his palm.
'43': >-
  Smitten by that palm, Triśirā—his weapon slipping from his hand—fell to the
  ground, of great splendor, bereft of consciousness.
'44': >-
  As he fell, the great monkey snatched away his sword, and roaring like a
  mountain, terrified all the Rākṣasas.
'45': >-
  Unable to bear that roar, the night-ranger sprang up; and leaping at Hanūmān,
  he struck him with his fist.
'46': >-
  By that blow of the fist the great monkey grew exceedingly wrathful; and,
  enraged, he seized the bull among Rākṣasas by the crown upon his head.
'47': >-
  Then the son of the Wind, furious, with a keen sword cut off his heads—adorned
  with crowns and ear-rings—just as Indra, in wrath, cut off the heads of
  Tvaṣṭṛ’s son.
'48': >-
  Those heads—long-eyed, like mountain-peaks, their eyes blazing like the fire
  of Vaiśvānara—fell upon the earth, like bright meteors released from the sun’s
  path.
'49': >-
  When Triśirā, enemy of the gods, was slain by Hanūmān of Indra-like prowess,
  the monkeys roared, the earth shook, and the Rākṣasas fled in all directions.
'50': >-
  Seeing Triśirā slain, and likewise Mahodara, and beholding Devāntaka and
  Narāntaka—hard to assail—also slain,
'51': >-
  that enraged, exceedingly furious foremost of Rākṣasas grew maddened, and then
  seized a blazing mace made wholly of iron.
'52': >-
  It was bound about with bands of gold; smeared with flesh, blood, and foam;
  vast, resplendent, and glutted with the blood of foes.
'53': >-
  Its point flamed with splendor; it was adorned with a garland of blood; and it
  struck terror like Airāvata, the great lotus, and a universal sovereign (by
  its dread majesty).
'54': >-
  Taking up that mace, the maddened Rākṣasa champion, enraged, rushed at the
  monkeys, blazing like the fire at the end of an age.
'55': >-
  Then the bull among monkeys leapt up; and approaching the intoxicated younger
  brother of Rāvaṇa, he, strong, stood in front of him.
'56': >-
  Seeing that monkey, like a mountain, standing before him, he, in wrath, struck
  him on the chest with the mace like a thunderbolt.
'57': >-
  Smitten by that mace, the bull among monkeys—his chest split—was hurled away,
  and much blood flowed forth.
'58': >-
  After a long while regaining consciousness, Ṛṣabha, lord among monkeys,
  enraged and with quivering lips, looked toward Mahāpārśva.
'59': >-
  Then the foremost heroic monkey, rushing with speed toward that Rākṣasa,
  suddenly drew back his fist and struck him between the arms—his form like a
  mountain.
'60': >-
  Mahāpārśva, his foundations cut, fell upon the earth like a tree, his body
  drenched in blood; and Ṛṣabha quickly seized that dreadful mace, like Yama’s
  staff, and roared.
'61': >-
  For a moment that enemy of the gods lay as though lifeless; then, suddenly
  returning to himself, rising—his hue like twilight clouds—he struck the son of
  the lord of waters.
'62': >-
  Ṛṣabha, fainting, fell upon the ground; then after a moment, springing up and
  regaining awareness, he whirled that same mace—like the best of mountains—and
  struck in the fray.
'63': >-
  That terrible mace, reaching the body of that fierce foe—enemy of the gods and
  of sacred rites and of the Brāhmaṇas—split his chest; and abundant blood
  poured out like mineral streams from a lordly mountain.
'64': >-
  Then the great-souled one rushed with speed toward that mace; seizing that
  fearsome mace, he swung it again and again.
'65': >-
  On the very forefront of battle, that great-souled Ṛṣabha struck down
  Mahāpārśva; crushed by his own mace, the Rākṣasa’s teeth and eyes were
  shattered.
'66': >-
  Then the maddened one fell like a mountain struck by a thunderbolt—his eyes
  ruined—upon the earth, his strength and life spent; and when that Rākṣasa
  fell, the Rākṣasa host fled in rout.
'67': >-
  When Rāvaṇa’s brother was slain, that ocean-like army of the Rākṣasas—casting
  away its weapons, seeking only to save life—fled like a shattered sea in
  tumult.
'68': >-
  Thus ends the Seventieth Canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Slaying of Devāntaka and Others.”
