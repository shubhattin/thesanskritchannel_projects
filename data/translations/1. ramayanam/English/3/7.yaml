  Then, in the holy, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa—within the Araṇya Kāṇḍa—begins
  the seventh chapter, named “Sutīkṣṇa’s Hermitage.”
'1': >-
  Rāma, the scorcher of foes, accompanied by his brother and by Sītā, went to
  the hermitage-abode of Sutīkṣṇa, together with those twice-born sages.
'2': >-
  Having travelled a long distance, and having crossed many rivers abounding in
  waters, he beheld a spotless mountain, towering high like the great Meru.
'3': >-
  Then those two scions of Ikṣvāku, the Rāghavas, continually surrounded by
  trees of many kinds, entered that forest, along with Sītā.
'4': >-
  Having entered the terrible wilderness, rich in trees laden with many flowers
  and fruits, he saw, in a secluded spot, a hermitage adorned with garlands of
  bark-cloth.
'5': >-
  There Rāma duly addressed Sutīkṣṇa—the sage seated in austerity, bearing filth
  and mire upon his body, and rich in ascetic wealth.
'6': >-
  “I am Rāma, O Blessed One. I have come to see you. Therefore, O knower of
  dharma—O great seer whose prowess is truthful—do greet me.”
'7': >-
  Then that steadfast sage, having looked upon Rāma, the foremost among
  uphold­ers of dharma, embraced him with both arms and spoke these words:
'8': >-
  “Welcome to you, O best of the Raghus—O Rāma, foremost among those who abide
  by truth. This hermitage, entered by you, is as though it has now gained a
  protector.”
'9': >-
  “Waiting only for you, O greatly renowned hero, I do not ascend from here to
  the world of the gods, casting off this body upon the earth.”
'10': >-
  “I have heard that you have been deprived of the kingdom, taking refuge in
  Citrakūṭa; and that, O Kākutstha, Indra—the divine king of the gods, the
  performer of a hundred sacrifices—has come here (to me).”
'11': >-
  “And the god Mahādeva, lord of the celestials, approached me and declared:
  ‘All the worlds have been won by me through your meritorious deeds.’”
'12': >-
  “In those worlds, frequented by divine seers, which I have conquered by
  austerity—by my grace—dwell here with your wife and with Lakṣmaṇa, and range
  about at ease.”
'13': >-
  To that blazing great seer of fierce austerities, a speaker of truth,
  self-possessed Rāma replied—like Indra replying to Brahmā.
'14': >-
  “I myself shall obtain the worlds, O great sage. Yet it is a dwelling-place
  appointed here in this forest that I desire.”
'15': >-
  “That you are well in every way, and devoted to the welfare of all beings—this
  has been told to me by Śarabhanga and by the great-souled Gautama.”
'16': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, that great seer renowned in the worlds spoke sweet
  words, filled with great joy:
'17': >-
  “This very hermitage, O Rāma—being endowed with virtues—let it be delightful
  to you. It is ever resorted to by hosts of ṛṣis, and ever furnished with roots
  and fruits.”
'18': >-
  “Having come to this hermitage, herds of mighty deer, enticed and free from
  fear on every side, depart again without being slain.”
'19': >-
  “Know indeed that no other fault exists here, except (the disturbance) arising
  from the deer.” Hearing the words of that great seer, Lakṣmaṇa’s elder brother
  (Rāma)...
'20': >-
  ...that steadfast one spoke, grasping his bow together with an arrow: “O
  highly fortunate one, those herds of deer that come assembled here—”
'21': >-
  “—I would slay them with a sharp-pointed arrow, unbending at the joints. If
  you were to treat (the wound) there, what hardship could be greater than
  that?”
'22': >-
  “In this hermitage I am not able to support a long stay.” Having spoken thus,
  Rāma ceased (from that talk) and approached the time of twilight-worship.
'23': >-
  Having performed the evening twilight observance, he made his abode there, in
  Sutīkṣṇa’s lovely hermitage, together with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa.
'24': >-
  Then Sutīkṣṇa himself, the great-souled one, gave auspicious food fit for
  ascetics to those two best of men; and, having honoured them well, he
  presented it when the twilight rites were completed, and night had come into
  view.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the seventh chapter, named “Sutīkṣṇa’s Hermitage,” in the Araṇya
  Kāṇḍa of the holy, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
