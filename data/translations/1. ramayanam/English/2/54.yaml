  Now, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, the
  fifty-fourth canto, entitled “The Arrival at Bharadvāja’s Hermitage.”
'1': >-
  Having spent that auspicious night beneath a great tree, when the spotless sun
  had risen, they set forth from that place.
'2': >-
  Setting their course toward that region where Bhāgīrathī Gaṅgā meets the
  Yamunā, they went on, plunging into a vast forest.
'3': >-
  Those illustrious ones beheld, here and there, many kinds of lands and also
  delightful tracts, seeing places never seen before.
'4': >-
  As they proceeded safely, beholding diverse trees, when only a little of the
  day had passed, Rāma spoke to Saumitrī (Lakṣmaṇa).
'5': >-
  “Look all around, Saumitrī—near Prayāga there is smoke rising aloft. I deem it
  to be the banner-sign of the sacred fire; a sage must be dwelling close by.”
'6': >-
  “Surely we have now reached the confluence of Gaṅgā and Yamunā; for indeed a
  sound is heard—water striking upon water.”
'7': >-
  “Logs are seen, split apart, by forest-dwelling folk who live by such things;
  and near Bharadvāja’s hermitage these various trees are also to be seen.”
'8': >-
  Those two bowmen went on with ease while the sun yet hung in the sky, and at
  the junction of Gaṅgā and Yamunā they reached the sage’s abode.
'9': >-
  Rāma, having come to the hermitage and thereby startling deer and birds, went
  a short distance onward and approached Bharadvāja.
'10': >-
  Then, having reached the hermitage and desiring the sight of the sage, the two
  heroes—followed by Sītā—stood at a distance.
'11': >-
  He entered and beheld the great-souled ṛṣi, surrounded by companies of
  disciples—of steadfast vows, intent upon austerity, and possessed of insight
  gained through tapas.
'12': >-
  Seeing that the most fortunate one had completed his fire-offerings, Rāma—with
  hands joined in reverence—together with Saumitrī and with Sītā, paid his
  respects.
'13': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa’s elder brother then introduced themselves to him: “O Blessed One, we
  are the two sons of Daśaratha—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.”
'14': >-
  “This is my wife, Vaidehī—auspicious, the daughter of Janaka—blameless, who
  has followed me into the solitary forest of austerities.”
'15': >-
  “When my father was sending me into exile, this dear younger
  brother—Saumitrī—followed me; firm in vow, he came after me to the forest
  alone.”
'16': >-
  “Appointed by our father, O Blessed One, we shall enter the forest of
  austerities and there indeed shall practise dharma, subsisting on roots and
  fruits.”
'17': >-
  Hearing those words of the wise prince, the righteous-souled sage then brought
  forward a cow, offerings of honour, and water.
'18': >-
  Providing various kinds of food and savoury dishes—prepared from wild roots
  and fruits—he gave them to them; and that sage of intense austerity also
  arranged lodging.
'19': >-
  Seated with deer and birds about him, and with sages all around, the muni
  honoured the arrived Rāma and welcomed him with words of greeting.
'20': >-
  Having received that honour, and when the descendant of Raghu had taken his
  seat, Bharadvāja then spoke these words, consonant with dharma.
'21': >-
  “After a long time indeed, O Kakutstha, do I see you come here. And I have
  also heard this of you—your banishment without cause.”
'22': >-
  “This is a secluded spot at the meeting of the great rivers—holy and
  delightful. Let the Blessed One dwell here happily.”
'23': >-
  Thus addressed by Bharadvāja, Rāghava—ever intent on the welfare of
  all—replied with auspicious words.
'24': >-
  “O Blessed One, the townspeople and the people of the country are close at
  hand. Seeing me here, they will, I think, easily behold this hermitage.”
'25': >-
  “People will come to see Vaidehī and also to see me. For this reason, I do not
  desire to dwell here.”
'26': >-
  “Look, O Blessed One, for a most excellent hermitage-site at some
  distance—where Vaidehī, the daughter of Janaka, worthy of comfort, may take
  delight.”
'27': >-
  Hearing those auspicious words, Bharadvāja the great sage then spoke to
  Rāghava words that rightly grasped the meaning.
'28': >-
  “Ten krośas from here, dear child, is a mountain where you shall dwell—holy,
  resorted to by great ṛṣis, and pleasant to behold on every side.”
'29': >-
  “Famed as Citrakūṭa, like unto Gandhamādana, it is frequented by monkeys and
  bears, with cows and their young moving about.”
'30': >-
  “So long as a man beholds the peaks of Citrakūṭa, auspiciousness gathers to
  him; his mind does not turn toward sin.”
'31': >-
  “There many ṛṣis, having sported there for a hundred autumns, ascended to
  heaven by tapas—together with their skull-bowls and matted locks.”
'32': >-
  “That dwelling, I deem, will be a fitting and secluded residence for you,
  bringing happiness. Or else, for life in the forest, dwell here, Rāma,
  together with me.”
'33': >-
  Thus Bharadvāja—knower of dharma—received Rāma, that beloved guest, together
  with his wife and with his brother, with all honour and every comfort.
'34': >-
  For Rāma, who had come to that great ṛṣi at Prayāga, the holy night fell as
  they spoke many varied tales.
'35': >-
  Kakutstha, with Sītā as the third, wearied and yet accustomed to comfort,
  spent that night pleasantly in Bharadvāja’s lovely hermitage.
'36': >-
  When the night had dawned into morning, the tiger among men approached
  Bharadvāja and spoke to the sage of blazing splendour.
'37': >-
  “O Blessed One, today we have dwelt in your hermitage, you whose conduct is
  truthful and virtuous. Be pleased to grant us leave for our onward journey.”
'38': >-
  When that night had passed, Bharadvāja said this: “Go to Citrakūṭa, endowed
  with honey, roots, and fruits.”
'39': >-
  “I consider it a suitable dwelling for you, O Rāma of great strength—adorned
  with many groups of mountains and frequented by Kinnaras and serpents.”
'40': >-
  “Resounding with the cries of peacocks and resorted to by lordly elephants,
  let that renowned mountain, Citrakūṭa, be approached by you.”
'41': >-
  “Holy and delightful, abundant in many roots and fruits—there, all about, are
  herds of elephants and herds of deer.”
'42': >-
  “They roam in the forest regions; you shall see them, O Rāghava—also the
  river-banks and springing streams, and caves, ravines, and cascading
  waterfalls.”
'43': >-
  “As you wander together with Sītā, your mind will rejoice. With calls of
  exultant lapwings and the notes of cuckoos it resounds; that auspicious
  mountain, the bearer of the earth, is filled with many intoxicated deer and
  with many elephants. Having reached that exceedingly lovely place, dwell there
  in a hermitage.”
'44': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fourth canto in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Arrival at Bharadvāja’s Hermitage.”
