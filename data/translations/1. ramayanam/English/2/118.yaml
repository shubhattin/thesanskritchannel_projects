  Now begins the one-hundred-and-eighteenth Sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the
  sacred Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Receiving of Divine Ornaments.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed, Vaidehī—Sītā—having duly honored Anasūyā’s words with
  reverence, began to reply gently and with modest speech.
'2': >-
  “This is no wonder, O noble lady, that you speak to me thus; for this also is
  known to me—that for a woman her husband is indeed her guru (revered lord and
  guide).”
'3': >-
  “Even if such a husband, O venerable one, should be lacking in good conduct,
  still he must be served by me without duplicity; even then, he would be one
  whom I should attend upon.”
'4': >-
  “How much more, then, when he is endowed with praiseworthy
  virtues—compassionate, self-controlled, steadfast in affection,
  righteous-souled, dear as a mother and dear as a father!”
'5': >-
  “The conduct that mighty Rāma observes toward Kausalyā—he observes that very
  same conduct toward the other wives of the king as well.”
'6': >-
  “Even when he has seen women only once, the hero—beloved of the king, knower
  of dharma—setting aside pride, behaves toward them as toward mothers.”
'7': >-
  “And when I was coming to this lonely forest, so fearsome in its terrors, my
  mother-in-law’s earnest counsel was set firmly in my heart, and I have held it
  as something great.”
'8': >-
  “And at the time of the giving of my hand—formerly, in the presence of the
  sacred fire—the instruction that my mother gave me, that word too I have kept
  within me.”
'9': >-
  “And by your words, O righteous-living lady, all that has been renewed afresh
  for me: for a woman, there is no other austerity enjoined than service to her
  husband.”
'10': >-
  “Sāvitrī, having practiced devotion in serving her husband, is honored in
  heaven; and you too have attained the celestial worlds through such service to
  your husband.”
'11': >-
  “This indeed is the highest path for all women, and in heaven she is as a
  goddess: Rohiṇī is not seen even for a moment without the Moon.”
'12': >-
  “Women of such a kind—excellent ones, steadfast in their vow to their
  husbands—are honored in the world of the gods by the merit of their own
  righteous deeds.”
'13': >-
  Then Anasūyā, delighted on hearing Sītā’s words, smelled (kissed) her head and
  spoke, gladdening the daughter of Mithilā.
'14': >-
  “By various observances I have obtained great tapas indeed; relying upon that
  power, O Sītā, O pure-smiling one, I wish to bestow favor upon you.”
'15': >-
  “Your speech, O Maithilī, is fitting and pleasing; and I am gratified. Tell me
  what is proper—what shall I do for you?”
'16': >-
  Hearing her words, Sītā—astonished, with gentle wonder—said, “So be it,” to
  Anasūyā, who was endowed with the power born of austerity.
'17': >-
  Thus spoken to, that knower of dharma (Anasūyā) became even more pleased with
  her. “Indeed, O Sītā, I shall make your joy fruitful,” said she.
'18': >-
  “Here are divine and excellent garlands, garments, ornaments, and, O Vaidehī,
  a heavenly unguent, and a most precious anointing paste.”
'19': >-
  “Given by me, O Sītā, these will adorn your limbs; they will be suitable,
  stainless, and ever-lasting.”
'20': >-
  “O daughter of Janaka, your body anointed with this divine unguent, you will
  delight your husband—like Śrī (Lakṣmī) adorning imperishable Viṣṇu.”
'21': >-
  Thereupon Maithilī accepted the garments, the unguent, the ornaments, and the
  garlands—an unsurpassed gift given out of affection.
'22': >-
  And having received that affectionate gift, the illustrious Sītā, with palms
  joined in reverence, stood there attending upon the ascetic lady.
'23': >-
  When Sītā was thus seated near her and serving her well, Anasūyā, firm in
  vows, began to ask her something further—following upon words dear to the
  heart.
'24': >-
  “At the svayaṃvara, it is said, you were obtained by this illustrious
  Rāghava—this tale, O Sītā, has reached my ears.”
'25': >-
  “I wish to hear that account in detail, O Maithilī. As you experienced it, in
  its entirety—tell it to me, you ought to speak it.”
'26': >-
  Thus addressed, Sītā, devoted to dharma, said, “Let it be heard,” and then
  related that story.
'27': >-
  “The lord of Mithilā was the heroic Janaka, a knower of dharma; devoted to the
  duty of a kṣatriya, he ruled the earth according to justice.”
'28': >-
  “As he, plough in hand, was tilling a tract of field, I indeed arose—breaking
  through the ground—as the king’s daughter.”
'29': >-
  “Seeing me, the lord of men—intent on casting aside clods of earth—Janaka was
  struck with wonder, while my whole body was covered with dust.”
'30': >-
  “And since he had no child, out of affection he himself lifted me onto his lap
  and said, ‘She is my daughter’; and his love was placed upon me.”
'31': >-
  “And in the sky a voice spoke to me—indeed, not human—‘So it is, O king of
  men: by dharma she is truly your daughter.’”
'32': >-
  “Then my father, the ruler of Mithilā, righteous-souled, rejoiced; and having
  obtained me, the lord of men attained great prosperity and abundance.”
'33': >-
  “And I was given, as is proper, to the eldest queen, a lady of meritorious
  deeds; and she cherished me with tender affection, with a mother’s loving
  regard.”
'34': >-
  “But when my father saw that my age had come—fit for union with a husband—he
  fell into distressful anxiety, like a man bereft of wealth.”
'35': >-
  “For in this world, the father of a maiden—whether he gives her in marriage to
  one equal or to one inferior—incurs harassment from people, even though he be
  equal to Indra on earth.”
'36': >-
  “Seeing that humiliation not far from himself, the king fell into an ocean of
  worry and found no shore—like one without a boat.”
'37': >-
  “Knowing me to be not born of a womb, the protector of the earth could not,
  though pondering, find for me a husband who was equal and fitting.”
'38': >-
  “Then, as he reflected continually, this resolve arose in that wise one: ‘I
  shall arrange a svayaṃvara for my daughter.’”
'39': >-
  “At a great sacrifice of his, Varuṇa, the great-souled, in delight bestowed an
  excellent bow, and a pair of quivers with inexhaustible arrows.”
'40': >-
  “So heavy was it that even with effort it could not be moved by men; and the
  kings were not able to bend it—not even in their dreams.”
'41': >-
  “After my father obtained that bow, the truth-speaking king proclaimed—when
  the monarchs had assembled, having first invited the kings—”
'42': >-
  “‘Whosoever, lifting this bow, strings it and makes it ready—he shall become
  the husband of my daughter; of this there is no doubt.’”
'43': >-
  “Seeing that excellent bow, like a mountain in its mass because of its weight,
  the kings paid homage and departed—unable even to raise it.”
'44': >-
  “After a very long time, this Rāghava of great splendor came, accompanied by
  Viśvāmitra, to behold the sacrifice; Rāma, whose valor is true, came with his
  brother Lakṣmaṇa.”
'45': >-
  “And Viśvāmitra, righteous-souled and greatly honored by my father, spoke
  there to my father concerning the two brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.”
'46': >-
  “‘These are the two sons of Daśaratha, desiring to see the bow. Show the
  divine bow to Prince Rāma.’”
'47': >-
  “Thus spoken to by that brāhmaṇa, my father had that bow brought forth; and in
  but the interval of a blink, that mighty one (Rāma) bent it.”
'48': And swiftly setting the bowstring upon it, the powerful hero drew it tight.
'49': >-
  “As he drew it with force, the bow broke in the middle into two; and the sound
  that arose was dreadful—like a thunderbolt falling.”
'50': >-
  “Then there my father, intent upon truth, resolved to give me to Rāma and,
  rising for that purpose, took up the excellent vessel of water for the rite.”
'51': >-
  “Yet at that time Rāghava did not accept it when it was being offered, not
  knowing the intention of his father, the lord of Ayodhyā.”
'52': >-
  “Then, having summoned my father-in-law—the aged king Daśaratha—my father gave
  me to Rāma, the knower of his own self.”
'53': >-
  “And my younger sister, the virtuous Urmilā, lovely to behold, was also given
  by my father himself as wife to Lakṣmaṇa.”
'54': >-
  “Thus was I given to Rāma then, in that svayaṃvara; and by dharma I am devoted
  to my husband—the foremost among the mighty in valor.”
'55': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-eighteenth Sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the
  sacred Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the First Poem, entitled “The Receiving of Divine
  Ornaments.”
