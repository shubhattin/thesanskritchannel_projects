  Now begins the fifty-third sarga, named “Rāma’s Agitation (Rāma-saṃkṣobha)”,
  in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Having reached that tree and having taken his seat there, facing the western
  twilight, Rāma—best of those who delight the hearts—spoke thus to Lakṣmaṇa.
'2': >-
  Today this is the first night that has passed outside the land of the people;
  being without Sumantra, you ought not to be anxious on that account.
'3': >-
  From this night onward, we must keep vigil, both of us without sloth, for the
  security and well-being of Sītā rests upon us, O Lakṣmaṇa.
'4': >-
  Somehow, O Saumitri, let us pass this night; let us lie down upon the ground,
  ourselves spreading a bed made of what we have gathered by our own effort.
'5': >-
  Though he was fit for a splendid couch, Rāma lay down upon the earth; and to
  Saumitri he then spoke these auspicious words.
'6': >-
  Surely today the great king sleeps in sorrow, O Lakṣmaṇa; but Kaikeyī, her
  desire fulfilled, ought to be satisfied.
'7': >-
  For that queen Kaikeyī, for the sake of sovereignty, might not even preserve
  the great king’s life-breaths, once she sees Bharata returned.
'8': >-
  Left helpless, and aged, and deprived of me—what will that pleasure-driven
  soul do, once he has come under the control of Kaikeyī?
'9': >-
  Seeing this calamity of the king and the bewilderment of his mind, this is my
  conviction: desire (kāma) is more powerful than both artha and dharma.
'10': >-
  For what man, even if unwise, would abandon, for a woman’s sake, a son who is
  loving and obedient—such a son as I am to my father, O Lakṣmaṇa?
'11': >-
  Happy indeed, together with his wife, is Bharata, Kaikeyī’s son—he alone who
  will rule the rejoicing Kośalans like an overlord.
'12': >-
  For he will become the sole face and foremost figure of the entire kingdom,
  when my father has passed beyond age, and when I have taken refuge in the
  forest.
'13': >-
  He who, abandoning artha and dharma, follows after desire—he quickly comes to
  such ruin, as King Daśaratha has.
'14': >-
  I think Kaikeyī has come, O gentle one, for Daśaratha’s end, for my
  banishment, and for Bharata’s kingdom.
'15': >-
  Perhaps now Kaikeyī, deluded by the intoxication of her good fortune, may, for
  my sake, also torment Kauśalyā and Sumitrā.
'16': >-
  Let not Queen Sumitrā dwell in sorrow because of me. Therefore, you, Lakṣmaṇa,
  enter Ayodhyā in due time.
'17': >-
  I alone shall go to the Daṇḍaka forest together with Sītā; and you shall
  become a protector to the helpless Kauśalyā.
'18': >-
  Kaikeyī is of petty conduct; out of hatred she might act unrighteously. Do you
  entrust my mother to Bharata, who knows dharma.
'19': >-
  Surely in some former birth women were separated from their sons; therefore
  this, O Saumitri, has now come upon my mother as well.
'20': >-
  For I—long nurtured by her, and brought up with toil and sorrow—am separated
  from Kauśalyā at the very time of fruition. Fie upon me!
'21': >-
  Let no woman with the parting line of marriage ever give birth to such a
  son—such as I, O Saumitri, who bestow upon my mother endless grief.
'22': >-
  That affection of hers, I deem, is exceptional and surpassing, O Lakṣmaṇa—of
  her whose speech is heard as sweetly as that of a myna, a parrot, and a cock
  (at dawn).
'23': >-
  When she laments—she of scant good fortune—and I render her no help at all,
  what need has she of a son, she who is as though sonless, because of me, O
  subduer of foes?
'24': >-
  Truly my mother is of little fortune; bereft of me, Kauśalyā lies tormented by
  supreme sorrow, fallen into an ocean of grief.
'25': >-
  I alone, O Lakṣmaṇa—were I enraged—could, with my arrows, cross over
  (overwhelm) both Ayodhyā and even the whole earth; yet what would such prowess
  accomplish, without just cause?
'26': >-
  But, O sinless one, fearing adharma and the world to come, therefore, O
  Lakṣmaṇa, I do not anoint myself (to kingship) today.
'27': >-
  Thus, and many other pitiable things besides, lamenting much in that lonely
  place, Rāma—with face filled with tears—sat in silence in the night.
'28': >-
  When Rāma ceased lamenting—like a fire whose flame has gone out, like an ocean
  stilled and without waves—Lakṣmaṇa consoled him.
'29': >-
  Surely today, O Rāma, best of warriors, the city Ayodhyā, when you have
  departed, is devoid of radiance—like a night from which the moon has gone.
'30': >-
  This is not fitting, O Rāma, that you grieve thus; O bull among men, you cause
  sorrow to Sītā and to me as well.
'31': >-
  For neither can Sītā live without you, nor can I either, O Rāghava—even for a
  moment—like fishes drawn out of the water.
'32': >-
  Neither father, nor Śatrughna, nor Sumitrā, O great ascetic—I would wish to
  see today; without you I would not desire even heaven.
'33': >-
  Then, there, when they were comfortably seated, and when he observed nearby
  that well-made bed beneath the banyan tree, those two—devoted to dharma—lay
  down upon it.
'34': >-
  Hearing Lakṣmaṇa’s excellent and full words, and thus, with reverence,
  accepting forest-dwelling, Rāghava for a long time devoted himself to the
  highest austerity, steadfastly resorting to dharma.
'35': >-
  Then, in that solitary forest at that time, those two mighty ones—enhancers of
  the Rāghava lineage—did not fall into fear or agitation, like two lions
  roaming along a mountain slope.
'36': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-third sarga, named “Rāma’s Agitation (Rāma-saṃkṣobha)”, in
  the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
