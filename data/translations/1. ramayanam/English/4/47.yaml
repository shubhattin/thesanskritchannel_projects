  Now begins the forty-seventh sarga in the Kishkindha-kanda of the glorious
  Valmiki-Ramayana, entitled “The Return of the Monkey-Forces.”
'1': >-
  Then, indeed, for the sake of beholding (and finding) Vaidehi, the foremost of
  monkeys—great elephants among the Vanaras—were dispatched in every direction
  by the king of the monkeys; and, as commanded, they set out swiftly and with
  ease.
'2': >-
  They searched everywhere—lakes, river-banks and thickets, the sky, cities as
  well; and regions protected by rivers and strongholds, and the various
  countries—examining all on every side.
'3': >-
  All the leaders of the Vanara troops, having been instructed by Sugriva,
  searched there through those regions—together with their mountains, forests,
  and woodland groves.
'4': >-
  Having searched through the day, all intent upon the discovery of Sita, the
  Vanaras would return upon the earth at the times of night.
'5': >-
  And in those lands, in every season, the Vanaras, reaching trees bearing
  fruit, made their beds for the night—day after day, all of them.
'6': >-
  Thus, having completed the first day, and when a month had passed, the mighty
  leaders among the monkeys—having come to Prasravana and met the
  monkey-king—returned disappointed and without hope.
'7': >-
  Having searched the eastern quarter exactly as instructed, together with his
  counsellors, the great and powerful Vinata, not seeing Sita, came back.
'8': >-
  And Shatabali too, that mighty monkey, having searched the entire northern
  quarter, returned then with his army, fearful.
'9': >-
  Sushena, having searched the western direction together with the Vanaras, and
  when the month had been completed, returned and approached Sugriva.
'10': >-
  Reaching Sugriva who was stationed upon the slopes of Prasravana, and having
  saluted him, they spoke these words to Sugriva, who was seated together with
  Rama:
'11': >-
  “All mountains have been searched, and the deep and impenetrable forests; the
  rivers that run down to the sea, and all the inhabited kingdoms as well.
'12': >-
  “All the caves too have been searched—those of which you spoke in detail; and
  the great dense thickets, and the spreading masses of creepers and vines have
  also been examined.
'13': >-
  “And in dense regions, in difficult and rugged strongholds, living beings of
  exceeding size were sought out—and some were even slain. Those very dense
  tracts were searched again and again.
'14': >-
  “But Hanuman, born of the Wind-god, of noble courage and high lineage, will
  come to know (and find) the daughter of Mithila, O lord of the Vanaras. The
  very direction in which Sita has gone—that same quarter Hanuman, the son of
  Vayu, has taken his stand upon.”
'15': >-
  Thus ends the forty-seventh sarga in the Kishkindha-kanda of the holy
  Valmiki-Ramayana, the ancient epic, entitled “The Return of the
  Monkey-Forces.”
