  Now begins the thirty-seventh canto of the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Inappropriateness of Bringing Sītā Back (by
  Hanumān).”
'1': >-
  Hearing Hanumān’s words, that Sītā—whose face was like the full moon—spoke to
  him this speech, consonant with dharma and artha.
'2': >-
  “O Vānara, what you have spoken is like nectar mingled with poison—namely,
  that Rāma is not of divided mind, and that he is wholly given over to grief.
'3': >-
  Whether amid vast prosperity, or amid most dreadful adversity, inexorable
  Death drags a man along, as though binding him with a rope.
'4': >-
  Surely, O best of leaping beings, Destiny is irresistible for living
  creatures. Behold Lakṣmaṇa, me, and Rāma—all deluded and overwhelmed by
  calamities.
'5': >-
  How will Rāghava find the far shore of this grief—like one who, swimming and
  turning about, has circled in the ocean after his boat is destroyed?
'6': >-
  After slaying the Rākṣasas, after destroying Rāvaṇa, after laying Lanka
  waste—when will my lord behold me again?
'7': >-
  Tell him, ‘Make haste,’ before it is too late; for this period of one year is
  the limit of time for my life.
'8': >-
  The tenth month is now passing, O Plavaṅgama; only two remain of the appointed
  time that was fixed for me by the cruel Rāvaṇa.
'9': >-
  And Vibhīṣaṇa too—his brother—has, with effort, repeatedly entreated him about
  my release; yet he does not resolve to do it.
'10': >-
  For giving me back does not please Rāvaṇa. He seeks death in battle—death that
  comes under the dominion of Time.
'11': >-
  Kape, a maiden named Kalā, the eldest daughter of Vibhīṣaṇa, told me this
  herself—she having been sent by her mother.
'12': >-
  There is a wise man named Avindhya, learned, foremost among
  Rākṣasas—steadfast, of good conduct, aged, and greatly respected by Rāvaṇa.
'13': >-
  He reminded the Rākṣasas of the destruction that would come from Rāma; but
  that wicked-souled one does not heed his wholesome counsel.
'14': >-
  O best of monkeys, I have hope that my husband will swiftly reach me; for my
  inner self is pure, and there are many virtues in him.
'15': >-
  Energy, manliness, fortitude, compassion, gratitude, valor, and prowess—these
  are found in Rāghava, O Vānara.
'16': >-
  He who, in Janasthāna, slew fourteen thousand Rākṣasas even without his
  brother—what enemy would not fear him?
'17': >-
  That bull among men cannot be measured against by calamities. I know his
  greatness—like Pulomā’s daughter (Śacī) knows Indra’s.
'18': >-
  O Kape, the sun that is Rāma—radiant with a net of arrows—will dry up the
  watery host of Rākṣasa foes.
'19': >-
  As she spoke thus—worn with sorrow, speaking for Rāma’s sake, her face filled
  with tears—Hanumān the monkey addressed her.
'20': >-
  “Having heard my words, Rāghava will come quickly, drawing along a mighty army
  crowded with hosts of monkeys and bears.
'21': >-
  Or else, this very day I shall deliver you from this Rākṣasa. Mount upon my
  back, O blameless lady, and rise out of this misery.
'22': >-
  Placing you upon my back, I shall cross the ocean. Indeed, I have the power to
  carry even Lanka along with Rāvaṇa.
'23': >-
  O Maithilī, standing on Mount Prasravaṇa, I shall this day deliver you to
  Rāghava, as fire delivers the oblation offered to Indra.
'24': >-
  This very day, O Vaidehī, you shall see Rāghava with Lakṣmaṇa—firm in
  resolve—like Viṣṇu at the slaying of the Dānavas.
'25': >-
  You shall see the mighty one dwelling in the hermitage, heartened by the sight
  of you—like Purandara seated upon the summit of the lord of mountains.
'26': >-
  Mount my back, O goddess-like lady; do not doubt, O beautiful one. Seek union
  with Rāma as Rohiṇī does with the moon.
'27': >-
  As Rohiṇī, as though conversing with the moon, comes to union—so do you mount
  my back and cross through the sky over the great ocean.
'28': >-
  For as I depart from here taking you, O fair-limbed one, none of all the
  inhabitants of Lanka will be able to follow my course.
'29': >-
  Just as I came here, so shall I certainly go—behold, O Vaidehī—lifting you up
  and moving through the heavens.
'30': >-
  But Maithilī, hearing that marvelous speech from the best of monkeys, her
  whole body thrilled with joy and wonder, then spoke to Hanumān:
'31': >-
  “Hanumān, how do you wish to carry me over so long a path? That indeed is what
  I think to be your monkeyhood, O leader of the monkey-hosts.
'32': >-
  How, being of small body, do you wish to take me from here to my husband, the
  lord of men, O bull among leaping beings?”
'33': >-
  Hearing Sītā’s words, Hanumān, son of the Wind-god, illustrious and fortunate,
  reflected that a new slight had been offered (to his capability).
'34': >-
  “The large-eyed lady does not know my strength or my might. Therefore let
  Vaidehī behold a form of mine at my will.”
'35': >-
  Thinking thus, Hanumān—best among leaping beings, crusher of foes—showed Sītā
  his true form.
'36': >-
  Then the wise bull among monkeys, springing down from that tree, began to
  enlarge himself, in order to create confidence in Sītā.
'37': >-
  Resembling Meru and Mandara, radiant like a blazing fire, the bull among
  monkeys stood forth before Sītā.
'38': >-
  That monkey, mountain-like, copper-faced, of great strength—terrible with
  vajra-like fangs and nails—said this to Vaidehī:
'39': >-
  “I have the power to carry this Lanka—with its mountains, forests, and tracts
  of land, together with its ramparts and gate-towers—whether protected (by its
  lord) or not.”
'40': >-
  “Therefore let your mind be settled; enough of doubt, O lady. O Vaidehī, make
  Rāghava together with Lakṣmaṇa free from sorrow.”
'41': >-
  Seeing him like a mountain, the daughter of Janaka—she of lotus-petal-wide
  eyes—spoke to the true-born son of Māruta:
'42': >-
  “I know your strength and your power, O great monkey; your speed too is like
  the Wind’s, and your splendor is wondrous like Fire’s.
'43': >-
  How could any ordinary being reach this shore across the immeasurable sea, O
  leader of the monkey-hosts?
'44': >-
  I know your ability both to go and also to carry me. Still, swiftly consider
  well, as one would (consider) the accomplishment of one’s own purpose.
'45': >-
  But it is improper, O best of monkeys, for me to go with you. Your speed—equal
  to the speed of the wind—would bewilder me.
'46': >-
  Clinging in the sky above the ocean, I would surely fall from your back again
  and again, as you went with great velocity.
'47': >-
  And if I fell into the sea, thronged with timi-fish, makaras, and other
  creatures, I would quickly become helpless—an excellent meal for the aquatic
  beings.
'48': >-
  Nor would I be able to go with you, O destroyer of foes; and if you are
  accompanied by a wife, suspicion about you could arise—without doubt.
'49': >-
  Seeing me being carried off, the Rākṣasas of dreadful valor—commanded by the
  wicked Rāvaṇa—would follow in pursuit.
'50': >-
  Surrounded by those warriors with spears and maces in their hands, you would
  be brought into peril, O hero, because of me—(and then) you would indeed be
  one who has a burden (a wife to protect).”
'51': >-
  Many armed Rākṣasas would be in the sky, while you would be unarmed. How could
  you fight them and also protect me?
'52': >-
  While you were fighting those Rākṣasas—cruel in their deeds and hovering
  about—terror-stricken, I would fall from your back, O best of monkeys.
'53': >-
  And if those fearsome Rākṣasas—great and powerful—were somehow to overcome you
  in that final encounter, O best of monkeys—
'54': >-
  Or if, while you were fighting, I were to fall from you as you turned away,
  then the sinful Rākṣasas would seize me and carry me off.
'55': >-
  They might snatch me from your hand and kill me as well; for in battle victory
  and defeat appear uncertain and unstable.
'56': >-
  Or I too might come to ruin, being threatened on all sides by Rākṣasas; and
  your effort, O best of monkeys, would become wholly fruitless.
'57': >-
  Even though you are indeed capable of slaying all the Rākṣasas, still the
  glory of Rāghava would be diminished if the Rākṣasas were slain by you.
'58': >-
  Or else, having seized me, they might hide me in some concealed place, where
  neither the monkeys nor even Rāghava would know.
'59': >-
  Thus this undertaking on my account would become vain—and then your work would
  be without purpose; for your great merit lies in going with Rāma.
'60': >-
  Upon me depends the life of mighty Rāghava, and of his brothers, O great-armed
  one—and also of you and of your royal line.
'61': >-
  Without hope because of me, and worn away by the torment of grief,
  they—together with all the bears and monkeys—will abandon the struggle for
  life.
'62': >-
  Putting foremost my devotion to my husband, O Vānara, I do not wish of my own
  will to touch the body of any other than Rāma, O best of monkeys.
'63': >-
  When I was taken by force to the touch of Rāvaṇa’s body, being powerless—what
  can I do, without a protector, helpless as I am?
'64': >-
  If Rāma, having slain Daśagrīva here together with the Rākṣasas, were then to
  take me from here and go—then that would be worthy of him.
'65': >-
  I have heard and indeed seen the prowess of that great-souled one, the crusher
  of foes in battle. Neither gods, nor Gandharvas, nor serpents, nor Rākṣasas
  are equal to Rāma in combat.
'66': >-
  Beholding Rāghava in battle—wondrous in his bow, of great strength, of valor
  equal to Vāsava (Indra), with Lakṣmaṇa—who could endure him, like a blazing
  fire driven by the wind?
'67': >-
  With Lakṣmaṇa, Rāghava, the smiter of foes in war, stands like an enraged
  directional elephant; who in battle could withstand him, O chief of
  monkeys—him whose arrow-fires are like the sun at the end of an age?
'68': >-
  Therefore, O best of monkeys, quickly bring here my beloved Rāma together with
  Lakṣmaṇa and with the leaders of the hosts. Long have I been worn by grief for
  Rāma—make me glad, O heroic monkey.
'69': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-seventh canto of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the holy, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the first epic, entitled “The Inappropriateness of
  Bringing Sītā Back (by Hanumān).”
