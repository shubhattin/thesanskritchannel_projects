  Now begins the twenty-ninth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Sītā’s insistence and entreaty to accompany (Rāma) to the
  forest.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words of Rāma, Sītā was afflicted with sorrow; with her face
  bathed in unceasing tears, she gently spoke these words.
'2': >-
  The faults which you have enumerated concerning dwelling in the forest—know
  them, out of love for you, to be only virtues in my eyes.
'3': >-
  Deer and lions, elephants and tigers, and also śarabhas; camaras and sṛmaras
  as well—indeed all those other creatures that roam the forest—
'4': >-
  Since they have never before seen a form like yours, O Rāghava, on seeing your
  form they would all withdraw and flee; for all of them would surely fear you.
'5': >-
  And I, by the command of the elders, must go together with you; without you, O
  Rāma, I must abandon life here.
'6': >-
  For even Indra himself, O Rāghava—the sovereign lord of the gods—is not able,
  by force of might, to violate me while I am near you.
'7': >-
  But a woman who is without her husband cannot live. Indeed, O Rāma, such is
  the example you have set before me.
'8': >-
  Moreover, O exceedingly wise one, I have heard from brāhmaṇas—truly, long ago
  in my father’s house—that I must dwell in the forest.
'9': >-
  Having heard that saying at home from those twice-born men who bear the
  auspicious marks, O mighty-armed one, I have ever been inspired with zeal for
  forest-dwelling.
'10': >-
  That command for forest-dwelling must indeed be attained by me; therefore,
  beloved, I shall go with you, my husband—no otherwise.
'11': >-
  I shall be one whose injunction is fulfilled; I shall go together with you.
  And now this time has come—let that brāhmaṇa’s word prove true.
'12': >-
  For I know that in a forest-dwelling many kinds of hardships are certainly met
  with by men, O hero—by men who are not self-controlled.
'13': >-
  Even when I was a maiden in my father’s house, I heard of forest-dwelling, in
  the very presence of my mother, a mendicant woman of peaceful conduct.
'14': >-
  And earlier, O lord, you yourself were long entreated by me; for I have
  desired to go with you to the forest-dwelling.
'15': >-
  I have made my resolve, for your welfare, O Rāghava, regarding the journey.
  The life of one who goes to the forest with a hero delights me.
'16': >-
  O pure-souled one, through love itself I shall be free from stain, following
  my husband; for the husband is indeed the supreme deity to a wife.
'17': >-
  And after death, my blessed union with you is ever (ordained). For there is
  heard a holy teaching—proclaimed by illustrious brāhmaṇas—
'18': >-
  That the woman who, in this world, has been given in water by her parents
  according to dharma to a man, O mighty-armed one, belongs to him even after
  death.
'19': >-
  Thus—me, your own wife, of good conduct and faithful in vow to her husband—why
  do you not approve of taking me from here? For what reason?
'20': >-
  Me—devoted, faithful in my wifely vow, helpless, your equal in pleasure and
  pain—me, who shares the same joys and sorrows—you ought to take, O scion of
  Kakutstha.
'21': >-
  If, though I am distressed thus, you do not wish to take me to the forest,
  then, as the cause of death, I shall resort to poison, or fire, or water, or
  the noose.
'22': >-
  In this way, with many arguments, she implored him about going; but the
  mighty-armed one did not consent to take her to the solitary forest.
'23': >-
  Thus spoken to, the daughter of Mithilā fell into anxious thought, as though
  she were bathing the earth with warm tears that fell from her eyes.
'24': >-
  Then, to turn her back from such thoughts, the self-possessed Kakutstha
  greatly consoled the Vaidēhī, though she was seized with anger.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-ninth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “Sītā’s insistence and entreaty to
  accompany (Rāma) to the forest.”
