  Now, in the sacred and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, begins
  the forty-ninth chapter, called “The Release of Ahalyā from the Curse.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon Śakra (Indra), rendered fruitless, spoke—his eyes trembling with
  fear—to the gods with Agni at their head, and to the Siddhas, Gandharvas, and
  Cāraṇas.
'2': >-
  ‘By my act, I obstructed the austerities of the great-souled Gautama; and
  indeed, by provoking his wrath, I have accomplished this work on behalf of the
  gods.
'3': >-
  ‘Yet I have been made fruitless by him in his anger, and she too has been cast
  off. By the mighty means of release from the curse, his austerity has been
  taken away—by me.
'4': >-
  ‘Therefore, may all of you—O foremost of the gods, together with the hosts of
  Ṛṣis and with the Cāraṇas—deem it fitting to make this deed done for the gods
  become fruitful.’
'5': >-
  Hearing the words of Śatakratu (Indra), all the gods, with Agni at their head,
  approached the Pitṛ-devas (the divine Fathers) and spoke, together with the
  companies of Maruts.
'6': >-
  ‘This ram is possessed of testicles, while Śakra has been made without them.
  Taking the ram’s testicles, quickly bestow them upon Śakra.’
'7': >-
  ‘This ram, made fruitless, will bestow supreme satisfaction—to gladden you;
  and those human beings too who will offer (such rams) in sacrifice—upon them
  you shall bestow abundant, imperishable fruit.’
'8': >-
  Hearing Agni’s words, the assembled Pitṛ-devas tore away the ram’s testicles
  and implanted them in Sahasrākṣa (the thousand-eyed Indra).
'9': >-
  From that time onward, O scion of Kakutstha, the Pitṛ-devas, when assembled,
  partake of rams that are fruitless, and they unite those (offerers) with their
  fruits.
'10': >-
  And from that time onward, O Rāghava, Indra became the one with the ram’s
  testicles—such was the power, and such the austerity, of the great-souled
  Gautama.
'11': >-
  ‘Now come, O great in splendor, to the hermitage of that holy actor; and
  deliver that greatly fortunate Ahalyā, who is like a goddess in form.’
'12': >-
  Hearing Viśvāmitra’s words, Rāghava (Rāma), together with Lakṣmaṇa, placing
  Viśvāmitra in front, entered the hermitage.
'13': >-
  And he beheld that greatly fortunate lady, her radiance illumined by
  austerity—hard to behold even for the worlds when gathered together, (and)
  difficult to gaze upon even for gods and asuras.
'14': >-
  She appeared like a divine, illusion-wrought creation fashioned by the Creator
  with careful effort; her limbs were surrounded, as it were, with smoke, like a
  blazing tongue of fire.
'15': >-
  Covered with frost, veiled as with cloud, she shone like the radiance of the
  full moon; difficult to assail like (a blazing orb) in the midst of waters,
  she blazed like the splendor of the sun.
'16': >-
  Indeed, by Gautama’s word she had become difficult to behold—until the sight
  of Rāma—for the three worlds as well. Having reached the end of the curse, she
  came to (receive) their sight.
'17': >-
  Then the two sons of Raghu took hold of her feet with joy; remembering
  Gautama’s word, she accepted the two of them.
'18': >-
  Composed and attentive, she offered water for the feet, the arghya-offering,
  and due hospitality. The scion of Kakutstha accepted them according to the
  rite prescribed.
'19': >-
  A great shower of flowers fell, accompanied by the sound of the divine
  kettledrums; and a great festival arose among the Gandharvas and the
  Apsarases.
'20': >-
  The gods honored that Ahalyā, saying, ‘Well done! Well done!’—she whose limbs
  were purified by the power of austerity, who remained obedient to Gautama’s
  will.
'21': >-
  Gautama too, of great splendor, happy together with Ahalyā, worshiped Rāma in
  due form; and the great ascetic then practiced austerities.
'22': >-
  Rāma also, having duly received from the great sage Gautama the highest honor,
  then departed for Mithilā.
'23': >-
  Thus ends, in the venerable, sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, in the
  Bālakāṇḍa, the forty-ninth chapter called “The Release of Ahalyā from the
  Curse.”
