  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-ninth sarga, entitled “The Shattering of Khara’s Mace.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, seeing Khara deprived of his chariot yet standing firm with a mace
  in hand, that mighty and radiant hero spoke—first gently, and then with
  sternness—in these words:
'2': >-
  “While you stand amid a great host thronged with elephants, horses, and
  chariots, you have wrought a dreadful deed, one condemned and loathed by all
  the worlds.
'3': >-
  “A cause of terror to living beings, a cruel one, a doer of sinful acts—such a
  one cannot endure, even if he were a lord over all the three worlds.
'4': >-
  “O night-ranger, whoever commits deeds opposed to the order of the world is
  struck down sharply by all people, as one would strike a wicked serpent that
  has come near.
'5': >-
  “He who, out of greed or out of desire, commits sins and does not
  understand—while exulting, he beholds his own end, as a brahmaṇī-snake (a
  deadly serpent) beholds the hand (that reaches toward it),”
'6': >-
  “You have slain great and fortunate ascetics—righteous in conduct—dwelling in
  the Daṇḍaka forest. Tell me, O rākṣasa: by killing such noble ones, what fruit
  do you think you will attain?
'7': >-
  “Not for long do the cruel, sinful-doers—abhorred by the world—stand firm even
  after obtaining lordship; they are like trees whose roots have decayed.
'8': >-
  “Surely the doer obtains the fruit of his sinful deed—terrible when the time
  has fully come—just as a tree, in its season, obtains its flower.
'9': >-
  “Not long does it take in this world for the fruit of sinful actions to be
  obtained, O night-ranger—like food mixed with poison, once eaten, (soon yields
  its result).
'10': >-
  “As for those who practice dreadful sin, desiring what is hateful to the
  world—by the king I have been sent forth and have come here, O niśācara, to
  take away your life-breaths.
'11': >-
  “Today, the arrows released by me—adorned with gold—shall pierce you and,
  tearing through you, shall pass on, like serpents cleaving through an anthill.
'12': >-
  “Those righteous ones whom you have devoured in the Daṇḍaka forest—today,
  slain in battle, you shall follow them, along with your army.
'13': >-
  “Today let the supreme seers behold you struck down by arrows; and those whom
  you formerly slew, now abiding in heaven-cars though stationed in hell by your
  deed, shall behold it as well.”
'14': >-
  “Strike as you please; make your effort, O basest of your lineage. Today I
  shall cause your head to fall, like a palmyra fruit.”
'15': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, Khara—angered, his eyes reddened—then replied to Rāma,
  laughing, overwhelmed by wrath:
'16': >-
  “Having slain common rākṣasas in battle, O son of Daśaratha, how is it that
  you, on your own, praise yourself—though you are not worthy of praise?
'17': >-
  “Those bull-like men who are valorous and strong say nothing at all; and those
  who are overly proud of their might speak in that manner (as you do).
'18': >-
  “But ordinary men, ungoverned in themselves—mere dregs among kṣatriyas of the
  world—boast to no purpose, just as you boast, O Rāma.”
'19': >-
  “In battle, what hero will speak by pointing to his lineage? But when the time
  of death has arrived, you offer praise of yourself without any fitting
  occasion.”
'20': >-
  “By your boasting, in every way, your littleness has been displayed—like
  gold’s mere semblance when tested by the burning of kuśa-grass fire.”
'21': >-
  “You do not see me standing here, bearer of the mace—unshakable like a
  mountain, earth-supporting, studded with ores.”
'22': >-
  “I, with mace in hand, am sufficient to take away your life-breaths in
  battle—like Antaka (Death) holding the noose, even for the three worlds.”
'23': >-
  “Though much could indeed be spoken to you, I shall not speak it; the sun is
  going to set, and then there would arise an obstacle to the battle.”
'24': >-
  “Fourteen thousand rākṣasas of yours have been slain. By destroying you today,
  I shall wipe away their tears (and grief).”
'25': >-
  Having spoken thus, exceedingly enraged, Khara hurled at Rāma that mighty
  mace—like a blazing thunderbolt.
'26': >-
  That great mace, released by Khara’s arm, blazing forth, went near him,
  turning trees and thickets into ashes as it sped on.
'27': >-
  Seeing that great mace rushing down—like the noose of death—moving through the
  sky, Rāma cut it into many pieces with his arrows.
'28': >-
  Sundered and shattered by the arrows, it fell upon the surface of the
  earth—like a she-serpent struck down by the power of mantras and herbs.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-ninth sarga of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the First Epic, entitled “The Shattering of Khara’s Mace.”
