'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (Paramātman).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': 'Now, the Sixth Chapter: The Yoga of Self-Control (Ātma-saṁyama-yoga).'
'3': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'4': >-
  He who performs the work that ought to be done, without depending upon the
  fruit of action—he is a renunciate (sannyāsī) and he is a yogī; not he who is
  without sacred fire, nor he who is without action.
'5': >-
  That which they call renunciation, know that to be Yoga, O Pāṇḍava; for no one
  becomes a yogī who has not renounced his resolve-born desires (saṅkalpas).
'6': >-
  For the sage who seeks to ascend to Yoga, action is said to be the means; but
  for him who has ascended to Yoga, tranquility (śama) is said to be the means.
'7': >-
  When a man is not attached either to sense-objects or to actions, then—having
  renounced all resolves—he is said to have ascended to Yoga.
'8': >-
  Let a man lift up the self by the Self; let him not degrade the self. For the
  Self alone is the friend of the self, and the Self alone is the enemy of the
  self.
'9': >-
  For him whose self has been conquered by the Self, the Self is a friend; but
  for one who is not self-mastered, the Self itself behaves as an enemy—like an
  enemy indeed.
'10': >-
  For one who has conquered himself, who is peaceful and composed, the Supreme
  Self is steadfastly realized—alike in cold and heat, in pleasure and pain, and
  likewise in honor and dishonor.
'11': >-
  That yogī is said to be united (yukta) who is satisfied with knowledge and
  realized wisdom (jñāna and vijñāna), who is unshaken, who has conquered the
  senses, and to whom a clod of earth, a stone, and gold are the same.
'12': >-
  He excels whose understanding is equal toward the well-wisher, the friend, the
  enemy, the indifferent, the neutral, the hateful, and the kinsman; and even
  toward the righteous and the sinful.
'13': >-
  Let the yogī continually discipline himself, abiding in seclusion; alone, with
  mind and self controlled, free from hope and free from possessiveness.
'14': >-
  In a clean place, having established a firm seat for himself—neither too high
  nor too low—covered with cloth, deerskin, and kuśa grass,
'15': >-
  There, having made the mind one-pointed, controlling the activities of mind
  and senses, let him sit on the seat and practice Yoga for the purification of
  the self.
'16': >-
  Holding the body, head, and neck erect and still, steady and unmoving, gazing
  at the tip of his own nose and not looking in the directions,
'17': >-
  With a serene mind, free from fear, established in the vow of brahmacarya
  (continence), having restrained the mind, with the mind fixed on Me—let him
  sit united, having Me as the supreme goal.
'18': >-
  Thus constantly disciplining himself, the yogī of controlled mind attains
  peace—the supreme Nirvāṇa—abiding in Me.
'19': >-
  Yoga is not for him who eats too much, nor for him who does not eat at all;
  not for him who is given to excessive sleep, nor for him who keeps awake too
  much, O Arjuna.
'20': >-
  For him who is moderate in food and recreation, moderate in exertion in
  actions, and moderate in sleep and wakefulness, Yoga becomes the destroyer of
  sorrow.
'21': >-
  When the disciplined mind rests in the Self alone, and one becomes free from
  longing for all desires, then he is said to be united (yukta).
'22': >-
  As a lamp in a windless place does not flicker—such is said to be the likeness
  of the yogī of controlled mind, practicing Yoga of the self.
'23': >-
  Where the mind, restrained by the practice of Yoga, comes to rest; and where,
  beholding the Self by the self in the Self, one is satisfied in the Self—
'24': >-
  Where one knows that infinite bliss which is grasped by the intellect yet
  transcends the senses; and established there, one does not move from the
  truth—
'25': >-
  Having attained which, one thinks there is no greater gain beyond it; and
  established in which, one is not shaken even by heavy sorrow—
'26': >-
  Let that be known as Yoga—the disunion from the contact with sorrow. That Yoga
  should be practiced with firm resolve, with a mind that does not become
  despondent.
'27': >-
  Having utterly abandoned all desires born of resolve, without remainder, and
  having restrained the entire multitude of senses on every side by the mind
  alone,
'28': >-
  Let him gradually attain quietude, little by little, by the intellect held
  firm through steadiness (dhṛti); and having fixed the mind in the Self, let
  him think of nothing whatsoever.
'29': >-
  Wherever the restless and unsteady mind wanders, from that and that let him
  restrain it and bring it under the control of the Self alone.
'30': >-
  To this yogī of tranquil mind comes the highest bliss—his rajas
  (restlessness/passion) calmed, he having become Brahman, free from stain.
'31': >-
  Thus constantly disciplining himself, the yogī, freed from impurity, easily
  attains the boundless bliss of contact with Brahman.
'32': >-
  With the self united by Yoga, seeing equally everywhere, he beholds the Self
  abiding in all beings, and all beings in the Self.
'33': >-
  He who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me—to him I am not lost, and
  he is not lost to Me.
'34': >-
  He who, established in oneness, worships Me as dwelling in all beings—though
  abiding in every condition, that yogī abides in Me.
'35': >-
  He who sees equality everywhere by comparison with himself, O Arjuna—whether
  in pleasure or in pain—he is regarded as the supreme yogī.
'36': 'Arjuna said:'
'37': >-
  This Yoga of equanimity which has been taught by You, O Madhusūdana—its steady
  continuance I do not see, because of the restlessness (of the mind).
'38': >-
  For the mind is restless indeed, O Kṛṣṇa—turbulent, strong, and obstinate; I
  deem its restraint as exceedingly difficult, like that of the wind.
'39': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'40': >-
  Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed one, the mind is difficult to restrain and
  restless; but, O son of Kuntī, it is held in check by practice (abhyāsa) and
  by dispassion (vairāgya).
'41': >-
  Yoga, in My view, is hard to attain for one who is not self-controlled; but
  for the self-controlled man who strives, it can be attained by proper means.
'42': 'Arjuna said:'
'43': >-
  He who is not diligent (in Yoga), yet is endowed with faith; whose mind has
  strayed from Yoga; not having attained perfection in Yoga—what goal does he
  reach, O Kṛṣṇa?
'44': >-
  Fallen from both, does he not perish like a rent cloud, O mighty-armed
  one—without support, deluded on the path to Brahman?
'45': >-
  This doubt of mine, O Kṛṣṇa, You should completely dispel without remainder;
  for none other than You can be the dispeller of this doubt.
'46': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'47': >-
  O Pārtha, neither here nor hereafter is there destruction for him. For no one
  who does good, My child, goes to an evil end.
'48': >-
  Having attained the worlds of the righteous and having dwelt there for
  everlasting years, one who has fallen from Yoga is born in the house of the
  pure and prosperous.
'49': >-
  Or else he is born in the family of yogīs alone—of the wise. Verily, such a
  birth as this is more difficult to obtain in the world.
'50': >-
  There he regains that union with understanding (buddhi-saṁyoga) acquired in a
  former body; and from that point he strives again for perfection, O joy of the
  Kurus.
'51': >-
  By that very former practice he is carried onward even against his will; and
  even one who merely seeks to know Yoga transcends the Veda as sound
  (śabda-brahman).
'52': >-
  But the yogī who strives with effort, purified of sin, perfected through many
  births—then attains the supreme goal.
'53': >-
  The yogī is deemed superior to ascetics, superior also to men of knowledge,
  and superior to men of action; therefore become a yogī, O Arjuna.
'54': >-
  And among all yogīs, he who worships Me with faith—his inmost self absorbed in
  Me—is deemed by Me to be the most perfectly united (yuktatama).
'55': >-
  Om Tat Sat—thus in the Upaniṣads of the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, in the knowledge
  of Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
  Arjuna, ends the Sixth Chapter entitled “The Yoga of Self-Control.”
