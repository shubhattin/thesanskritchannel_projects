  Now begins the one-hundred-and-tenth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the
  glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Recital of the Ikṣvāku Dynasty.”
'1': >-
  Knowing that Rāma was angered, Vasiṣṭha spoke to him in reply: “Jābāli too
  understands the coming and going (the course and ways) of this world.”
'2': >-
  “But desiring to turn you back (from your resolve), he spoke this speech. O
  lord of men, now hear from me the origin of the world.”
'3': >-
  “All this was once water alone, wherein the earth was formed. Thereafter
  Brahmā came into being, the Self-born, together with the deities; and he,
  becoming a Boar (Varāha), lifted up the earth (the ground of the world) and
  raised it forth.”
'4': >-
  “He created the entire universe, together with sons of disciplined souls.
  Brahmā, born of the sky (ether), is eternal, everlasting, and undecaying.”
'5': “From him was born Marīci; and from Marīci, Kaśyapa as his son.”
'6': >-
  “From Kaśyapa was born Vivasvān (the Sun); and Manu, the son of Vivasvān, the
  Vaivasvata. He indeed was formerly a Prajāpati; and Ikṣvāku was the son of
  Manu.”
'7': >-
  “To whom Manu first bestowed this prosperous earth—know that ancient Ikṣvāku
  to have been the king in Ayodhyā from the earliest time.”
'8': >-
  “Of Ikṣvāku was born the illustrious son renowned as Kukṣi; and of Kukṣi, that
  heroic son Vikukṣi came into being.”
'9': >-
  “Of Vikukṣi was born Bāṇa, the mighty and valiant son; and of Bāṇa, the
  great-armed Anaraṇya, of great fame.”
'10': >-
  “In the reign of King Anaraṇya—best among the virtuous—there was rainfall in
  due variety, there was no famine, and there was not even any thief anywhere.”
'11': >-
  “From Anaraṇya the great-armed king Pṛthu was born. From that great king
  Pṛthu, Triśaṅku was born. That hero, by the power of his truthfulness, went to
  heaven with his body.”
'12': >-
  “To Triśaṅku was born a son, Dhundhumāra of great renown. To the mighty
  Dhundhumāra, Yuvanāśva was born.”
'13': >-
  “From Yuvanāśva was born the illustrious Māndhātṛ. From the mighty Māndhātṛ,
  Susandhi was born.”
'14': >-
  “To Susandhi were two sons—Dhruvasandhi and Prasenajit. From the famous
  Dhruvasandhi was born Bharata, the slayer of foes.”
'15': >-
  “From the great-armed Bharata was born Asita by name—against whom these
  enemy-kings arose: the Haihayas, the Tālajaṅghas, the Śūras, and the
  Śaśibindus.”
'16': >-
  “Arraying himself against them all in counter-formation, the king was driven
  forth in war (into exile/wandering). And on a delightful and excellent
  mountain he lived, delighting in the life of a sage.”
'17': >-
  “And it is heard that his two wives were then with child. One (queen), wishing
  to destroy the embryo of her co-wife, gave her poison.”
'18': >-
  “There was the Bhārgava sage named Cyavana, dwelling near the Himavān.
  Approaching that ṛṣi, Kālintī paid him reverence.”
'19': >-
  “That brāhmaṇa spoke to her, who desired a boon concerning the birth of a son:
  ‘A son shall be born to you, O queen—great-souled and renowned in the worlds;
  righteous, well-conducted, a founder of the line, and a subduer of enemies.’”
'20': >-
  “Having circumambulated the sage in joy, and having obtained his consent, she
  returned; and then the queen bore a son—lotus-leaf-eyed, radiant like a
  lotus-womb (a lotus in its bud), possessed of lotus-like splendor.”
'21': >-
  “But to his co-wife poison had been given, with the intent to slay the embryo;
  and together with that poison, he was born—thus he became Sagara.”
'22': >-
  “That king, named Sagara, is he by whom the ocean was excavated (made to be).
  At the time of a festival, having performed sacrifice swiftly, he afflicted
  these subjects as he moved with speed (in a terrifying course).”
'23': >-
  “And Asamañja was a son of Sagara, so we have heard. While yet alive, that
  evildoer was cast out by his father.”
'24': >-
  “And Aṃśumān too was born—the valorous son of Asamañja. Dilīpa was the son of
  Aṃśumat; and of Dilīpa was Bhagīratha.”
'25': >-
  “From Bhagīratha was born Kakutstha, by whom the Kākutsthas are famed. And
  Kakutstha’s son was Raghu, by whom the Rāghavas are famed.”
'26': >-
  “To Raghu was born the brilliant son, famed as ‘the grown
  man-eater’—Kalmāṣapāda, also called Saudāsa—thus renowned on earth.”
'27': >-
  “To Kalmāṣapāda was born a son famed as Śaṅkhaṇa—who, attaining that heroism,
  was conquered/overpowered even though accompanied by an army.”
'28': >-
  “And Śaṅkhaṇa’s son was the illustrious hero Sudarśana. From Sudarśana came
  Agnivarṇa; from Agnivarṇa, Śīghraga.”
'29': >-
  “To Śīghraga, Maru was born as son; to Maru, Praśuśruka; and to Praśuśruka was
  born Ambarīṣa of great splendor.”
'30': >-
  “To Ambarīṣa was born Nahusha, steadfast in truthful valor. And Nahusha’s son
  was Nābhāga, supremely righteous.”
'31': >-
  “Nābhāga had two sons—Aja and Suvrata. And Aja’s son was the righteous-souled
  King Daśaratha.”
'32': >-
  “Of him you are the eldest heir, widely renowned as Rāma. Therefore accept
  your own kingdom; look after the people, O king.”
'33': >-
  “For among all the Ikṣvākus, the elder becomes king; never is the younger son,
  passing over the elder, consecrated in the kingdom.”
'34': >-
  “Therefore you ought not now to violate the ancient dharma of your own line,
  the family-duty of the Rāghavas. Rule this earth, rich in treasures and
  possessing many realms, like a father—O great in fame.”
'35': >-
  “Thus ends the one-hundred-and-tenth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled ‘The Recital of the Ikṣvāku
  Dynasty.’”}]}
