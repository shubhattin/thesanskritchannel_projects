  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, begins
  the Fortieth Sarga, called “The Vision of Kapila.”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of the gods, the Blessed Grand-sire (Brahmā) indeed replied
  to them—who were exceedingly terrified and whose minds were overpowered by the
  might of Destiny (Kṛtānta).
'2': >-
  “This entire earth belongs to the wise Vāsudeva; she is the consort of
  Mādhava. He alone is the Blessed Lord, the supreme Master.
'3': >-
  “Assuming the form of Kapila, he unceasingly upholds the earth. By the fire of
  his wrath the sons of the king will be burned to ashes.
'4': >-
  “Moreover, the cleaving of the earth has been seen from of old; and likewise,
  the destruction of the sons of Sagara is foreseen by those of far-seeing
  vision.”
'5': >-
  Hearing the Grand-sire’s words, the thirty-three devas—subduers of foes—were
  supremely delighted, and returned again as they had come.
'6': >-
  Then, for Sagara’s sons there arose a mighty sound, like the crash of thunder,
  as the earth was being split open.
'7': >-
  Thereafter, having pierced the whole earth and also having made the circuit in
  due course, all those Sāgaras together spoke these words to their father:
'8': >-
  “The entire earth has been traversed; and creatures possessed of life have
  been slain—devas, dānavas, rākṣasas, piśācas, uragas and pannagas.
'9': >-
  “But we neither behold your horse, nor do we see the thief who has stolen it.
  What are we to do? Prosperity to you—let counsel here be considered.”
'10': >-
  Hearing those words of his sons, the best of kings, Sagara, filled with anger,
  spoke these words, O scion of Raghu:
'11': >-
  “Dig yet again—prosperity to you—splitting the surface of the earth. Having
  reached the horse-thief, return only when your purpose is accomplished.”
'12': >-
  Receiving their father’s command—of great-souled Sagara—those sixty thousand
  sons rushed down into Rasātala (the nether regions).
'13': >-
  As they were digging there, they beheld a direction-elephant, like a
  mountain—of dreadful eyes—supporting the earth.
'14': >-
  That great elephant, Virūpākṣa, upheld upon his head the entire earth, with
  her mountains and forests, O delighter of the Raghus.
'15': >-
  Whenever, O Kakutstha, that great elephant, at the junctions (of time), moves
  his head for the sake of rest, from weariness, then an earthquake comes to
  pass.
'16': >-
  Having gone around that great elephant, the guardian of the quarter, in
  reverence—O Rāma—they proceeded, piercing onward into Rasātala.
'17': >-
  Then, piercing the eastern quarter, they again broke through to the southern.
  And in that southern direction also they saw a great elephant.
'18': >-
  (They saw) Mahāpadma, the great-souled one—vast like a lofty
  mountain—supporting the earth upon his head; and they were filled with the
  highest amazement.
'19': >-
  Having gone around him, those sixty thousand sons of great-souled Sagara broke
  through toward the western direction.
'20': >-
  In the western quarter also, those mighty ones beheld a direction-elephant,
  Sāumanasa, enormous and mountain-like.
'21': >-
  Having gone around him, and also having asked after his well-being, they set
  about digging, advancing then toward the direction called Somavatī.
'22': >-
  In the northern quarter, O best of the Raghus, they beheld Bhadra, white as
  हिम (snow), upholding this earth with his auspicious body.
'23': >-
  Then all of them touched him (in reverence) and went around him; thereafter
  those sixty thousand sons broke through the surface of the earth.
'24': >-
  Then, going to the renowned direction between east and north, all the sons of
  Sagara, in anger, dug into the earth.
'25': >-
  And there, all those great-souled, impetuous, mighty ones beheld
  Kapila—Vāsudeva, the eternal.
'26': >-
  And they saw, not far from that divine being, the sacrificial horse grazing.
  All of them attained boundless joy, O delight of the Raghus.
'27': >-
  But, taking him to be the destroyer of the sacrifice, their eyes agitated with
  wrath, bearing spades and ploughshares, and carrying various trees and rocks,
'28': >-
  they ran toward him in fury, crying, “Stand! Stand!”—(saying), “You have
  stolen our consecrated sacrificial horse!”
'29': >-
  “You evil-minded one, know us to be the sons of Sagara, who have come here!”
  Hearing those words of theirs, O delight of the Raghus, Kapila—
'30': >-
  seized by great wrath, then uttered a fearful humkāra. Thereupon, by that
  immeasurable great-souled Kapila, all the sons of Sagara, O Kakutstha, were
  reduced to heaps of ashes.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the Fortieth Sarga, called “The Vision of Kapila,” in the Bāla-kāṇḍa
  of the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
