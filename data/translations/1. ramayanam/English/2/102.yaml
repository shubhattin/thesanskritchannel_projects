  Now begins the one-hundred-and-second sarga (chapter) of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of
  the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Offering of the Funeral Oblation
  (Nivāpa-dāna).”
'1': >-
  Hearing those compassionate words spoken by Bharata—words that told of their
  father’s death—Rāghava (Rāma) became bereft of consciousness.
'2': >-
  That thunderbolt of speech, harsh and unbearable, spoken by Bharata, struck
  the scorcher of foes (Rāma) like a vajra hurled in battle by a slayer of
  Dānavas.
'3': >-
  Rāma, raising up his arms, fell upon the earth—like a tree whose flowering top
  has been cut down in the forest with an axe.
'4': >-
  There lay Rāma, the lord of the world, fallen upon the ground—like an elephant
  asleep, exhausted by the battering of the bank.
'5': >-
  His brothers, seeing that mighty bowman worn down by grief on every side,
  weeping together with Vaidehī (Sītā), sprinkled him with water.
'6': >-
  Regaining consciousness, the Kakutstha (Rāma) let tears flow from his eyes and
  began, in utter wretchedness, to speak at length.
'7': >-
  Righteous-souled Rāma, having heard that his father, the lord of the earth,
  had gone to heaven, spoke to Bharata words in accordance with dharma.
'8': >-
  “What shall I do in Ayodhyā, when my dear father has gone to his ordained end?
  Who will protect that Ayodhyā, now bereft of the best of kings?”
'9': >-
  “And what duty have I to that great-souled one, I who am ill-born in
  conduct—he who died because of grief for me, and whom I too did not even
  perform the final rites for?”
'10': >-
  “Ah, Bharata, you have indeed accomplished the purpose, O sinless one, since
  the king—together with Śatrughna—has been duly honored by you in all the rites
  for the departed.”
'11': >-
  “Though my forest-dwelling has come to its end, I do not have the heart to go
  to Ayodhyā—made leaderless, distracted, and bereft of its king.”
'12': >-
  “O scorcher of foes, my forest-dwelling is completed; but when my father has
  gone to the other world, who will again govern the people in Ayodhyā?”
'13': >-
  “Formerly, seeing me of good conduct, my father spoke words to comfort me—how
  shall I ever again hear those words that were a delight to the ear?”
'14': >-
  So speaking, Rāghava approached his wife and said, grief-stricken, to Sītā
  whose face was like the full moon:
'15': >-
  “Sītā, your father-in-law is dead. Lakṣmaṇa, you are bereft of a father.
  Bharata declares that the lord of the earth has gone to heaven.”
'16': >-
  When Kakutstha spoke thus, the tears in the eyes of those illustrious princes
  welled up manyfold.
'17': >-
  Then all the brothers, greatly consoling Rāghava, said: “Let the
  water-oblation for father, the lord of the earth, be performed.”
'18': >-
  Sītā, hearing that the king, her father-in-law, had gone to the heavenly
  world, could not look upon her husband with eyes filled with tears.
'19': >-
  After comforting that weeping daughter of Janaka, Rāma, himself distressed,
  spoke to distressed Lakṣmaṇa these words:
'20': >-
  “Bring the pulp-cake of ingudī (a forest fruit), and bring also an upper
  garment of bark-cloth. For the water-rite for my noble father I shall go.”
'21': >-
  “Let Sītā go in front; you go on either side of her. I shall go behind—for
  this path is most dreadful.”
'22': >-
  Then wise Sumantṛa—who was ever an attendant upon them, self-possessed,
  gentle, restrained, tranquil, and of firm devotion to Rāma—
'23': >-
  together with those princes, consoling Rāghava, led them down, supporting
  them, to the auspicious Mandākinī river.
'24': >-
  Those illustrious ones, approaching with difficulty its fair ford, came to the
  delightful Mandākinī, whose groves were ever in bloom.
'25': >-
  Reaching the auspicious, mudless ford where the current ran swift, they
  offered water there to the king, saying, “Let this be for you.”
'26': >-
  Taking water in his cupped palms, the lordly protector of the earth, facing
  the southern quarter, weeping, spoke these words:
'27': >-
  “O tiger among kings, let this pure and imperishable water, given today by me,
  attend upon you who have gone to the world of the Fathers.”
'28': >-
  Then, having come up again from the bank of the Mandākinī, the radiant Rāghava
  performed the food-offering (nivāpa) for his father together with his
  brothers.
'29': >-
  Placing on a spread of darbha grass a cake made of ingudī pulp mixed with
  jujube (badarī), Rāma, afflicted with deepest sorrow, weeping, spoke:
'30': >-
  “Eat this, O great king, being pleased with what we eat; for the deities of
  that person are said to partake of the very food on which the person
  subsists.”
'31': >-
  Then, by that same path, coming up again from the riverbank, the tiger among
  men ascended the mountain with its lovely slopes.
'32': >-
  Then, reaching the doorway of the leaf-hut, the lord of the world embraced
  both Bharata and Lakṣmaṇa with his arms.
'33': >-
  From the sound of their weeping there arose an echo on the mountain—like the
  roaring of lions, those brothers together with Vaidehī.
'34': >-
  Hearing that tumultuous sound of those mighty ones as they wept and performed
  the water-rite for their father, Bharata’s soldiers were struck with fear.
'35': >-
  They said, “Surely Bharata has met with Rāma.” Great indeed was the sound of
  those grieving for their dead father.
'36': >-
  Then, leaving their lodgings, all, turning toward that sound, ran swiftly to
  the spot with minds fixed upon one thing.
'37': >-
  Some went by horses, others by elephants, others by well-adorned chariots; and
  others, though delicate, went on foot.
'38': >-
  All the people, eager to see Rāma—who had been away only a short time, yet
  felt as though long absent—hurried at once to the hermitage.
'39': >-
  There, desiring to see the meeting of the brothers, they hastened by many
  kinds of vehicles, filled with the clatter of hooves and the creaking of
  wheels and naves.
'40': >-
  That ground, struck by many vehicles with hoof and wheel, sent forth a
  tumultuous sound—like the heavens at the gathering of clouds.
'41': >-
  Frightened by that, the elephants, surrounded by their females, went on to
  another forest, making the place resound with their odor (musth).
'42': >-
  Herds of boars and wolves, buffaloes, serpents and monkeys, tigers,
  gocarṇa-deer and gavayas, along with spotted deer, were thrown into alarm.
'43': >-
  Birds called rathāṅga, natyūha, swans, kāraṇḍava-ducks, plavas, as well as
  male cuckoos and krauñcha-birds, senseless with fright, took to the quarters.
'44': >-
  With those birds frightened by the noise, the sky was covered; with men, the
  earth was filled—both then appeared completely thronged.
'45': >-
  Then the people suddenly beheld Rāma—the tiger among men, illustrious, subduer
  of foes—seated upon the bare ground.
'46': >-
  Reproaching Kaikeyī, and also Mantharā with her, the people approached Rāma
  and became of faces filled with tears.
'47': >-
  Seeing those men with tear-filled eyes and deeply sorrowful, he who knew
  dharma embraced them—like a father and like a mother.
'48': >-
  There he embraced some of the men, while some others saluted him; and the
  prince then received all—friends of his own age and kinsmen—each in a manner
  befitting him, upon approaching.
'49': >-
  There, as those great-souled ones wept, their sound made earth and sky
  resound; it was heard continually through mountain-caves and across the
  quarters, like the rolling of a mṛdaṅga-drum.
'50': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-second sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the
  venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, called “The Offering of the
  Funeral Oblation (Nivāpa-dāna).”
