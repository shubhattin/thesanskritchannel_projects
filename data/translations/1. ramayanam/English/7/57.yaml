  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-seventh canto, entitled “The Making of Nimi as the Blinking (in living
  beings).”
'1': >-
  Hearing that wondrous narrative, radiant with a divine splendour and
  marvellous to behold, Lakṣmaṇa—exceedingly delighted—spoke these words to
  Rāghava (Rāma).
'2': >-
  “O scion of the Kakutsthas, how did those two brāhmaṇa-kings—approved of by
  the gods—though their bodies had been laid aside, once more attain union with
  bodies?”
'3': >-
  Hearing what he had spoken, Rāma, whose valour is founded upon truth, related
  that account as it had been told by the great-souled Vasiṣṭha.
'4': >-
  “That jar (kumbha), O best of the Raghus, was filled with the potency (tejas)
  of those two great ones; and in that vessel were produced the two brāhmaṇa
  sages, formed of energy, foremost among ṛṣis.
'5': >-
  “Formerly, the blessed sage Agastya came into being there; and, saying, ‘I am
  not your son,’ he (too) withdrew from that friend (Mitra), departing thence.
'6': >-
  “That very potency of Mitra had earlier been deposited in Urvaśī; and in the
  jar in which the Varuṇa-born potency was present, there came to be that
  potency.
'7': >-
  “Then, in the course of time, Vasiṣṭha—born of Mitra and Varuṇa, endowed with
  that spiritual energy—was born, a divine support of the Ikṣvāku race.
'8': >-
  “Him, the mighty Ikṣvāku, seeing that blameless one just born and resplendent
  with great splendour, chose, O gentle one, as the family priest, for the
  prosperity of his line.
'9': >-
  “Thus has been described, O gentle one, the origin of the great-souled
  Vasiṣṭha, whose body was unprecedented; now hear how the ‘non-blinking’ of
  Nimi came to be.
'10': >-
  “Beholding King Videha (Nimi), all those sages, the wise ones, then initiated
  him into the consecration for the sacrifice (yajña-dīkṣā).
'11': >-
  “And the best of the twice-born guarded the body of that lord of men, attended
  by the townsmen and servants, honouring it with perfumes, garlands, and
  garments.
'12': >-
  “Then, when the sacrifice was completed, Bhṛgu spoke there these words: ‘I
  shall bring back your mind (consciousness); I am pleased with you, O king.’
'13': >-
  “All the gods too, greatly satisfied, spoke likewise to Nimi’s mind: ‘Choose a
  boon, O royal sage; let your mind be duly assigned (a place).’
'14': >-
  “Thus addressed by all the gods, Nimi’s mind then replied: ‘O best of the
  gods, may I dwell in the eyes of all living beings.’
'15': >-
  “‘So be it,’ said the wise gods to Nimi’s mind. ‘Dwelling in the eyes of all
  creatures, you shall move about as the air (vāyu).’
'16': >-
  “‘And for your sake, O lord of the earth, the eyes will blink, as you, moving
  as the wind, seek rest again and again.’
'17': >-
  “Having thus spoken, all the gods departed as they had come; and the
  great-souled sages then took charge of Nimi’s body.
'18': >-
  “There they set down a fire-stick (araṇi) and, with strength, performed the
  churning; and those great ones, by mantra, oblation, and offering into the
  fire, did so then for the sake of producing a son for Nimi.
'19': >-
  “As the araṇi was being churned, a great ascetic manifested. From the churning
  he was called ‘Mithi’; from his begetting he became ‘Janaka’. And because he
  arose from the Videha (body) of Nimi, he is remembered thereafter as
  ‘Vaideha’.”
'20': >-
  “Thus Janaka, the king of Videha, came to be the former (ancestor); and
  because of that great-splendoured Mithi, this land/people came to be known as
  Maithila.”
'21': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-seventh canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Making of Nimi as the
  Blinking (in living beings).”
