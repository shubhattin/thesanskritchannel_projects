'0': >-
  Now begins, in the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the
  seventy-fourth canto, called “The Bringing of the Mountain of Medicinal
  Herbs.”
'1': >-
  When those two (Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa) had thus been struck down on the front of
  battle, the army of the vanara troop-commanders fell into swoon and
  bewilderment; and Sugrīva, Nīla, Aṅgada, and Jāmbavān—none of them could
  comprehend anything, or find any course of action.
'2': >-
  Then Vibhīṣaṇa—foremost among the wise—seeing all that host plunged in
  dejection, spoke to the heroic lords of the monkey-bands, consoling them with
  incomparable words.
'3': >-
  “Do not fear; this is no time for despair. For the noble princes have become
  helpless and despondent only because, bearing the word of the Self-born
  Brahmā, they have been felled by the net of missiles released by Indrajit.
'4': >-
  “To him (Indrajit) indeed was granted this supreme weapon by the
  Self-born—Brahmā’s missile, unfailing and mighty in potency. Since the princes
  honored that (divine ordinance) in the battle, they have been brought down;
  who then has cause for despair here?”
'5': >-
  Then Hanūmān, the wise, having duly honored the Brahma-weapon, and having
  heard the words of Vibhīṣaṇa, spoke these words.
'6': >-
  “In this army of powerful vanaras that has been smitten by the weapon, whoever
  among them still retains his life—him, each and every one, let us go and
  reassure.”
'7': >-
  Then both those heroes—Hanūmān and Vibhīṣaṇa, chief among rākṣasas—bearing
  blazing firebrands in their hands, roamed together in the night over the head
  of the battlefield.
'8': >-
  All around they saw limbs severed—tails, hands, thighs, feet, toes, and
  heads—bodies everywhere streaming and pouring forth blood from their wounds.
'9': >-
  They beheld the earth covered over with fallen vanaras of mountain-like size,
  and with fallen, blazing weapons as well.
'10': They saw Sugrīva, Aṅgada, Nīla, Śarabha, Gandhamādana,
'11': >-
  and Mainda, Nala, Jyotirmukha, and also the vanara Dvivida—Vibhīṣaṇa and
  Hanūmān beheld them lying slain in battle.
'12': >-
  Sixty-seven crores of mighty vanaras had been slain—by that beloved (weapon)
  of the Self-born (Brahmā)—when but a fifth part of the day yet remained.
'13': >-
  Seeing that dreadful host, resembling the surge of the ocean, struck and
  tormented by arrows, Hanūmān, together with Vibhīṣaṇa, sought out Jāmbavān.
'14': >-
  They found him aged by nature’s own old age, heaped over with hundreds of
  arrows—the heroic son of Prajāpati—his radiance waning like a fire dying down.
'15': >-
  Seeing him, the son of Pulastya (Vibhīṣaṇa) approached and spoke these words:
  “O noble sir, have not your vital breaths been destroyed by these sharp
  arrows?”
'16': >-
  Hearing Vibhīṣaṇa’s words, Jāmbavān, the bull among bears, with difficulty and
  in a choking voice, uttered this reply.
'17': >-
  “O lord of the rākṣasas, of great valor! By your voice I recognize you. My
  limbs are pierced by keen arrows, yet I do not behold you with my eyes.
'18': >-
  “And what of Hanūmān—he for whose sake Añjanā became a blessed mother, and
  Mātariśvan (the Wind-god) fulfilled his vow—does Hanūmān, best of vanaras,
  still anywhere sustain life?”
'19': >-
  Hearing Jāmbavān’s words, Vibhīṣaṇa said: “Passing over the noble princes, why
  do you ask about the son of the Wind?”
'20': >-
  “Neither in King Sugrīva, nor in Aṅgada, nor even in Rāghava, have you shown
  such supreme affection, O noble one, as you have shown toward the Wind’s son.”
'21': >-
  Hearing Vibhīṣaṇa’s words, Jāmbavān replied: “Listen, tiger among rākṣasas, to
  the reason why I ask after Māruti (Hanūmān).
'22': >-
  “So long as that hero lives, even a force that is slain is as though unslain.
  But if Hanūmān’s life-breath departs, then even though we live, we are as
  dead.”
'23': >-
  “If Māruti—like unto the Wind himself, and equal to Vaiśvānara (Fire) in
  prowess—still endures, dear one, then hope of life remains.”
'24': >-
  Then approaching the aged Jāmbavān, Hanūmān, son of the Wind, respectfully
  saluted him with humility and reverence, taking hold of Jāmbavān’s feet.
'25': >-
  On hearing Hanūmān’s words, the bull among bears, his senses shaken, felt as
  though he had been born anew.
'26': >-
  Then the mighty and radiant Jāmbavān spoke to Hanūmān: “Come, tiger among
  monkeys—you must save the vanaras.
'27': >-
  “No other is sufficient in valor for these; you are their highest friend. This
  is the hour for your prowess; I see no other at all.
'28': >-
  “Gladden the divisions of the heroic bears and monkeys; and make these
  two—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—who have been struck down, free of the shafts.”
'29': >-
  “Having gone a most distant way, high above the ocean, Hanūmān, you must go to
  Himavant, the best of mountains.
'30': >-
  “There you shall behold the exceedingly lofty golden peak called Ṛṣabha, the
  foremost of mountains, and also the summit of Kailāsa—O slayer of foes.
'31': >-
  “Between those two peaks, blazing with incomparable radiance, you shall see, O
  hero, the mountain bearing all medicinal herbs.
'32': >-
  “On its summit, O tiger among vanaras, you will see four radiant herbs,
  illuminating the ten directions.
'33': >-
  “They are: Mṛta-sañjīvanī, and also Viśalyakaraṇī; Suvarṇakaraṇī as well; and
  the great herb Sandhānī.
'34': >-
  “Taking all of them, Hanūmān, you must return quickly. Restore the vanaras
  with their life-breath by applying them, O son of the Wind.”
'35': >-
  Hearing Jāmbavān’s words, Hanūmān, son of the Wind, was filled with exultant
  strength—like the ocean swelling with the rush of mighty winds.
'36': >-
  Standing upon a mountain-slope, pressing down upon that best of mountains, the
  heroic Hanūmān appeared like a second mountain.
'37': >-
  Crushed by the pressure of the monkey’s feet, that mountain sank down;
  grievously pressed, it was unable to bear itself.
'38': >-
  From it, peaks fell to the ground because of the vanara’s force; and the
  summits, pressed by Hanūmān, were scattered and blazed.
'39': >-
  As that best of mountains was being compressed—its slopes strewn with broken
  trees and rocks—the vanaras could not stand upon it while it whirled and
  reeled.
'40': >-
  With its great gateways shaking and its houses and towers shattered, Laṅkā
  became, in the night, terrified and tumultuous—as though it were dancing
  wildly.
'41': >-
  Resembling a mountain himself, the son of the Wind pressed down upon a
  mountain, and thereby shook the earth together with the ocean.
'42': >-
  Then that vanara mounted the Malaya mountain, like Meru and Mandara, abounding
  in many streams and waterfalls.
'43': >-
  It was strewn with many trees and creepers, with blossoming lotuses and
  water-lilies; frequented by devas and gandharvas; and rose to sixty yojanas in
  height.
'44': >-
  It was resorted to by vidyādharas, hosts of sages, and apsarases; filled with
  various herds of beasts; and beautified with many caverns.
'45': >-
  There, disturbing all the yakṣas, gandharvas, and kinnaras, Hanūmān—cloud-like
  in appearance—grew yet larger, the son of the Wind.
'46': >-
  Pressing the mountain with his feet, opening his mouth like the Mare’s-mouth
  fire, and baring it terribly, he roared aloud, terrifying the night-rangers
  (rākṣasas).
'47': >-
  Hearing the excellent thunder of his roar as he bellowed, the tiger-like
  rākṣasas dwelling in Laṅkā were unable to stir anywhere.
'48': >-
  Having bowed to the ocean, Māruti of dreadful prowess—scorcher of
  foes—resolved upon that supreme deed for Rāghava’s sake.
'49': >-
  Raising his tail like a serpent, bending his back, drawing in his ears, and
  opening wide his mouth like the Mare’s-mouth fire, he leapt up into the sky
  with tremendous speed.
'50': >-
  With the rush of his swiftness he carried away fragments of trees, mountains,
  rocks, and ordinary vanaras too; driven onward by the force that surged from
  his arms and thighs, those (caught up) fell into the waters when their
  momentum failed.
'51': >-
  Extending his arms like the coils of a great serpent—his valor like that of
  the lord of serpents—Vāyu’s son went forth toward the supreme mountain, as
  though dragging the directions by sheer force.
'52': >-
  He looked upon the ocean with its whirling garlands of waves, its waters
  churning and confusing all creatures within; and suddenly sped on—like the
  discus loosed from Viṣṇu’s hand.
'53': >-
  Beholding mountains, flocks of birds, lakes, rivers, tanks, and splendid
  cities; and seeing also luxuriant forests dark with thick collyrium-hue, he
  went on at speed, swift as his sire.
'54': >-
  Keeping to the path of the sun, that hero Hanūmān—tireless, hurried, and equal
  to his father in prowess—went onward.
'55': >-
  Endowed with great swiftness, Māruti—moving with the speed of the wind—went,
  tiger among vanaras, making the directions resound with his noise.
'56': >-
  Remembering Jāmbavān’s words, Māruti of dreadful valor, that great monkey,
  suddenly beheld Himavant.
'57': >-
  Adorned with many cascades, with numerous caves and springs; beautified by
  lovely peaks like masses of white clouds; and graced with diverse trees—he
  reached that foremost mountain.
'58': >-
  Coming to that mighty lord of mountains, with exceedingly vast and excellent
  golden peaks, he saw holy great hermitages, frequented by the best assemblies
  of divine seers.
'59': >-
  He saw Brahmā’s treasury, the Silver Abode, Indra’s abode, and the place where
  Rudra lets fly his arrows; he saw Hayānana and the blazing Brahmaśiras weapon,
  and also the attendants of Vaivasvata (Yama).
'60': >-
  He saw Agni’s abode, Kubera’s abode, the radiant dwelling of the Sun, and the
  place where the Sun is bound; he saw Brahmā’s abode, Śaṅkara’s bow, and also
  the navel-like center of the earth.
'61': >-
  He beheld lofty Kailāsa, and the rock of Himavant; he saw that excellent
  golden mountain, the bull-like peak, blazing with the blaze of all medicinal
  herbs—the sovereign mountain of herbs.
'62': >-
  Seeing it, glowing like a heap of fire, the son of the messenger of Vāsava
  (Indra)—marvelled; and, leaping upon that kingly mountain of herbs, he set
  about collecting the herbs.
'63': >-
  Crossing over thousands of yojanas, that great monkey, son of the Wind, ranged
  about upon that mountain which bore the divine herbs.
'64': >-
  Then all the great medicinal herbs upon that best of mountains, knowing that a
  seeker had come for them, thereupon became invisible.
'65': >-
  Not seeing them, the great-souled Hanūmān grew furious; in wrath he roared
  mightily. Unable to endure it, his eyes like fire, he addressed that lord of
  mountains with these words.
'66': >-
  “What is this that you have thus firmly resolved—that you show no compassion
  toward Rāghava? Behold now, O king of mountains, how, overcome by the strength
  of my arms, you shall be scattered!”
'67': >-
  Seizing in speed its peak along with its woods and creatures, golden,
  frequented by thousands of minerals, with its summit torn and its ridges
  blazing—he uprooted it at once.
'68': >-
  Uprooting it, he sprang up into the sky, terrifying all worlds with their
  lords of devas and asuras. Praised by many sky-ranging beings, he went with
  the fierce speed of Garuḍa.
'69': >-
  Moving along the sun’s path, and bearing that sun-bright peak in his grasp, he
  then shone like the Sun himself—near the Sun, appearing as though a second
  sun.
'70': >-
  With that mountain he shone exceedingly—the son of the Wind like a mountain
  bearing a thousand streams, and like Viṣṇu in the sky holding the flaming
  discus that was set upon his hand.
'71': >-
  Seeing him then, the vanaras shouted aloud; seeing them, he too roared in joy.
  Hearing the uproar of their exalted cries, the Laṅkā-dwellers raised an even
  more dreadful clamor.
'72': >-
  Then the great-souled one alighted upon that best of mountains amidst the
  vanara army; bowing his head to the foremost of vanaras, he there embraced
  Vibhīṣaṇa as well.
'73': >-
  And those two princes of the lord of men (Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa), smelling the
  fragrance of the great medicinal herbs, then became at that very moment free
  of the shafts; and the other foremost heroes among vanaras arose as well.
'74': >-
  All the chief vanara warriors, in an instant, became free of arrows and free
  of pain—even those who had been slain—awakened by the fragrance of those
  excellent herbs, like sleepers roused at dawn’s end.
'75': >-
  From the time when the vanaras and rākṣasas began fighting in Laṅkā, from that
  time onward, in order to uphold honor, and by the command of Rāvaṇa,
'76': >-
  whatever rākṣasas were slain there in battle by the ape-elephants (mighty
  vanaras), all of them, when slain, were swiftly cast into the ocean.
'77': >-
  Then that vanara, the son of the Wind, bearing the mountain of herbs with
  towering speed, carried it back swiftly to Himavant itself, and again came to
  Rāma.
'78': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-fourth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, called “The Bringing of the Mountain of
  Medicinal Herbs.”
