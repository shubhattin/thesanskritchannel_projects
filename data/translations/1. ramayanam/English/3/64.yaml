  Now begins the sixty-fourth canto, named “Rama’s Wrath,” in the Aranya Kanda
  of the holy Valmiki-Ramayana.
'1': >-
  Then Rama, overcome with distress, spoke to Lakshmana in a voice laden with
  sorrow: “Go quickly, Lakshmana, and find out—go to the river Godavari.”
'2': >-
  “Has Sita perhaps gone to the Godavari to gather lotuses?” Thus addressed by
  Rama, Lakshmana once again—indeed—
'3': >-
  went to the delightful river Godavari, swift in action. Having searched along
  that sacred, ford-filled river, Lakshmana spoke to Rama:
'4': >-
  “I do not see her at the bathing-places, nor does she hear my calling. To what
  place, then, has Vaidehi—she who removes distress—gone?”
'5': >-
  “Indeed, O Rama, I do not know where that slender-waisted lady is.” Hearing
  Lakshmana’s words, Rama, dejected and bewildered with burning grief,
'6': >-
  went himself to the river Godavari. Approaching it, Rama spoke again and
  again: “Where is Sita?”
'7': >-
  Though beings there knew she had been carried off by the lord of
  rakshasas—worthy to be slain—neither those beings nor the river Godavari
  revealed her to Rama.
'8': >-
  Then, urged by those beings, the river seemed as though it would tell him,
  “She is your beloved”; yet when questioned by Rama in his sorrow, it did not
  speak of Sita.
'9': >-
  Having reflected on Ravana’s form and also the evil-souled deed he had done,
  the river, out of fear, did not disclose Vaidehi.
'10': >-
  Made hopeless by that river regarding the sight of Sita, Rama—worn down by
  longing to see her—said to Saumitri (Lakshmana):
'11': >-
  “This Godavari, gentle one, speaks nothing at all. What shall I say,
  Lakshmana, when I meet Janaka?”
'12': >-
  “And what shall I say to Vaidehi’s mother, when I return without her—she who
  was dear to me—while I, deprived of my kingdom, dwell in the forest and live
  on fare of the wilderness?”
'13': >-
  “She used to drive away all my grief; where then has Vaidehi gone? I am
  without my kin, and now I do not even behold Vaidehi.”
'14': >-
  “I think the nights will be long for me as I lie awake—here at Mandakini, in
  this Janasthana, on this mountain of Prasravana.”
'15': >-
  “I shall search through everything, if only Sita can be found. These great
  deer, O hero, keep looking at me again and again,”
'16': >-
  “as though wishing to speak; for I observe their gestures.” Seeing them, the
  tiger among men, Raghava, addressed them:
'17': >-
  Gazing about and asking, “Where is Sita?” with speech choked by tears—when
  thus spoken to by the lord among men, those deer rose at once,
'18': >-
  all turning southward, indicating the region of the sky. As Maithili was being
  carried away, she had taken to that direction.
'19': >-
  Going by that path, they kept looking back at the king of men; by that very
  way they showed the route and the ground, those deer.
'20': >-
  Again they went on, bellowing, and Lakshmana took note of them. Rama
  understood the whole import of their “speech” in their signs.
'21': >-
  Then the wise Lakshmana spoke to his elder brother with anguish: “When you
  asked, ‘Where is Sita?’ these deer sprang up at once,
'22': >-
  and they point to the earth and also toward the southern quarter. Come, O
  lord, let us go in this direction—the south-western (nairriti) quarter.
'23': >-
  “If there is any trace of that noble lady’s coming or going to be seen there…”
  “So be it,” said Kakutstha, and set out toward the southern direction,
'24': >-
  the illustrious Rama followed by Lakshmana, scanning the ground. Thus
  conversing with each other, the two brothers,
'25': >-
  saw upon the earth a path strewn with fallen flowers; and seeing that shower
  of flowers that had dropped on the ground, Rama—
'26': >-
  the hero, afflicted, spoke to afflicted Lakshmana these words: “I recognize
  these flowers here, Lakshmana—these very ones.
'27': >-
  They were tied on by Vaidehi—given by me in the woodland. I think the sun and
  the wind and the glorious earth itself,
'28': >-
  protect these flowers, intent on doing what is dear to me.” Having spoken
  thus, the mighty-armed Rama, to Lakshmana, bull among men,
'29': >-
  the righteous-souled Rama then spoke to the mountain abounding in cascades of
  Prasravana: “O lord of mountains, have you seen that lady of perfect beauty in
  every limb?
'30': >-
  “Sita has been separated from me by you in this lovely region of the forest!”
  In his anger he spoke to the mountain there, like a lion to a petty deer:
'31': >-
  “Show me Sita—golden-hued, golden-limbed—O mountain, or I shall destroy all
  your peaks and ridges!”
'32': >-
  Thus addressed by Rama, the mountain—toward Maithili—seemed as if indicating
  her, yet it did not show Sita to Raghava.
'33': >-
  Then Dasharathi Rama said to that rocky mass: “Burned by the fire of my
  arrows, you shall become ashes!
'34': >-
  You shall be unfit for resort on every side, stripped of grass, trees, and
  tender shoots; and this river too, today, I shall dry up, Lakshmana,
'35': >-
  if it does not tell me today of Sita, whose face is like the moon.” Thus
  enraged, Rama—his gaze as though set to burn—
'36': >-
  saw upon the ground the great footprint of a rakshasa, and also the marks of
  that terrified lady, longing for Rama, running to and fro,
'37': >-
  and the tracks of Vaidehi pursued by the rakshasa. Having examined the
  circling, confused traces of Sita and of the rakshasa,
'38': >-
  and seeing a bow broken, and a quiver, and a chariot shattered and strewn in
  many pieces, Rama’s heart was thrown into turmoil; he told his beloved
  brother:
'39': >-
  “See, Lakshmana—here are scattered the golden drops (beads) of Vaidehi’s
  ornaments, O Saumitri, and garlands of various kinds as well.
'40': >-
  And see, O Saumitri—the entire ground is covered everywhere with variegated
  drops resembling heated beads, like drops of blood.
'41': >-
  “I think, Lakshmana, Vaidehi—by rakshasas who can assume any form—has been
  torn again and again, or cut apart, or even devoured.”
'42': >-
  “And because of Sita, between two who were contending, there occurred here, O
  Saumitri, a terrible battle between two rakshasas.”
'43': >-
  “This delightful bow—adorned, inlaid with pearls and gems—lies broken on the
  ground, gentle one. Whose great bow is this, shattered?
'44': >-
  Is it of rakshasas, dear boy, or of the gods? This armour, bright like the
  rising sun, studded with cat’s-eye gems,
'45': >-
  torn apart and fallen on the earth—whose golden cuirass is it? And this
  umbrella with a hundred ribs, beautified with divine garlands—
'46': >-
  its staff broken—gentle one—whose is it that lies cast down on the ground? And
  these golden breast-plates with grotesque, goblin-like faces—hard—
'47': >-
  of dreadful shape and huge of body—by whom were they slain in battle? And this
  splendid battle-standard, radiant like a blazing fire—
'48': >-
  and this chariot of war, hurled aside and broken—whose is it? These arrows, as
  thick as a chariot-axle, ornamented with burnished gold—
'49': >-
  whose are these, slain (spent) and scattered, terrible to behold? See,
  Lakshmana—two quivers full of arrows lie smashed.”
'50': >-
  “This charioteer—killed—holding goad and whip: whose is he? This track is of a
  man, and plainly it is of some rakshasa as well.
'51': >-
  “Behold, gentle one, my enmity increased a hundredfold—brought to my very
  life’s end—by those rakshasas, fierce of heart, who can assume any form.
'52': >-
  Vaidehi has been carried off, or she is dead, or that ascetic lady has been
  devoured. Dharma does not protect Sita as she is being borne away in the great
  forest.
'53': >-
  For if Vaidehi has been devoured, or even if she has been carried off,
  Lakshmana—who in the world will be able, gentle one, to do what is pleasing to
  me—those very gods?
'54': >-
  All beings, through ignorance, would hold in contempt even the maker of the
  worlds—heroic and knowing compassion—O Lakshmana.
'55': >-
  “Gentle, devoted to the welfare of the world, self-controlled, knowing
  compassion—such a one, the lords of the gods surely think me to be without
  strength.
'56': >-
  See, Lakshmana—having attained me, virtue has turned into fault. Today indeed,
  for the ruin of all beings and for the destruction of the rakshasas,
'57': >-
  my fiery power shall blaze forth—like the great sun risen after withdrawing
  the moonlight; withdrawing all my qualities (restraints), my splendour shines.
'58': >-
  Neither yakshas, nor gandharvas, nor pishachas, nor rakshasas, nor kinnaras,
  nor even humans shall obtain happiness, Lakshmana.
'59': >-
  “See, Lakshmana—the sky filled with my missiles and arrows. Today I shall make
  it impossible to traverse for those who move through the three worlds.
'60': >-
  I shall arrest the hosts of planets, drive away the moon; fire and wind and
  the sun’s radiance shall be thrown into confusion and covered over.
'61': >-
  Mountain-peaks shall be churned and crushed; reservoirs shall dry up; trees,
  creepers, and thickets shall be laid waste; the ocean itself shall be
  destroyed.
'62': >-
  The three worlds I shall make united with the work of Time (universal
  dissolution), if they—those lords—do not give me back Sita, safe and well.
'63': >-
  This very moment, Saumitri, they shall behold my prowess. No beings shall leap
  into the sky, Lakshmana.
'64': >-
  With the continuous nets of my arrows, released from the strength of my bow,
  and with my iron shafts, the world shall be crushed—its beasts and birds
  scattered and destroyed in confusion.
'65': >-
  Behold today, Lakshmana, the world made tumultuous and lawless, smitten with
  arrows drawn to the ear—hard for living beings to evade.
'66': >-
  For Maithili’s sake I shall make it a realm without pishachas and rakshasas.
  The gods shall see today the might of my shafts,
'67': >-
  released in wrath, far-flying. Neither gods nor daityas nor pishachas nor
  rakshasas,
'68': >-
  shall survive my anger when the three worlds are brought to ruin. The worlds
  of gods, danavas, and yakshas, and those of the rakshasas too,
'69': >-
  shall fall in many ways, shattered to fragments by torrents of arrows. Today
  with my missiles I shall make these worlds without bounds or order.
'70': >-
  If they do not give back to me, Saumitri, that beloved Vaidehi—whether carried
  away or dead—if they do not give back that very Sita, so dear to me,
'71': >-
  then I will destroy the entire universe—the three worlds with all that moves
  and does not move—until I behold her; and with my arrows I shall scorch them.
'72': >-
  Having spoken thus, his eyes reddened with wrath and his lips quivering, he
  tied fast his bark-garment and antelope-skin, and bound up the burden of his
  matted locks.
'73': >-
  For that enraged Rama, thus become terrible, the body of that wise one looked
  like Rudra of old when he destroyed Tripura.
'74': >-
  Then Rama took his bow from Lakshmana and pressed it tight; and taking a
  blazing, dreadful arrow like a terrible serpent,
'75': >-
  the illustrious Rama, conqueror of enemy-citadels, fixed it upon his bow.
  Furious like the fire at the end of an age, he spoke these words:
'76': >-
  “Just as old age, just as death, just as Time, just as destiny are never
  turned back among all beings, Lakshmana—so I too, joined with wrath, am not to
  be restrained, without doubt.
'77': >-
  “If they do not show me today that Maithili—my faultless, sweet-spoken
  Sita—then I shall overturn the world, with its gods, gandharvas, humans, and
  serpents, and with its mountains.”
'78': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fourth canto, named “Rama’s Wrath,” in the Aranya Kanda of
  the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, the primeval epic.
