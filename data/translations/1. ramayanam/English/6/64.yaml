  Now begins the sixty-fourth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Means of Enticing Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Having heard the words spoken by the mighty Atikāya—powerful and
  strong-armed—Mahodara spoke in reply upon hearing the counsel of Kumbhakarṇa.
'2': >-
  “Kumbhakarṇa, though born in a noble lineage, you are impudent and of coarse
  perception; being arrogant, you are not able to discern what ought to be done
  in every matter.”
'3': >-
  “Indeed, Kumbhakarṇa, the king does not fail to understand what is policy and
  what is not; but you, audacious from boyhood, merely wish to speak.”
'4': >-
  “He—the bull among rākṣasas—knows what is proper station, what leads to
  increase, and what brings decline; he understands the ordering of place and
  time, for himself as well as for others.”
'5': >-
  “What an ordinary-minded man, though strong, is incapable of speaking; what
  man of discernment would attempt such a thing, having not served and learned
  from elders?”
'6': >-
  “And those aims of dharma, artha, and kāma which you speak of as resting on
  separate foundations—there is, by your very nature, no mark in you by which
  you can truly comprehend them.”
'7': >-
  “Action indeed is the purpose of all causes; and here the fruit of actions
  becomes either better or worse—bringing good or bringing sin.”
'8': >-
  “Dharma and artha both yield the fruit of highest blessedness; but as for
  adharma and what is devoid of meaning, the fruit attained is ruinous and
  brings calamity in its train.”
'9': >-
  “Actions are undertaken by men for benefit in this world and in the other
  world; and he who has set his mind on a desire also obtains auspicious results
  through his deeds.”
'10': >-
  “In this matter, what has been settled by the king is fixed in his heart, and
  it is also our view; for what is this rashness against the enemy—what, indeed,
  can be gained by it here?”
'11': >-
  “And as for the reason you have put forward for a single-handed expedition,
  even there I shall tell you what is improper and what does not hold good in
  your argument.”
'12': >-
  “By him, in former days at Jana-sthāna, many exceedingly strong rākṣasas were
  slain; how will you, alone, conquer that Rāghava?”
'13': >-
  “Those powerful rākṣasas who were earlier defeated by him at Jana-sthāna—you
  do not see all of them today in the city, frightened as they are.”
'14': >-
  “You wish to awaken Rāma, Daśaratha’s son, enraged like a lion, as though he
  were a sleeping serpent, thinking him to be asleep!”
'15': >-
  “Ever blazing with his splendour, and hard to approach because of his
  wrath—who is fit to go up against him, unbearable like Death itself?”
'16': >-
  “All this is uncertain in the matter of confronting the enemy; the going of
  one alone, dear friend, is in no way pleasing to me at all.”
'17': >-
  “Who, lacking advantage, would wish to bring under control a prosperous foe as
  though he were some ordinary man—certainly at the cost of laying down his own
  life?”
'18': >-
  “O foremost of rākṣasas, for whom there is no equal among men—how do you hope
  to fight one who is the peer of Indra and the Sun?”
'19': >-
  Having thus spoken to the enraged Kumbhakarṇa, Mahodara then addressed
  Rāvaṇa—he whose roar resounded through the worlds—amidst the rākṣasas.
'20': >-
  “Having obtained Vaidehī here before you, for what purpose do you delay? If
  you so desire, then Sītā will come under your control.”
'21': >-
  “A certain plan has been found by me that will bring about Sītā’s attendance;
  if it seems good to your own understanding, O lord of rākṣasas, then hear it.”
'22': >-
  “Let it be proclaimed: ‘I, Dvijihva, and Saṁhrādi, Kumbhakarṇa, and
  Vitardana—these five are setting out to slay Rāma.’”
'23': >-
  “Then, having gone forth, we shall earnestly give him battle; if we conquer
  your enemies, then there will be no need for stratagem on our part.”
'24': >-
  “But if our enemy yet lives, and we have engaged in combat, then we shall
  proceed according to what has been resolved in our minds.”
'25': >-
  “We shall return here from battle smeared with blood, our own bodies torn by
  arrows—shafts bearing the mark of Rāma’s name.”
'26': >-
  “Proclaiming, ‘Rāghava has been devoured by us, and Lakṣmaṇa too,’ then we
  shall seize your feet; fulfill for us our desire.”
'27': >-
  “Then, O king, cause proclamation to be made in the city from the back of an
  elephant, everywhere: ‘Rāma has been slain, together with his brother and his
  entire army.’”
'28': >-
  “Then, being pleased with your servants, O subduer of enemies, grant them
  enjoyments and attendants, desired objects, and wealth.”
'29': >-
  “Then give garlands and garments, and unguents for the heroes, and abundant
  drink to the warriors—and you yourself, rejoicing, drink.”
'30': >-
  “Then, when this noble report has spread widely in every direction—when it is
  famed that ‘Rāma, together with his friends, has been devoured by the
  rākṣasas’—”
'31': >-
  “Enter, and also reassure Sītā in secret, consoling her; entice her with
  riches and grains, with objects of desire, and with jewels.”
'32': >-
  “By this stratagem, O king—renewed and bound up again with sorrow—Sītā,
  unwilling though she is, bereft of her protector, will come under your power.”
'33': >-
  “Having learned that her delightful lord has perished, through despair and
  through the frailty of womanhood, she will submit to your control.”
'34': >-
  “Reared earlier in happiness, deserving of happiness, now worn down by
  sorrow—knowing that happiness depends upon you, she will come to you in every
  way.”
'35': >-
  “This counsel of mine is well-guided in my judgment: for merely by seeing
  Rāma, misfortune would arise. Here itself for you, without anxiety, will
  success be accomplished; and without a great battle will the gaining of
  happiness be secured.”
'36': >-
  “For a king, O lord of men—while his army remains unharmed and doubt has not
  arisen—by conquering the enemy without fighting, he attains great renown and
  merit, and enjoys prosperity and fame for a long time.”
'37': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fourth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, named “The Means of Enticing Sītā.”
