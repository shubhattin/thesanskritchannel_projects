  Having spoken thus, and praising the Kakutstha again and again, the delight of
  the Raghu race once more addressed him with yet another word.
'2': >-
  “Here are four thousand horses, O best of men; two thousand chariots, and a
  hundred excellent elephants.
'3': >-
  “Let the market-streets in between, splendid with wares of many kinds, follow
  the Kakutstha; and likewise let actors and dancers also accompany him.
'4': >-
  “Taking a niyuta of gold and fine gold, O best of men, go forth, Śatrughna,
  with vehicles sufficient to carry abundant wealth.
'5': >-
  “And take with you an army that is well-maintained, O hero—cheerful,
  well-nourished, and not insolent. By kindly speech and by gifts, delight them,
  O foremost among men.
'6': >-
  “For there, wealth does not remain, nor wives, nor kinsmen; but wherever you,
  O Rāghava, abide, a company of servants remains well-pleased.”

  Then, having dispatched the great host, crowded with joyous people, he said:
  “You alone, bow in hand, go to the forest of Madhu.
'8': >-
  “Go in such a way that he does not recognize you as one advancing, desirous of
  battle; thus may you approach without apprehension—(for) Lavaṇa is the son of
  Madhu.
'9': >-
  “For there is no other death for him, O best of men: whoever goes to meet him
  in his presence, that man is surely slain by Lavaṇa.
'10': >-
  “When the heat of summer has departed and the nights of the rainy season have
  arrived, then you should slay Lavaṇa, O gentle one; for that is the time for
  this evil-minded man.”
'11': >-
  “Let your soldiers proceed, placing the great Ṛṣis in the forefront, so that,
  with the remnant of summer, they may cross the waters of the Jāhnavī (Gaṅgā).”
'12': >-
  “There, having stationed the entire force upon the river-bank, self-possessed,
  go on ahead with your bow—swift in valor.”
'13': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, Śatrughna, of great might, assembled those powerful
  leaders at the head of the army, and then spoke these words:
'14': >-
  “These are the quarters allotted to you; wherever it may be, there you shall
  dwell. And you must remain without opposition, so that there may be no trouble
  to anyone.”
'15': >-
  Having thus instructed them, and having set forth that great force, he paid
  reverence to Kauśalyā, to Sumitrā, and to Kaikeyī.
'16': >-
  Having circumambulated Rāma and bowed to him with his head, and having
  obtained Rāma’s permission, Śatrughna—the tormentor of foes—(prepared to
  depart).
'17': >-
  With joined palms, he prostrated himself before Lakṣmaṇa and Bharata, and also
  before the family priest Vasiṣṭha. Then Śatrughna, self-restrained and of
  great might, having circumambulated them, went forth.
'18': >-
  After dispatching the army then, dense with the foremost streams of lordly
  elephants and excellent horses, he dwelt for a month at the side of the king;
  thereafter the enhancer of the Raghu line set out.
'19': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fourth chapter of the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Departure of Śatrughna.”
