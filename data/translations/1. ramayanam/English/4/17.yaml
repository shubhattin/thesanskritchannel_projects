  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the
  seventeenth chapter, named “Rāma’s Censure (Accusation against Rāma).”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, struck by Rāma’s arrow, Vālī—fierce and harsh in battle—fell
  suddenly, like a tree cut down at its base.
'2': >-
  With all his limbs laid upon the earth, adorned with ornaments of heated gold,
  he sank down like the banner of the king of the gods, its cords loosened.
'3': >-
  When the lord of the troops of monkeys and bears had fallen to the ground, the
  earth no longer shone—like the sky when the moon has vanished.
'4': >-
  Even though that great-souled one had fallen upon the earth, neither fortune
  left his body, nor did his life-breath depart, nor his splendour, nor his
  valour.
'5': >-
  A golden garland, wondrous and gem-adorned, bestowed by Śakra (Indra),
  sustained the chief of monkeys—preserving his life, his splendour, and his
  royal radiance.
'6': >-
  And that hero, the leader of the monkey-host, with that golden garland upon
  him, appeared like a cloud at the edge of evening, suffused with twilight.
'7': >-
  His garland, his body, and the vital-smiting arrow—these three together
  formed, as it were, a triple splendour; even fallen, he still shone.
'8': >-
  That missile of that warrior—making its power felt upon the path to
  heaven—discharged from Rāma’s bow, brought him to the supreme state.
'9': >-
  Thus fallen in battle, he lay like a fire whose blaze has gone out—like
  Yayāti, when his merit is exhausted, fallen here from the world of the gods.
'10': >-
  Like the sun cast down to the earth at the end of an age by Time; like great
  Indra, hard to assail; like Upendra (Viṣṇu), difficult to endure—so did he
  lie.
'11': >-
  Vālin, the son of Mahendra (Indra), fallen, wearing a golden
  garland—broad-chested, mighty-armed, with a radiant face and tawny eyes.
'12': >-
  Rāma, attended by Lakṣmaṇa, beheld him and drew near—him, the fallen hero,
  like a fire whose flame is quenched.
'13': >-
  Honouring that hero, and gazing upon him as if slowly and with deliberation,
  the two brothers of great prowess—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—approached.
'14': >-
  Seeing Rāghava and Lakṣmaṇa of great strength, Vālī spoke harsh words—yet
  uttered in humility and consonant with dharma.
'15': >-
  Lying on the ground, his life-force dimmed, struck down and bereft of clear
  consciousness, he addressed the proud one—elated with the arrogance of
  battle—with speech full of meaning.
'16': >-
  “You are the son of a king, famed, and pleasing to behold. Having slain one
  who faced away, what merit have you gained by this—since I, engaged in the
  fury of combat, have met death on your account?”
'17': >-
  “Noble-born, possessed of virtue, radiant, steadfast in conduct—Rāma is
  compassionate and devoted to the welfare of his subjects.”
'18': >-
  “Kindly, of great energy, knowing the proper time and circumstance, firm in
  vow—thus do all beings proclaim your fame upon the earth.”
'19': >-
  “Self-restraint, tranquility, forgiveness, righteousness, fortitude, truth,
  and prowess—these are the qualities of kings, O ruler; and punishment too for
  those who do harm.”
'20': >-
  “Considering those qualities, and your eminent lineage, I—though restrained by
  Tārā—joined battle with Sugrīva.”
'21': >-
  “It did not seem to me that you should pierce me with a weapon when I was
  intent on another, heedless, and engaged with someone else—such was the
  thought that arose in me, upon seeing you.”
'22': >-
  “But now I know you as one with a banner of dharma yet adharma in deed—of
  sinful conduct—like a well covered over with grass.”
'23': >-
  “A sin wearing the guise of the righteous, like fire concealed— I do not
  recognize you as you truly are, being veiled by a counterfeit of dharma.”
'24': >-
  “If, in your realm or in your city, I were committing some sin—and I did not
  disregard you—why then would you slay me, as though I were guilty?”
'25': >-
  “A monkey, ranging the forest, ever eating fruits and roots—me, here, not
  fighting you, but met in combat with another—(how could you strike down)?”
'26': >-
  “You are the son of a king, well-known, fair to behold; and even the marks of
  kingship are in you, O ruler, and are seen to be aligned with dharma.”
'27': >-
  “Who, born in a kṣatriya lineage, learned, and free from doubt—would, hidden
  beneath the insignia of dharma, perform a cruel deed?”
'28': >-
  “You are born in the line of Rāghava and renowned as righteous. Why do you run
  about with the form of one fit and noble, while being unworthy within?”
'29': >-
  “Conciliation, gifts, forbearance, righteousness, truth, fortitude and
  prowess—these are the qualities of kings, O ruler; and punishment too for
  wrong-doers.”
'30': >-
  “We, Rāma, are forest-dwellers—beasts that eat roots and fruits. This is our
  nature; but you are a man, O lord of men.”
'31': >-
  “Land, gold, and beauty, and the causes of enmity—these are matters for men.
  What greed have you in the forest for these, or for my fruits?”
'32': >-
  “Policy and humility—both; restraint and favour—both: the conduct of kings is
  not confused. Kings are not to act according to mere desire.”
'33': >-
  “But you are desire-driven, prone to anger, and unsteady; confused in royal
  conduct, you are one who relies on bow and arrows.”
'34': >-
  “You have no reverence for dharma, no settled understanding of artha; governed
  by the senses and moving in the ways of desire, you are being dragged along, O
  lord among men.”
'35': >-
  “Having slain me here with an arrow, though I am without offence, what will
  you say amid the virtuous, after doing a deed that is shameful?”
'36': >-
  “A slayer of a king, a slayer of a brahmin, a killer of a cow, a thief, one
  who delights in killing creatures, an atheist, and one who violates the
  marriage-bed—all these go to hell.”
'37': >-
  “An informer, a miser, a killer of friends, one who violates the teacher’s
  bed—these too go to the realm of sinful-souled men; of this there is no
  doubt.”
'38': >-
  “My hide is not to be accepted by the good, nor my hairs or bones; and my
  flesh too is not to be eaten by dharma-walking men such as you.”
'39': >-
  “Five five-clawed creatures are deemed fit to be eaten by brahmins and
  kṣatriyas, O Rāghava: the porcupine, the hedgehog, the iguana, the hare, and
  as the fifth, the tortoise.”
'40': >-
  “But my hide and my bones, O Rāma, are not touched by the wise; and my flesh
  too is forbidden—yet I, a five-clawed creature, have been slain.”
'41': >-
  “Tārā spoke words to me—true, wholesome, and from one who knows all—yet
  transgressing them through delusion, I came under the power of Time.”
'42': >-
  “With you as protector, O Kakutstha, the earth should not be without
  protection—nor a virtuous woman of perfect conduct be (abandoned) by her
  husband through unrighteousness.”
'43': >-
  “Deceitful, unscrupulous, base—whose mind bends to false humility—how were
  you, a sinner, born of the great-souled Daśaratha?”
'44': >-
  “By one who has cut through the bounds of good conduct, who oversteps the
  dharma of the virtuous, who has cast away the goad of dharma—I have been slain
  by Rāma’s hand.”
'45': >-
  “Inauspicious, improper, and censured by the good—will you speak and justify
  such a deed, once you come together with the righteous?”
'46': >-
  “This prowess of yours has been displayed against us who were indifferent (not
  confronting you). Against those who do harm to you, O Rāma, I do not see such
  prowess.”
'47': >-
  “Had you fought me openly, visible on the battlefield, O prince, today—slain
  by me—you would have beheld Vaivasvata, the god of death.”
'48': >-
  “But by you, unseen in battle, I—hard to approach—have been slain, like a man
  who, fallen under the sway of sin, is bitten by a serpent while asleep.”
'49': >-
  “If I was slain by you out of a desire to please Sugrīva—had you earlier urged
  me to this purpose (openly), in a single day I would have brought Maithilī to
  you.”
'50': >-
  “And that wicked-souled rākṣasa, the abductor of your wife—having bound him by
  the neck, I would have delivered to you Rāvaṇa, un-slain in battle.”
'51': >-
  “Whether Maithilī had been cast into the waters of the ocean, or even into the
  netherworld, I would have brought her back by your command—like a white mare
  (brought forth from the deep).”
'52': >-
  “It is proper that Sugrīva should obtain the kingdom when I have gone to
  heaven; but it is improper that I have been slain by you in battle through
  adharma.”
'53': >-
  “Indeed, such is the world: by Time it is disposed in this manner. If it be
  right that you should offer an answer, let that reply be well considered.”
'54': >-
  Having spoken thus, his mouth parched, that great-souled one, pained by the
  blow of the arrows, looked upon Rāma—splendid like the sun—and then fell
  silent: the son of the king of monkeys.
'55': >-
  Thus ends the seventeenth chapter, named “Rāma’s Censure,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the ancient, sacred, and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  first epic.
