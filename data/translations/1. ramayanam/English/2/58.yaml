  Now begins the Fifty-eighth Sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Account of Rāma’s Message.”
'1': >-
  When the king, having somewhat regained composure, returned again after his
  delusion, he then summoned that charioteer, Sumantra, to learn in full the
  inner particulars of what had happened concerning Rāma.
'2': >-
  Thereupon the charioteer came before the great king, standing with folded
  palms—while the king, overwhelmed with sorrow and grief, was lamenting for
  Rāma alone.
'3': >-
  He beheld the aged monarch exceedingly afflicted, like an elephant newly
  seized by a snare—sighing deeply, absorbed in thought, and unsteady, like a
  distressed tusker.
'4': >-
  Then the king spoke to Sumantra, who had come near with limbs smeared and
  soiled with dust, his face full of tears and his whole bearing
  dejected—speaking in a supremely anguished manner.
'5': >-
  “Where now will the righteous-souled one dwell, taking shelter at the root of
  a tree? O charioteer, is Rāghava wholly at ease there, or does anything
  afflict him?”
'6': >-
  “Sumantra, one who is unfit for sorrow is made to suffer sorrow; he who is
  worthy of a couch is laid upon the ground. How does the son of the protector
  of the earth lie on the bare earth like one without protection?”
'7': >-
  “He whom foot-soldiers, chariots, and elephants used to follow as he went—how
  will that Rāma now live, having resorted to a lonely forest?”
'8': >-
  “A forest roamed by fierce beasts and frequented by black serpents—how have
  the two princes reached such a place, together with Vaidehī?”
'9': >-
  “And with delicate Sītā, a woman of ascetic endurance—how did the royal
  princes go on foot after alighting from the chariot, O Sumantra?”
'10': >-
  “Surely you have achieved your purpose, charioteer, since you have seen my two
  sons, as they entered the depths of the forest—like the two Aśvins entering
  Mount Mandara.”
'11': >-
  “What words did Rāma speak, and what did Lakṣmaṇa speak? And when the forest
  was reached, what did Maithilī speak, Sumantra?”
'12': >-
  “Tell me, charioteer, of Rāma—what he sat upon, where he lay, and what he ate.
  By that account alone I shall sustain my life, even as Yayāti lived on among
  the righteous.”
'13': >-
  Thus urged by the lord of men, the charioteer, his voice faltering and choked
  with tears, spoke to the king with speech bound about by sobs.
'14': >-
  “He said to me, O great king, while ever upholding dharma: Rāghava, having
  folded his hands and bowing with his head, made reverent obeisance and spoke.”
'15': >-
  “‘Charioteer, by my word, convey to my father—who knows his own self—that the
  venerable feet of that great-souled one, worthy to be bowed to, are to be
  bowed to with the head.’”
'16': >-
  “‘And by my word, charioteer, speak to all within the inner apartments: convey
  my health without distinction, and render salutations as is fitting.’”
'17': >-
  “‘And tell my mother Kauśalyā of my welfare, offering my reverent salutations;
  and admonish her to be vigilant, and say to her these very words.’”
'18': >-
  “‘Ever steadfast in dharma, be devoted at the proper times to the sacred fire
  and to the household rites. O Devi, cherish the feet of your lord, guarding
  them as one would a god.’”
'19': >-
  “‘Casting away pride and self-importance, conduct yourself rightly among the
  mothers. And, my mother, serve the queen Kaikeyī in accordance with the king’s
  will.’”
'20': >-
  “‘Toward Prince Bharata, conduct yourself as toward a king. For kings are
  foremost in wealth and power; keep the duties of kingship ever in
  remembrance.’”
'21': >-
  “‘Bharata too is to be addressed with inquiries of welfare, by my message; and
  among all the mothers, live and conduct yourself in a manner that is just and
  according to propriety.’”
'22': >-
  “‘And the mighty-armed one, the delight of the Ikṣvāku line, is also to be
  addressed: “Though established as heir-apparent, attend upon your father as
  upon one established in sovereignty.”’”
'23': >-
  “‘Since the king is advanced in years, do not obstruct him. You, while living
  under the prince’s rule, let your conduct follow his command.’”
'24': >-
  “And again he said to me, shedding copious tears: ‘My mother is to you as your
  own mother—she who longs for her son; she must be seen (and comforted).’”
'25': >-
  Thus, O great king, while speaking in this manner, the illustrious
  Rāma—lotus-red of eyes—let fall a flood of tears.
'26': >-
  But Lakṣmaṇa, greatly enraged, sighing hard, spoke these words: “By what
  offense has this prince been exiled?”
'27': >-
  “Surely, through the king’s compliance with Kaikeyī and by taking lightly her
  directive, a deed has been done—whether right or wrong—by which we are
  oppressed.”
'28': >-
  “If Rāma has been banished, whether compelled by greed, or on account of a
  promised boon—by every reckoning an evil deed has been done.”
'29': >-
  “This, indeed, has been done to fulfill the will of one who claims lordship;
  but in abandoning Rāma I discern no reason at all.”
'30': >-
  “Undertaken without due deliberation, opposed to right judgment through
  weakness of understanding—this exile of Rāghava will surely give rise to a
  great outcry.”
'31': >-
  “For my part, O great king, I do not recognize fatherhood in this matter:
  Rāghava is my brother, my lord, my kinsman, and my father as well.”
'32': >-
  “Abandoning one who is dear to all the worlds, who is devoted to the welfare
  of all the worlds—how will all people remain attached to you after this act?”
'33': >-
  “Having exiled righteous Rāma, who is the delight of all subjects, how will
  you be king—having set yourself in opposition to all the world?”
'34': >-
  But Jānakī, O great king—sighing, and enduring like an ascetic—stood as though
  her mind were struck down by calamity, motionless and bereft of strength, as
  if crushed by misfortune.
'35': >-
  The illustrious princess, daughter of a king, who had never before known such
  calamity—though she wept under that sorrow, she spoke nothing at all to me.
'36': >-
  Looking toward her husband, her mouth drying up, she suddenly released tears
  when she saw me departing.
'37': >-
  And Rāma likewise stood with tear-filled face, hands joined in reverence,
  supported by Lakṣmaṇa’s arm; and Sītā likewise, weeping and steadfast like an
  ascetic, kept gazing—so too at the royal chariot, and so too at me.
'38': >-
  Thus ends the Fifty-eighth Sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Account of Rāma’s Message.”
