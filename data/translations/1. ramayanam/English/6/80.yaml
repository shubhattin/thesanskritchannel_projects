  Then, in the holy and glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins
  the eightieth chapter, entitled “The Battle with Rāvaṇi (Indrajit) Who Fought
  While Concealed (Invisible).”
'1': >-
  Hearing that Makarākṣa had been slain, Rāvaṇa, the conqueror of hostile
  hosts, was seized with violent wrath, and grinding his teeth together, became
  greatly inflamed with rage.
'2': >-
  And then, there on the spot, enraged and pondering, “What is to be done now?”,
  he angrily commanded his son Indrajit to go forth to battle.
'3': >-
  “Slay, O hero, those two brothers of mighty prowess—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. Whether
  you remain unseen or are seen, in every way you are superior in strength.”
'4': >-
  “You, whose deeds are without equal, conquer Indra himself in battle; how much
  more, then, on beholding mere men, will you not slay them in combat?”
'5': >-
  Thus addressed by the lord of the rākṣasas, Indrajit accepted his father’s
  command, and on the sacrificial ground he duly offered oblations into the fire
  according to rite.
'6': >-
  And while he was offering into the fire, rākṣasī women wearing red
  head-dresses came there in haste and agitation, to the place where Rāvaṇi was.
'7': >-
  They brought weapons, bundles of arrows, and bibhītaka firewood as kindling,
  as well as red garments, and also a ladle made of black iron.
'8': >-
  Having strewn the fire on all sides with bundles of arrows and with javelins,
  he seized by the throat a completely black goat, still alive.
'9': >-
  When the oblation-fed fire blazed up, smokeless and with great flames, those
  signs appeared there, displaying victory.
'10': >-
  Its flame curling to the right, and gleaming like heated gold, the fire—rising
  up of itself—accepted that offering.
'11': >-
  Having offered into the fire and then satisfied gods, dānavas, and rākṣasas
  with oblations, he mounted a splendid, best of chariots that had the power of
  concealment (to vanish from sight).
'12': >-
  That excellent chariot, equipped with four horses and furnished with sharp
  arrows, with his great bow set in place, shone forth resplendent.
'13': >-
  Blazing with bodily radiance, adorned with ornaments of refined gold, that
  chariot was decorated with figures of deer and of half-moons and full moons.
'14': >-
  Indrajit’s banner, with a great golden staff and blazing like a bright fire,
  was adorned with vaidūrya (cat’s-eye gemstone).
'15': >-
  Guarded by that brilliance like the sun and protected by the Brahmā-weapon,
  that immensely powerful Rāvaṇi became unassailable.
'16': >-
  Then Indrajit, the conqueror in battle, went forth from the city; and having
  offered into the fire with rākṣasa-mantras, he became concealed from sight and
  spoke.
'17': >-
  “Today, having slain in battle those two who falsely took to the life of
  ascetics in the forest, I shall grant victory—surpassing all others in
  battle—to my father Rāvaṇa.”
'18': >-
  “Today, having made the earth free of vānaras, and having slain Rāma and
  Lakṣmaṇa, I shall cause the highest delight.” Thus saying, he vanished from
  view.
'19': >-
  Urged on by the ten-necked Rāvaṇa, Indra’s foe (Indrajit) rushed down in fury,
  fierce in battle, armed with sharp bows and keen iron arrows.
'20': >-
  He beheld the two mighty heroes amid the vānaras, sending forth nets of
  arrows—like two three-headed serpents.
'21': >-
  Thinking, “These indeed are they,” he strung his bow and poured forth an
  unbroken stream of arrows, like a rain-cloud raining down.
'22': >-
  Mounted on his aerial chariot, standing in battle beyond the range of sight,
  he pierced Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa with sharp arrows.
'23': >-
  Encircled by the force of his arrows, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, taking their bows
  with arrows in hand, set in motion a divine weapon.
'24': >-
  Those two of great strength, covering the sky with networks of arrows,
  nevertheless did not touch him with their arrows—though their missiles shone
  like the sun.
'25': >-
  For he created smoke and darkness, covering the heavens; and the quarters
  disappeared, the illustrious one veiling them with mist and gloom.
'26': >-
  Neither the loud twang of the bowstring nor the sound of wheel-rims or hooves
  was heard as he moved, nor did his form become visible.
'27': >-
  In that thick darkness and black night, he—mighty-armed—rained down,
  wondrously, a downpour as though of stones, by showers of iron arrows and
  shafts.
'28': >-
  Then, enraged in battle, Rāvaṇi, with boons-gifted arrows shining like the
  sun, pierced Rāma fiercely in every limb.
'29': >-
  While the two tiger-like men were being struck by torrents of iron arrows like
  two mountains beneath cascading streams, they let fly sharp shafts with golden
  feathers.
'30': >-
  Reaching Rāvaṇi in the mid-sky, those arrows, feathered like herons, cut him
  down; and, blood-smeared, they fell to the earth.
'31': >-
  As the two best of men blazed exceedingly amid that mass of arrows, they
  severed the falling missiles with many broad-headed shafts.
'32': >-
  Wherever those well-aimed arrows were seen to be falling from, there the two
  sons of Daśaratha launched their supreme weapon.
'33': >-
  But Rāvaṇi, an atiratha, swept in his chariot through all directions, and he
  pierced the two sons of Daśaratha with swift weapons—sharp arrows.
'34': >-
  Those two heroes, sorely wounded by his well-knit arrows with golden feathers,
  the sons of Daśaratha, appeared like two blossoming kiṃśuka trees.
'35': >-
  No one could discern his speed or course—nor his form, nor his bow, nor his
  arrows—just as, when the sun is covered by clouds, nothing is clearly known.
'36': >-
  And the vānaras too, pierced by him and struck down, bereft of life, fell
  there in hundreds upon the face of the earth.
'37': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, enraged, spoke these words to his brother: “I shall employ the
  Brahmā-weapon for the slaying of all the rākṣasas.”
'38': >-
  Then Rāma said to Lakṣmaṇa of auspicious marks: “For the sake of one, you
  should not slay the rākṣasas upon the earth.”
'39': >-
  “One who does not fight, who is concealed, who comes with joined palms seeking
  refuge, who flees, or who is intoxicated—such a one you should not kill here.”
'40': >-
  “But for his very slaying I shall make the effort, O mighty-armed one; we
  shall discharge great-velocity weapons like deadly serpents.”
'41': >-
  “That deceitful and base rākṣasa, whose chariot is hidden from sight—when the
  vānaras’ leaders behold him—will, by force, be struck down.”
'42': >-
  “Whether he enters the earth, or ascends to heaven, or goes to Rasātala, or
  even to the vault of the sky—though he be thus concealed, scorched by my
  weapons he shall fall upon the earth, his life departed.”
'43': >-
  Having spoken these words of great import, the foremost hero of the Raghu
  line, surrounded by the bull-like vānaras, then—great-souled—swiftly looked
  about, intent on the destruction of that fierce one of cruel deeds.
'44': >-
  Thus ends the eightieth chapter in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primal epic, entitled “The Battle with Rāvaṇi (Indrajit) Who
  Fought While Concealed (Invisible).”
