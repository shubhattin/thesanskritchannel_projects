  Now begins the fifth canto in the Aranya-kanda of the glorious
  Valmiki-Ramayana, called “Sharabhanga’s Departure to the World of Brahma.”
'1': >-
  Having slain that rakshasa Viradha of dreadful might in the forest, the
  valiant Rama then embraced Sita and, having comforted and reassured her,
  (stood composed).
'2': >-
  Rama spoke to his brother Lakshmana of blazing splendour: “Hard indeed is this
  forest, difficult to traverse; and we are not (men) accustomed to roaming in
  the woods.”
'3': >-
  “Let us go quickly to Sharabhanga, that treasure-house of austerity.” Thus did
  Raghava proceed to the hermitage of Sharabhanga.
'4': >-
  Near Sharabhanga—whose spiritual power was divine, and whose self had been
  perfected by austerities—he beheld a great marvel.
'5': >-
  He saw, radiant in form, blazing like the sun and like the fire of
  Vaishvanara, a most excellent chariot stationed in the sky, attended by
  celestial beings.
'6': >-
  He beheld the Lord of the celestials, not touching the earth, a god
  resplendent with brilliance and ornaments, wearing spotless heavenly garments.
'7': >-
  That chariot, poised in mid-air, was honoured by many great-souled ones like
  himself; it was yoked to green (hari-coloured) horses.
'8': >-
  From afar he saw it gleaming like the newly risen sun, like a mass of pale
  clouds, and like the orb of the moon.
'9': >-
  He also saw a spotless parasol, adorned with wondrous garlands, and two
  excellent yak-tail fans with golden shafts, exceedingly valuable.
'10': >-
  They were held by noble women and waved over the head (of that deity).
  Gandharvas, gods, siddhas, and many supreme rishis were there,
'11': >-
  praising that god who was in the sky with their choicest hymns, while Vasava
  (Indra) conversed with Sharabhanga.
'12': >-
  Seeing Shatakratu (Indra) there, Rama spoke to Lakshmana; and Rama, pointing
  towards the chariot, showed that marvel to his brother.
'13': >-
  “Behold, Lakshmana, that wondrous chariot—radiant, endowed with
  prosperity—shining as though it were the sun blazing in the mid-heavens.”
'14': >-
  “Those horses of Puruhuta, of Shakra, of whom we have heard in former
  days—those very divine green horses are surely these, moving through the sky.”
'15': >-
  “And these, O tiger among men, who stand all around in every
  direction—hundreds upon hundreds—wearing earrings, youthful, with swords in
  their hands—”
'16': >-
  “broad and mighty in chest, their arms like iron bars, all clad in red-hued
  garments—like tigers, hard to approach.”
'17': >-
  “Upon the chests of them all are garlands shining like fire. They bear, O
  Saumitri, the appearance of (men of) five-and-twenty years.”
'18': >-
  “For this indeed, it is said, is ever the age of the gods—just as these tigers
  among men are seen, pleasing to behold.”
'19': >-
  “Remain here for a moment with Vaidehi, Lakshmana, while I clearly ascertain
  who this radiant one is upon the chariot.”
'20': >-
  Having thus spoken to Saumitri, saying, “Stay here,” Kakutstha advanced
  towards Sharabhanga’s hermitage.
'21': >-
  Then Shachipati (Indra), seeing Rama approaching, took leave of Sharabhanga
  and spoke these words to the celestials:
'22': >-
  “Here comes Rama. Until he speaks to me, lead (this chariot) away to its
  destination; thereafter he is worthy to behold me.”
'23': >-
  “For this man, victorious and fulfilled of purpose, will soon accomplish that
  great deed—difficult for others to perform.”
'24': >-
  Then the wielder of the thunderbolt, having addressed and honoured the
  ascetic, the subduer of foes departed to heaven in his horse-yoked chariot.
'25': >-
  When the thousand-eyed one had departed, Raghava—together with his attendants
  and equipment—approached Sharabhanga, who was engaged in the worship of the
  sacred fire.
'26': >-
  Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana took hold of his feet (in reverence); permitted by
  him, invited, and having obtained a place to dwell, they sat down.
'27': >-
  Thereupon Raghava inquired about Shakra’s coming; and Sharabhanga related all
  of that to Raghava.
'28': >-
  “This bestower of boons, Rama, desires to lead me to Brahma’s world—hard to
  attain for those without self-mastery—won by me through fierce austerities.”
'29': >-
  “Knowing, O tiger among men, that you were nearby, I will not go to Brahma’s
  world without seeing you, my dear guest.”
'30': >-
  “Having met you, O tiger among men—righteous and great-souled—I shall go to
  the highest heaven.”
'31': >-
  “O lion among men, auspicious worlds, imperishable, have been won by
  me—Brahma’s world and the world of the summit of heaven. Accept these of
  mine.”
'32': >-
  Thus addressed by the rishi Sharabhanga, that tiger among men, Raghava—skilled
  in all the shastras—spoke in reply:
'33': >-
  “I myself shall win all worlds, O great sage. I desire a dwelling-place
  assigned here in this forest.”
'34': >-
  When Raghava had spoken thus—he whose strength was equal to
  Shakra’s—Sharabhanga the supremely wise again said these words:
'35': >-
  “Here, Rama of great splendour, dwells Su-tikshna, a righteous one,
  disciplined, in this forest. He will bring about what is best for you.”
'36': >-
  “Go to Su-tikshna, that ascetic, in a pure region, in a delightful tract of
  woodland; he will arrange a dwelling for you.”
'37': >-
  “Follow this Mandakini, Rama, going against the current; that river which
  bears along blossoms like stars—then you will reach there.”
'38': >-
  “This is the path, O tiger among men. Look upon me for a moment, dear child,
  while I cast off my limbs, as a serpent (casts off) its worn-out skin.”
'39': >-
  Then, kindling the fire and offering oblations of ghee in due form with
  mantras, Sharabhanga of great splendour entered into the sacred fire.
'40': >-
  Then the fire consumed the hair and the nails of that great-souled one—his
  worn-out skin, his bones, and whatever flesh and blood there was.
'41': >-
  And he attained the form of a youthful man, resplendent like fire; rising from
  that heap of fire, Sharabhanga shone forth in radiance.
'42': >-
  Transcending the worlds of the great-souled rishis who maintain the sacred
  fires, and even surpassing the worlds of the gods, he ascended to Brahma’s
  world.
'43': >-
  That twice-born bull among sages, of meritorious deeds, in that realm beheld
  the Grandsire (Brahma) together with his attendants; and the Grandsire too,
  seeing that brahmana, rejoiced and said, “Welcome, welcome.”
'44': >-
  Thus ends the fifth canto in the Aranya-kanda of the holy Valmiki-Ramayana,
  the primeval epic, called “Sharabhanga’s Departure to the World of Brahma.”
