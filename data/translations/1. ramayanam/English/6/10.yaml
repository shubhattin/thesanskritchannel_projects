  Now begins the tenth chapter in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Vibhīṣaṇa’s Wholesome Counsel.”
'1': >-
  Then, when the dawn had come, Vibhīṣaṇa—of dreadful deeds, and firm in his
  resolve concerning righteousness and worldly welfare—set out toward the
  mansion of the lord of the Rākṣasas.
'2': >-
  It resembled a piled-up mass of mountain peaks, towering high like a mountain
  summit; it had great terraces and spacious divisions, and was thronged with
  multitudes of people.
'3': >-
  It was occupied by wise and devoted high ministers, and on every side it was
  guarded by competent and trusted Rākṣasas.
'4': >-
  The winds there were disturbed by the snorting breath of intoxicated
  elephants; it resounded with conch-calls and mighty clamour, and was filled
  with the blare of musical instruments.
'5': >-
  It was crowded with hosts of women; its great roads rang with loud chatter; it
  was lined with walls of heated, gleaming gold, and adorned with the finest
  ornaments.
'6': >-
  It seemed like a dwelling of Gandharvas, like the abode of the Maruts; it was
  packed with heaps of jewels, like the palace of the Nāgas in their enjoyments.
'7': >-
  That hero of great splendour entered the abode of his elder brother, which,
  like the sun with far-spreading rays, shone forth like a vast orb of radiance.
'8': >-
  The exceedingly radiant Vibhīṣaṇa heard auspicious benedictions and sacred
  acclamations proclaimed by Veda-knowing brahmins—uttered to secure his
  brother’s victory.
'9': >-
  And that mighty one beheld the brahmins, learned in mantras and the Vedas,
  honoured with bowls of curds, with ghee, and with fair flowers and unbroken
  grains.
'10': >-
  Being honoured by the Rākṣasas, he approached the mighty-armed younger brother
  of the Lord of Wealth (Kubera)—Rāvaṇa—who, seated on his throne, blazed with
  his own splendour; and Vibhīṣaṇa bowed to him.
'11': >-
  Expert in propriety, he went to a seat adorned with gold and befitting royal
  dignity, and took his place according to established decorum.
'12': >-
  Then, in a secluded place, in the presence of counsellors, he addressed
  Rāvaṇa—the great-souled one—with words exceedingly beneficial, and grounded in
  sound reasoning.
'13': >-
  Having first propitiated his elder brother and approached him with gentle
  conciliation—speaking in harmony with place, time, and purpose, and discerning
  the good and ill of this world—he spoke thus:
'14': >-
  “From the time Vaidehī came here, O scorcher of foes, from that very time we
  have been seeing in our midst inauspicious portents.
'15': >-
  “Though the sacred fire is kindled by mantras, it does not blaze forth
  properly; it throws sparks, its flame is smoky, and its rising is sullied with
  smoke and gloom.
'16': >-
  “In the fire-altars and in the fire-halls, and likewise at the Brahmā-shrines,
  serpents are seen—and ants are seen among the offerings.
'17': >-
  “The milk of the cows is spilt; excellent elephants are spiritless; horses
  whinny in distress, though they used to delight in fresh fodder.
'18': >-
  “Donkeys, camels, and mules, O king, have their hair standing apart and they
  dribble; and even when remedial rites are performed, they do not remain in
  their normal condition.
'19': >-
  “Cruel crows, gathered in flocks, cry out on every side; and in flocks they
  are seen assembled upon the tops of aerial chariots and lofty structures.
'20': >-
  “Vultures cluster and settle above the city in dense groups; and at both
  twilights the jackals cry out inauspiciously.
'21': >-
  “At the city gates there are heard, in great number, loud cries of
  flesh-eating beasts and other animals—sounds accompanied by rumbling and
  ominous reverberation.
'22': >-
  “Since this is the situation in the matter at hand, this act of atonement is
  fitting: I approve, O hero—let Vaidehī be given back to Rāghava.”
'23': >-
  “And even if these words have been spoken by me out of delusion or out of
  greed, even so, O great king, you ought not to take offence at it.
'24': >-
  “For this fault is perceived as marking everyone—Rākṣasas and Rākṣasīs, the
  city, and the inner palace alike.
'25': >-
  “Moreover, when this counsel had to be delivered, all the ministers held back.
  Yet it is necessary that I speak what I have seen or heard. Having duly
  reflected according to justice, your majesty ought to act accordingly.”
'26': >-
  Thus, in the midst of his own counsellors, did the brother Vibhīṣaṇa speak to
  his brother Rāvaṇa, the foremost of Rākṣasas—offering him this wholesome
  advice.
'27': >-
  Hearing those words—beneficial, weighty in import, gentle, supported by
  reasons, appropriate to past, future, and present—Rāvaṇa, seized by an inner
  fever, replied with this connected rejoinder:
'28': >-
  “I do not see fear from any quarter whatsoever. Rāghava shall never obtain
  Maithilī. How indeed, even with the gods and Indra together in battle, will
  the elder brother of Lakṣmaṇa be able to stand before me?”
'29': >-
  Having spoken thus, the mighty Daśānana—fierce in valour in battle, the
  destroyer of armies of the gods—then dismissed his brother Vibhīṣaṇa, who had
  spoken truthful counsel.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the tenth chapter in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “Vibhīṣaṇa’s Wholesome Counsel.”
