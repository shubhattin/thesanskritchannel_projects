  Now begins the seventy-second sarga in the Bālakāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Auspicious Rite of the Gift of Cows.”
'1': >-
  When that Vaideha (Janaka), the valiant king, had spoken thus, the great sage
  Viśvāmitra, together with Vasiṣṭha, addressed the heroic ruler with these
  words.
'2': >-
  O bull among men, the lineages of the Ikṣvākus and of the Videhas are
  inconceivable in their greatness and immeasurable; none among men is their
  equal.
'3': >-
  O king, the bond of dharma between them is alike, and alike too is the
  excellence of their beauty: Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, and Sītā together with Ūrmilā,
  are perfectly matched.
'4': >-
  And further, O best of men, hear my statement, for it ought to be declared:
  there is this king Kuśadhvaja—your younger brother—who is a knower of dharma.
'5': >-
  O king, we seek to choose, as wives for him, his two daughters—those two
  maidens, unequalled in beauty upon the earth, born of that righteous-souled
  monarch.
'6': >-
  For Bharata, the prince, and for the wise Śatrughna, I request your daughters,
  O king, as brides for those two great-souled ones.
'7': >-
  These sons of Daśaratha are endowed with beauty and youthful vigour; all are
  like the Lokapālas, and possess prowess equal to the gods.
'8': >-
  Therefore, O lord of kings, let both royal houses be bound together by
  kinship; and let the blameless Ikṣvāku lineage of you, the performer of
  meritorious deeds, be thus allied.
'9': >-
  Having heard the words of Viśvāmitra, and being then in accord with Vasiṣṭha’s
  counsel, Janaka, with palms joined, spoke to the two foremost of sages.
'10': >-
  I deem this lineage blessed indeed, in that those two chief among sages
  themselves command a fitting alliance of families.
'11': >-
  So be it; welfare be to you. Let these daughters of Kuśadhvaja, together,
  become the wives of Śatrughna and Bharata.
'12': >-
  Within a single day, O great sage, let the four mighty princes take the hands
  of the four royal maidens in marriage.
'13': >-
  On the following day, O Brahman, the wise commend the marriage rite under the
  asterisms of the Phalgunīs, wherein Bhaga, the Lord of creatures (Prajāpati),
  presides.
'14': >-
  Having thus spoken these gentle words, King Janaka rose, and with hands folded
  addressed those two best of sages once more.
'15': >-
  A supreme duty has been accomplished for me; and I am a disciple of you both.
  Let these eminent seats be made ready—be seated, O foremost of sages.
'16': >-
  As Ayodhyā is for Daśaratha, so is the city for me; there is no doubt as to my
  authority—do as is fitting, according to due propriety.
'17': >-
  When the Vaideha, Janaka, spoke thus, King Daśaratha, gladdened, replied to
  that lord of the earth in the presence of the delight of the Raghus.
'18': >-
  You two brothers, lords of Mithilā, are possessed of innumerable virtues;
  sages and gatherings of kings alike are duly honoured by you both.
'19': >-
  May auspiciousness attend you; well be to you. We shall depart to our own
  abode, and I shall perform the śrāddha rites in accordance with the prescribed
  ordinances—so he said.
'20': >-
  Having taken leave of the lord of men, King Daśaratha then, placing those two
  sage-lords in the forefront, departed swiftly, that highly renowned monarch.
'21': >-
  Having reached his residence, the king performed the śrāddha according to
  rule; and at dawn, rising early, he carried out the excellent rite of gifting
  cows.
'22': >-
  The lord of men gave to the Brāhmaṇas a hundred thousand cows, the king
  bestowing them one by one, in righteousness, dedicating the gift to his sons.
'23': >-
  Four hundred thousand cows—each furnished with golden horns, well-provided and
  accompanied by calves, with milking-vessels of bronze—did that bull among men
  bestow.
'24': >-
  And much other wealth besides did the delight of the Raghus—affectionate
  toward his sons—give to the twice-born, intending the cow-gift as an
  auspicious act for his sons.
'25': >-
  Then that lord of kings, surrounded by his sons after the cow-gifts had been
  made, shone forth like the gentle Prajāpati surrounded by the Lokapālas.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-second sarga in the Bālakāṇḍa of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the revered Ādikāvya, entitled “The Auspicious Rite of the Gift of Cows.”
