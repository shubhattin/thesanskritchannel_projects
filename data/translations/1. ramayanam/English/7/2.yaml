  Now begins, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the Second
  Sarga, entitled “The Birth of Paulastya (Viśravas),” (7.2).
'1': >-
  Having heard that speech of the great-souled Rāghava (Rāma), the mighty and
  effulgent sage, born of the pot (Kumbhayoni—Agastya), then spoke these words
  to Rāma.
'2': >-
  “Listen, O Rāma, to the account in full—how great indeed were his splendour
  and strength: by which he slew his enemies, and by which he was not to be
  slain by those very foes.”
'3': >-
  “Then, O Rāghava, I shall tell you of this lineage of Rāvaṇa—his family and
  his birth—and also of the granting of the boon, and how that boon was bestowed
  upon him.”
'4': >-
  “Formerly, in the Kṛta age, O Rāma, there was a lordly Brahmarṣi named
  Pulastya, a son of Prajāpati—like the Grandsire (Brahmā) himself in manifest
  form.”
'5': >-
  “It is not possible to recount his virtues in full—his righteousness and his
  conduct and disposition—for he could be spoken of, by name alone, as ‘the son
  of Prajāpati,’ (and that itself suffices).”
'6': >-
  “By virtue of being Prajāpati’s son he was indeed beloved of the gods; that
  great-minded one, by his pure and auspicious qualities, delighted the entire
  world.”
'7': >-
  “Now, on an occasion connected with dharma, that best of sages went to the
  hermitage of Tṛṇavindu, on the flank of the great mountain Meru, and took up
  his abode there.”
'8': >-
  “That righteous-souled one practised austerities, with senses restrained and
  devoted to sacred study. And in that hermitage-ground, maidens came and caused
  obstacles to him.”
'9': >-
  “Daughters of the gods and of the serpents, and daughters of royal seers, and
  also apsarases engaged in sport—all of them resorted to that region.”
'10': >-
  “Because the grove was enjoyable in every season and because of its charm and
  loveliness, the maidens would, as a constant practice, go to that place and
  sport there.”
'11': >-
  “And because that land was so delightful, the blameless maidens—singing,
  playing instruments, and dancing—created an obstruction to the austerities of
  that ascetic sage Pulastya who dwelt there.”
'12': >-
  “Then the great and mighty Mahāmuni, angered, spoke thus: ‘She who comes
  within my sight shall conceive and bear a child.’”
'13': >-
  “All of them, having heard and accepted the words of that great-souled one,
  and fearing the Brahmarṣi’s curse, no longer approached that place.”
'14': >-
  “But the daughter of the royal seer Tṛṇabindu did not hear of this
  (prohibition/curse).”},{
