  Now begins the seventy-seventh canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Lamentation of Bharata and Śatrughna.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, when ten days had passed, the prince, having performed the rites
  of purification, caused the śrāddha rites to be duly carried out on the
  twelfth day.
'2': >-
  To the brāhmaṇas he gave jewels, wealth, and abundant food; and also garments
  of great value, as well as various kinds of precious gems.
'3': >-
  And many white robes of fine cloth; and cows also by the hundreds; and
  maidservants and servants, and conveyances, and very great mansions as well.
'4': >-
  Thus did the king’s son present to the brāhmaṇas all the offerings pertaining
  to his father’s funeral obsequies. Then, at daybreak, on the thirteenth day,
'5': >-
  mighty-armed Bharata, overwhelmed by sorrow, burst into lamentation—his throat
  choked so that his voice was muffled—having come there for the purpose of
  purification.
'6': >-
  At the foot of his father’s funeral pyre, exceedingly distressed, he spoke
  these words: “Father, to the brother Rāghava, you entrusted me—
'7': >-
  yet when that one departed to the forest, you abandoned me here, left desolate
  by you—like the helpless course of one without protector, when the son is sent
  away to the woods.
'8': >-
  Having left that mother—Kauśalyā—where have you gone, O king? Beholding this
  reddened ash, this circular space where the bones have been burnt,
'9': >-
  Bharata, wailing over the extinction of his father’s body, sank down in
  despair. And seeing it, he wept piteously and fell upon the earth.
'10': >-
  As he was being raised up—like the banner of Indra fallen from its
  mechanism—then all his ministers rushed towards him, that pure-vowed one.
'11': >-
  And Śatrughna too, seeing Bharata flooded with grief, remembering the lord of
  the earth, fell senseless upon the ground—like the sages speak of Yayāti
  fallen at the end of his time.
'12': >-
  Bereft of consciousness he sank to the earth, thinking of the protector of the
  land; then, as though distraught and void of sense, he lamented in grievous
  sorrow.
'13': >-
  Recalling again and again those many noble qualities and features of his
  father, Bharata was plunged into a fierce distress—born of Mantharā, thronged
  with the “crocodile” of Kaikeyī—
'14': >-
  and that unfathomable ocean of grief, made of the granting of boons, caused
  him to sink. “You who always cherished me—delicate, a mere child—
'15': >-
  where have you gone, O father, leaving Bharata here, lamenting? Indeed, in
  foods and drinks, in garments and ornaments,
'16': >-
  you used to provide for us all—who will do that for us today? At the time of
  such rending sorrow, why does not the earth split asunder?
'17': >-
  Deprived of you, O king—knower of dharma and great-souled—when father has
  attained heaven and Rāma has taken refuge in the forest,
'18': >-
  what strength have I to go on living? I shall enter the blazing fire. Bereft
  of both brother and father, how shall I enter Ayodhyā, guarded by the Ikṣvāku
  line, now empty?
'19': >-
  I shall not enter Ayodhyā; I shall enter a forest of austerities.” Hearing the
  lament of those two and beholding that calamity,
'20': >-
  all their followers were again and again overwhelmed, becoming exceedingly
  more afflicted.
'21': >-
  Then both Śatrughna and Bharata—dejected and exhausted—writhed upon the ground
  like two bulls with broken horns.
'22': >-
  Then Vasiṣṭha, their father’s purohita—steadfast in his nature and skilled in
  healing—having raised Bharata up, spoke these words to him:
'23': >-
  “This is the thirteenth day since your father’s passing, O mighty one. Why do
  you linger here, where only a remnant heap of bones remains?
'24': >-
  In beings, three pairs of opposites proceed without distinction; and since
  those are unavoidable, it is not fitting that it should be thus.” And Sumantṛa
  too, having raised Śatrughna and soothed him,
'25': >-
  that knower of truth caused them to hear of the true nature of the
  coming-to-be and passing-away of all beings. Then those two tiger-like men
  rose, illustrious and renowned,
'26': >-
  like two Indra-banners standing apart, drenched by rain and scorched by
  sun—wiping away their tears, their eyes reddened, speaking in a faint and
  miserable voice.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-seventh canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Primeval Epic, entitled “The Lamentation of Bharata and
  Śatrughna.”
