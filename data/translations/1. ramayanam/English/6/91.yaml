  Now begins the ninety-first canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Slaying of Rāvaṇi (Indrajit).”
'1': >-
  Indrajit, the night-ranger of great splendour, his horses slain, stood upon
  the ground, supremely enraged; and in his wrath he blazed forth with his own
  energy.
'2': >-
  Those two bowmen, seeking to slay each other, assailed one another fiercely
  with arrows, advancing for victory like an elephant and a bull in a forest.
'3': >-
  And as those rākṣasas and forest-dwellers (the monkeys) pressed upon one
  another and struck each other down, they did not abandon their leaders in
  battle, but fell upon the fight again and again from this side and that.
'4': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa’s son, gladdening all those rākṣasas, praising them and himself
  rejoicing, spoke these words:
'5': >-
  “By thick darkness all these quarters are enveloped on every side; here it is
  not discerned who is one’s own and who is the other, O foremost of rākṣasas.
'6': >-
  “Fight boldly, that the monkeys may be deluded. As for me, mounting my
  chariot, I shall come again to the battle.”
'7': >-
  “Do you act in such a way that these forest-dwellers, those great-souled ones,
  do not keep fighting when I have entered the city.”
'8': >-
  Having spoken thus, Rāvaṇa’s son, deceiving the forest-dwellers, entered the
  city of Laṅkā to obtain a chariot—he, the slayer of foes.
'9': >-
  Then, having adorned a chariot—beautiful and decked with gold—furnished with
  spears, swords, and arrows, and yoked with excellent steeds—
'10': >-
  —attended by a charioteer versed in the science of horses and one who followed
  trusted instruction—Rāvaṇi of great radiance, conqueror in battle, mounted it.
'11': >-
  That hero, the son of Mandodarī, surrounded by the foremost rākṣasas, went out
  from the city, impelled as though by the power of Death (Kṛtānta).
'12': >-
  Having come forth from the city, Indrajit of supreme might rushed with swift
  horses toward Lakṣmaṇa, who was with Vibhīṣaṇa.
'13': >-
  Seeing Rāvaṇa’s son stationed in his chariot, Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), and the
  mighty monkey-heroes, and Vibhīṣaṇa the rākṣasa, beheld him.
'14': >-
  They were seized with great wonder at the skill and swiftness of that
  intelligent one; while Rāvaṇi too, enraged in battle, (turned upon) the monkey
  commanders.
'15': >-
  Wielding his bow in circles, Rāvaṇi, conqueror in battle, brought them down
  with showers of arrows—by hundreds, and then by thousands.
'16': >-
  Wrathful, taking refuge in supreme quickness, he struck the monkeys. Being
  slain by barbed shafts, those monkeys of dreadful prowess—
'17': >-
  —took refuge in Saumitri, as subjects take refuge in Prajāpati. Then the son
  of Raghu, inflamed with battle-wrath, cut off his bow, displaying the
  swiftness of his hand.
'18': >-
  Thereupon Indrajit, seizing another bow, swiftly strung it; but that too
  Lakṣmaṇa cut to pieces with three arrows.
'19': >-
  Then Saumitri pierced Rāvaṇi—now with his bow severed—upon the chest with five
  arrows, like the venom of a serpent.
'20': >-
  Those arrows, shot forth from the great bow, cleft his body and fell to the
  earth, blood-smeared like great serpents.
'21': >-
  And Rāvaṇi, his bow cut, vomiting blood from his mouth, grasped a foremost
  bow, firm-stringed and even mightier.
'22': >-
  Aiming at Lakṣmaṇa, adopting supreme swiftness, he rained showers of arrows
  like Purandara (Indra) rains down showers of rain.
'23': >-
  That arrow-rain, released by Indrajit the subduer of foes, hard to withstand,
  Lakṣmaṇa warded off unshaken.
'24': >-
  Then the son of Raghu showed himself unperturbed before Rāvaṇi; that
  great-radiant one appeared as something marvellous.
'25': >-
  Then, supremely enraged, he pierced all those rākṣasas in the battle—each with
  three arrows—displaying his swift weapon-skill; and he also smote the son of
  the rākṣasa-king (Indrajit) with a flood of arrows.
'26': >-
  Though grievously pierced by that mighty foe, the slayer of enemies, Indrajit
  sent forth many arrows at Lakṣmaṇa without pause.
'27': >-
  Those, before they could reach, the slayer of hostile heroes cut down with
  sharp arrows; and in the battle Lakṣmaṇa, best of chariot-warriors, also—
'28': >-
  —took off the head of his charioteer with a broad-headed arrow of unbent
  joints. Then those horses, their driver slain, drew the chariot there without
  faltering.
'29': >-
  They ran in circles—marvellous indeed to behold. Saumitri, of firm valour,
  fell under the sway of righteous indignation.
'30': >-
  He pierced those horses with arrows, terrifying them in battle. Indrajit,
  Rāvaṇa’s son, unable to endure that deed in the fight—
'31': >-
  —pierced that unenduring (dauntless) Saumitri with ten arrows. Those arrows,
  like thunderbolts, like serpent-venom, came and were spent, meeting his
  golden-hued armour.
'32': >-
  Thinking Lakṣmaṇa’s armour to be impenetrable, Indrajit, Rāvaṇa’s son, struck
  Lakṣmaṇa on the forehead with three well-feathered arrows—
'33': >-
  —supremely enraged, displaying swift weapon-skill. With those shafts fixed in
  his brow, the son of Raghu shone forth—
'34': >-
  —like a triple-peaked mountain at the front of battle, glorying in combat. Yet
  though thus afflicted by the rākṣasa’s arrows in that fight,
'35': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa quickly pierced Indrajit in return with five arrows, drawing his bow;
  and Indrajit was struck in the face, adorned with bright earrings.
'36': >-
  Those two heroes, Lakṣmaṇa and Indrajit, of great might and bearing mighty
  bows, smote one another—those dreadful warriors—with terrible arrows.
'37': >-
  Then both Lakṣmaṇa and Indrajit, their limbs smeared with blood, shone upon
  the battlefield like blossoming kiṃśuka trees.
'38': >-
  Approaching one another, those two bowmen pierced each other in every limb
  with dreadful arrows, both resolved upon victory.
'39': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa’s son, joined with battle-wrath, pierced Vibhīṣaṇa in his fair
  face with three arrows.
'40': >-
  Having struck the rākṣasa-king Vibhīṣaṇa with three iron-pointed shafts, he
  pierced each of all those monkey commanders, one by one, with single arrows.
'41': >-
  Then mighty Vibhīṣaṇa, enraged, struck down the horses of that wicked Rāvaṇi
  with a heavier blow—smashing them with his mace.
'42': >-
  His horses slain, and leaping down from his chariot whose charioteer had been
  killed, that great-radiant one then hurled a spear at his paternal uncle.
'43': >-
  Seeing it rushing down, the increaser of Sumitrā’s joy (Lakṣmaṇa) cut it with
  keen arrows into ten parts and cast it to the ground.
'44': >-
  Then Vibhīṣaṇa, his bow firm, enraged at the horse-slaying, launched five
  arrows, equal to the touch of a thunderbolt, into his chest.
'45': >-
  Those arrows, their golden feathers true to their aim, pierced his body; they
  became smeared with blood, like great serpents reddened.
'46': >-
  Indrajit, angered at his paternal uncle, took up an arrow—supreme among the
  rākṣasas—given by Yama, of great power.
'47': >-
  Beholding that great shaft fitted to his weapon, Lakṣmaṇa too, of dreadful
  prowess, took up another arrow.
'48': >-
  That arrow had been given in a dream by Kubera himself, the immeasurable
  one—unconquerable and hard to withstand even by the gods and asuras along with
  Indra.
'49': >-
  Then their excellent bows, drawn mightily by arms like iron bars, resounded
  like two krauñcha birds.
'50': >-
  Upon those two excellent bows, the two foremost arrows, thus set and drawn by
  the heroes, blazed exceedingly with splendour.
'51': >-
  Illuminating the sky, those two arrows, loosed from their bows, struck face to
  face and met with force.
'52': >-
  Terrible was the collision of those two fearsome arrows; with smoke and
  sparks, that fiery blaze became dreadful indeed.
'53': >-
  Like great meteors, they struck one another in combat, shattered into a
  hundred pieces, and fell upon the earth.
'54': >-
  Seeing their arrows struck down on the crest of battle, both Lakṣmaṇa and
  Indrajit, then, felt shame—and anger arose in them.
'55': >-
  Saumitri, greatly incensed, took up the Varuṇa weapon; and Indrajit, standing
  firm in the fight, released the Rudra weapon in battle.
'56': >-
  By that, the wondrous Varuṇa weapon that had been employed was (countered);
  then Indrajit, mighty and battle-conquering, angered, fitted the blazing Agni
  weapon, as though he would compress the world.
'57': >-
  That weapon the hero Lakṣmaṇa warded off with the Sun weapon. Seeing his
  weapon checked, Rāvaṇi, overcome by wrath,
'58': >-
  took up a keen Asura arrow, a destroyer of foes; and from his bow there sprang
  forth radiant maces with iron knobs.
'59': >-
  There appeared also tridents and bhusuṇḍīs (heavy dart-like missiles), clubs,
  swords, and axes. Seeing that dreadful Asura weapon in the battle, Lakṣmaṇa—
'60': >-
  —irresistible to all beings, shattering all weapons—warded it off with the
  resplendent Maheśvara weapon.
'61': >-
  Between those two there arose a marvellous, hair-raising battle; the beings
  stationed in the heavens encompassed Lakṣmaṇa.
'62': >-
  In that fearful war of monkeys and rākṣasas, filled with dreadful cries, the
  sky came to be covered by many astonished beings.
'63': >-
  Ṛṣis, Pitṛs, Devas, Gandharvas, Garuḍas, and Nāgas—placing Śatakratu (Indra)
  in the forefront—protected Lakṣmaṇa in battle.
'64': >-
  Then the younger brother of Rāghava fitted another foremost arrow—equal in
  touch to blazing fire, meant to rend Rāvaṇa’s son.
'65': >-
  With fine wings, following the line of its shaft, with excellent joints,
  well-made, wrought with gold—the hero (took up) that arrow, the ender of
  bodies.
'66': >-
  Hard to ward off, hard to endure, fearsome to the rākṣasas, like
  serpent-venom, honoured by hosts of gods—
'67': >-
  —with which mighty Śakra, lord and great-radiant, formerly conquered the
  dānavas in the war of gods and asuras—he, valiant, borne by Hari (Airāvata).
'68': >-
  Then Saumitri, in battle, drew upon his excellent bow that Indra-weapon,
  unconquered in combats, and spoke these words while drawing the foremost
  arrow:
'69': >-
  “If Rāma Dāśarathi—righteous-souled, true to his vow, a fulfiller of aims—be
  indeed endowed with fortune, and without rival in manly prowess, then slay
  this Rāvaṇi!”
'70': >-
  Having spoken thus, Lakṣmaṇa the hero drew the straight-going arrow to his ear
  and hurled it at Indrajit in the battle, yoking it with the
  Indra-weapon—Lakṣmaṇa, slayer of hostile heroes.
'71': >-
  That head, with its helmet, radiant with glorious blazing
  earrings—Indrajit’s—Lakṣmaṇa struck down from his body, and it fell upon the
  earth.
'72': >-
  That great head of the rākṣasa prince, its neck severed, like heated gold, was
  seen on the ground, drenched in blood.
'73': >-
  Slain, Rāvaṇa’s son then fell upon the earth, armoured, with helmet on, his
  bow shattered and pierced through with arrows.
'74': >-
  Then all the monkeys, with Vibhīṣaṇa, cried aloud; they rejoiced when he was
  slain, like the gods at the killing of Vṛtra.
'75': >-
  Then in mid-air there arose a shout of victory among the gods and the
  great-souled ṛṣis, and also among the gandharvas and apsarases.
'76': >-
  Knowing that he had fallen, that vast rākṣasa host, being slain by the monkeys
  of conquered radiance, fled to the quarters.
'77': >-
  Smitten by the monkeys, those rākṣasas, casting away their weapons, ran toward
  Laṅkā, bereft of sense, driven in panic.
'78': >-
  Terrified in many ways, rākṣasas by the hundreds fled in all directions,
  abandoning all weapons—clubs, swords, and axes.
'79': >-
  Some, frightened, entered Laṅkā, harried by the monkeys; some fell into the
  sea; and some took refuge on the mountains.
'80': >-
  Seeing Indrajit slain and lying on the battlefield, among thousands of
  rākṣasas not a single one was seen to stand and face (the fight).
'81': >-
  As, when the sun has set, the rays do not remain, so when he had fallen, those
  rākṣasas departed to all quarters.
'82': >-
  Like the sun whose rays have grown still, like a fire gone out, that
  mighty-armed one lay with life departed.
'83': >-
  With anguish stilled, foes destroyed, the world became filled with joy when
  the rākṣasa-king’s son had fallen.
'84': >-
  The blessed Śakra too, along with all the great ṛṣis, attained gladness when
  that sinful rākṣasa was slain.
'85': >-
  And in the sky of the gods was heard the sound of kettledrums, along with
  dancing apsarases and great-souled gandharvas.
'86': >-
  They rained down showers of flowers—it was as though marvellous to behold—when
  that cruel-doing rākṣasa was slain and the tumult subsided.
'87': >-
  The waters became clear and the sky as well; devas and dānavas rejoiced when
  that terror to all worlds had fallen.
'88': >-
  Pleased and gathered together, the gods, gandharvas, and dānavas said: “Let
  brāhmaṇas now roam free from fever, their defilement stilled.”
'89': >-
  Then the monkey commanders, delighted on the battlefield, exulted when they
  saw that foremost of rākṣasas, of unequalled might, slain.
'90': >-
  Vibhīṣaṇa, Hanūmān, and Jāmbavān, commander of the bears, rejoicing in the
  victory, praised Lakṣmaṇa also.
'91': >-
  Roaring, leaping, and making cries of triumph, the monkeys, their aim
  achieved, surrounded the son of Raghu and waited upon him.
'92': >-
  Waving their tails and snapping them, the monkeys then made this proclamation
  resound: “Lakṣmaṇa is victorious!”
'93': >-
  And embracing one another, the monkeys, their hearts delighted, spoke many
  kinds of excellent tales, taking refuge in (and celebrating) Rāghava.
'94': >-
  Beholding that deed of Lakṣmaṇa in battle—so difficult to accomplish—his dear
  friends rejoiced; and the gods, hearing that Indra’s enemy had been slain,
  attained the highest exultation of mind.
'95': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-first canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, called “The Slaying of Rāvaṇi (Indrajit).”
