  Now, in the blessed Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-second chapter, called “Vasiṣṭha’s Hospitality.”
'1': >-
  Seeing him, the mighty Viśvāmitra—of great prowess—became exceedingly
  delighted; and that heroic one, bowing in humility, made obeisance to
  Vasiṣṭha, the foremost among those who practise sacred recitation.
'2': >-
  The great-souled Vasiṣṭha said to him, “Welcome.” And the venerable Lord
  Vasiṣṭha bade that a seat be given to him.
'3': >-
  And when the wise Viśvāmitra had sat down, the best of sages, in accordance
  with due custom, brought forward fruits and roots.
'4': >-
  Having accepted that honor from Vasiṣṭha, the foremost of kings inquired after
  the welfare of his ascetic observances, his sacrificial fires, and his
  disciples.
'5': >-
  Then the glorious Viśvāmitra spoke of welfare in regard to the multitude of
  forest-trees; and Vasiṣṭha, O best of kings, declared that all was well on
  every side.
'6': >-
  When king Viśvāmitra, the great ascetic, was seated at ease, Vasiṣṭha—son of
  Brahmā, and the foremost among those who recite prayers—questioned him.
'7': >-
  “Is it well with you, O king? And, delighting your subjects by righteousness,
  do you protect the people, O king—O righteous one—according to the proper
  duties of kings?
'8': >-
  “Are your servants well provided for? Do they remain within your command and
  discipline? Have you conquered all your enemies, O slayer of foes?
'9': >-
  “Is there prosperity for you in your forces, in your treasury, and among your
  allies, O scorcher of foes? O tiger among men, O sinless one—are your sons and
  grandsons also in welfare?
'10': >-
  To Vasiṣṭha the king replied that everywhere all was well—Viśvāmitra of great
  splendor, addressing Vasiṣṭha with due humility.
'11': >-
  And having conversed for a long time then—those two righteous ones—upon
  matters of dharma, they, filled with supreme joy, were mutually pleased with
  each other.
'12': >-
  Then, at the close of the conversation, venerable Vasiṣṭha—O delight of the
  Raghus—spoke this word to Viśvāmitra, as though smiling.
'13': >-
  “I desire to render hospitality, O mighty one, to this host of yours, and to
  you also—whose measure is beyond reckoning. Accept from me, now, what is
  fitting to your worth.”
'14': >-
  “Indeed, accept this courteous service performed by me. O king, you are a most
  excellent guest, worthy to be honored with all effort.”
'15': >-
  Thus addressed by Vasiṣṭha, the great-minded Viśvāmitra replied, “It is done,
  O king—by these words of honor with which you have received me.”
'16': >-
  “With fruits and roots, O Blessed One, as are found in your hermitage; with
  water for washing the feet, and water for sipping; and with the very sight of
  you, venerable sir—”
'17': >-
  “In every way, O exceedingly wise one, I—worthy of worship—have been well
  worshiped. Salutations be to you; I shall depart. Look upon me with a friendly
  eye.”
'18': >-
  As the king spoke thus, the righteous Vasiṣṭha—of noble understanding—invited
  him yet again, repeatedly.
'19': >-
  Gādhi’s son (Viśvāmitra) replied to Vasiṣṭha, “So be it indeed. As is pleasing
  to the Blessed One, so let it be, O bull among sages.”
'20': >-
  Thus addressed by him, Vasiṣṭha—foremost among those who recite prayers—then,
  being pleased, summoned Śabalā, the spotted cow, she who had her impurities
  cleansed away.
'21': >-
  “Come, come quickly, O Śabalā, and hear my words as well. I have resolved to
  provide this royal sage and his army with hospitality by a most excellent
  meal. Arrange for me this honored reception.”
'22': >-
  “Whatever any one of them desires, and with whatever is to their liking—duly
  honored with the six flavors—O divine wish-fulfilling one, shower all of that
  forth, for my undertaking.”
'23': >-
  “With savory juices, with food, with drink, together with things to be licked
  and things to be sucked—create at once, O Śabalā, a complete store and
  abundance of provisions.”
'24': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-second chapter in the Bālakāṇḍa of the blessed Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, called “Vasiṣṭha’s Hospitality.”
