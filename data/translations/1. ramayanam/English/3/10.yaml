  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the tenth canto called
  “The Vindication of the Slaying of the Rākṣasas.”
'1': >-
  Hearing these words spoken by Vaidehī with devotion to her husband,
  Rāma—steadfast in righteousness—then replied to Jānakī.
'2': >-
  “O Devi, what you have spoken is wholesome and fitting—uttered with affection;
  and it is worthy of you who speak with regard to your noble lineage, O
  daughter of Janaka, who are a knower of dharma.
'3': >-
  “What indeed shall I say, O Devi? This very word has already been spoken by
  you: that the bow is borne by kṣatriyas so that there may be no cry of
  distress (unanswered).
'4': >-
  “And those afflicted sages in the Daṇḍaka forest—of well-honed vows—came to me
  themselves, O Sītā, and sought refuge in me, the refuge-worthy, as their
  refuge.
'5': >-
  “Dwelling in the woods at all seasons and times, subsisting on roots and
  fruits, they find no ease, O timid one, because of the rākṣasas of cruel
  deeds.
'6': >-
  “They are being devoured by dreadful rākṣasas who live on human flesh—those
  sages who dwell in the Daṇḍaka forest are being eaten.
'7': >-
  “‘Save us!’—so spoke to me the best among the twice-born; and when I heard
  this utterance that fell from their mouths in this manner,
'8': >-
  “having rendered obedience to their words, I spoke this speech: ‘May you all
  be pleased with me; this is my incomparable shame (that you should have had to
  come to me thus).’
'9': >-
  “And in the presence of the twice-born I also said: ‘If I have been approached
  and waited upon by such brāhmaṇa-sages, what can I do?’
'10': >-
  “Then, having all assembled together, this speech was spoken (to me): ‘In the
  Daṇḍaka forest there are many rākṣasas who assume forms at will;
'11': >-
  “we are exceedingly tormented, O Rāma—do you protect us there; and when the
  time of oblation has arrived, and at sacred festive seasons as well, O sinless
  one,
'12': >-
  “the rākṣasas—eaters of flesh, most difficult to assail—outrage and violate
  (our rites). And for those ascetics and tapasvins who are thus violated by the
  rākṣasas,
'13': >-
  “while seeking a way (of deliverance), you are our highest refuge. Indeed, by
  the power of their austerities they are capable of slaying the night-roamers,
  if they so desire;
'14': >-
  “but we do not wish to shatter the austerity we have long accumulated.
  Austerity, ever beset with many obstacles, is difficult to practise, O
  Rāghava.
'15': >-
  “Therefore, even while being devoured by the rākṣasas, we do not let loose a
  curse. So we—dwellers of the Daṇḍaka forest—being oppressed by the rākṣasas,
'16': >-
  “protect us, you, together with your brother; for in this forest we are under
  your guardianship.’ And having heard this speech, I undertook their protection
  in its entirety,
'17': >-
  “having pledged, O daughter of Janaka, to safeguard the ṛṣis in the Daṇḍaka
  forest. And having pledged, I shall not—so long as I live—be able to violate
  that promise.
'18': >-
  “To act otherwise toward the sages is not possible for me; truth is ever dear
  and chosen by me. I could even abandon my life—or even you, O Sītā, together
  with Lakṣmaṇa—
'19': >-
  “but having given a vow—especially to brāhmaṇas—I must not (forsake it).
  Therefore, safeguarding the sages must necessarily be done by me.
'20': >-
  “Moreover, O Vaidehī, even without being asked, how could I, after having
  vowed, do otherwise? Out of love and friendship for me, you have spoken this
  word.
'21': >-
  “I am pleased with you, O Sītā; for one who is not dear is not instructed
  thus. And your counsel is proper and consonant with your lineage, O beautiful
  one. You are my companion in dharma; you are dearer to me even than my
  life-breaths.”
'22': >-
  Having spoken thus, the great-souled Rāma, bearer of the bow, along with
  Lakṣmaṇa, went to the delightful groves of ascetics, together with his beloved
  Sītā, the princess—daughter of the king of Mithilā.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the tenth canto, named “The Vindication of the Slaying of the
  Rākṣasas,” in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval
  epic, composed in the ṛṣis’ tradition.
