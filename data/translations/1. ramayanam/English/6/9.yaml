  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the ninth
  chapter, entitled “The Counsel of Vibhīṣaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon came Nikumbha, and Rabhasa, and Sūryaśatru of great might; and
  Suptaghna, and Yajñakopa; and Mahāpārśva and Mahodara as well.
'2': >-
  And Agniketu, the unconquerable; and the rākṣasa Raśmiketu; and Indrajit also,
  of exceeding splendour—mighty, and the son of Rāvaṇa.
'3': >-
  Then Prahasta; and Virūpākṣa; and Vajradaṃṣṭra of great strength; and
  Dhūmrākṣa; and Atikāya; and the rākṣasa Durmukha as well.
'4': >-
  Seizing clubs and spears, tridents, lances, and javelins, battle-axes and
  hatchets; and bows with excellent arrows; and swords broad as the expanse of
  waters,
'5': >-
  those rākṣasas, exceedingly enraged, sprang up with their weapons in hand, and
  all addressed Rāvaṇa, blazing, as it were, with fiery energy.
'6': >-
  “Today we shall slay Rāma, and Sugrīva together with Lakṣmaṇa; and that
  wretched Hanumān also, by whom Laṅkā has been violated and assaulted.”
'7': >-
  Vibhīṣaṇa restrained them all, though they stood grasping their weapons; and,
  having made them sit down again, he spoke these words with joined palms.
'8': >-
  “Even by three means (of policy), dear ones, if an end cannot be attained,
  then those times suited for valour and prowess are declared by the wise to be
  the proper course.”
'9': >-
  “When foes are heedless, or when they are hard-pressed, or when they are
  smitten by fate itself—then, dear ones, acts of valour, undertaken after
  examination and performed according to right method, succeed.”
'10': >-
  “But how do you wish to assail him who is vigilant, eager for victory, firmly
  established in strength—one who has mastered his wrath, is difficult to
  overcome, and is not to be harassed?”
'11': >-
  “Having leapt across the dreadful ocean—the lord of rivers and streams—who in
  the world could truly know or even conjecture the range and power of Hanumān?”
'12': >-
  “The strengths and the valours of enemies, O night-rangers, are immeasurable;
  therefore contemptuous disregard of others through rashness must never be done
  in any way.”
'13': >-
  “And further, what injury did Rāma formerly do to the king of rākṣasas, whose
  renowned consort he brought away from Janasthāna?”
'14': >-
  “Khara, if it be recalled, was slain by Rāma in battle. The lives of living
  beings must certainly be protected to the best of one’s power.”
'15': >-
  “For this reason, Vaidehī would become a very great cause of fear to us. She,
  having been brought here, ought to be relinquished—what was achieved by making
  her the cause of quarrel?”
'16': >-
  “It is not fitting for that mighty one, who follows dharma, to create enmity
  without purpose. Let Maithilī be given back to him.”
'17': >-
  “Before, with his arrows, he rends this city—filled with many treasures, and
  furnished with elephants and horses—let Maithilī be given back to him.”
'18': >-
  “Before that exceedingly dreadful and vast army of monkeys, hard to withstand,
  descends upon Laṅkā, let Sītā be given back.”
'19': >-
  “Indeed Laṅkā-city would perish, and all the heroic rākṣasas too, if Rāma’s
  beloved wife is not of her own accord restored.”
'20': >-
  “I entreat you, by reason of our kinship: do my word. I speak what is
  wholesome and true—let Maithilī be given back to him.”
'21': >-
  “Formerly the prince, the son of a king, let fly unerring arrows against you
  for your destruction—arrows like the rays of the autumn sun, with newly
  fashioned fore-feathers and exceedingly firm. Let Maithilī be given back to
  Dāśarathi.”
'22': >-
  “Cast off swiftly this wrath that destroys happiness and dharma; resort to
  dharma, which increases delight and fame. Be gracious, so that we may live,
  together with sons and kinsmen. Let Maithilī be given back to Dāśarathi.”
'23': >-
  Hearing Vibhīṣaṇa’s words, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, dismissed them all
  and entered his own palace.
'24': >-
  Thus ends the ninth chapter, entitled “The Counsel of Vibhīṣaṇa,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic.
