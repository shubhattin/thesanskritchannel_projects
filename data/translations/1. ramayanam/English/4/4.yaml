  Now begins the fourth canto, entitled “Going into Sugrīva’s Presence,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. (4.4)
'1': >-
  Thereupon Hanumān, greatly delighted, hearing those words—which were pleasing
  and sweet in import—went in his mind toward Sugrīva, thinking, “This is one
  who can accomplish what must be done.”
'2': >-
  For that great-souled Sugrīva, the gaining of his kingdom is indeed to be
  expected; for here has come one capable of accomplishing the task, and the
  very opportunity for that task has also presented itself.
'3': >-
  Then Hanumān, the foremost of the monkeys, exceedingly overjoyed, who was
  skilled in speech, replied in words to Rāma.
'4': >-
  “For what purpose have you, together with your younger brother, come into this
  dreadful forest—this inaccessible region, adorned with the groves of Pampā,
  and abounding in many kinds of beasts and serpents?”
'5': >-
  Hearing those words, Lakṣmaṇa—prompted by Rāma—made known the matter to that
  great-souled Rāma, son of Daśaratha, (so that it might be told to Hanumān).
'6': >-
  “There was a king named Daśaratha, radiant and devoted to righteousness, ever
  protecting the four castes according to their own duties.”
'7': >-
  “There was none who hated him, and he hated no one. To all beings he was like
  another grandsire (Brahmā) in his care.”
'8': >-
  “By sacrifices such as the Agniṣṭoma and the rest, performed with fitting
  gifts (to priests), he had worshipped. Of him, this elder son is famed among
  men by the name Rāma.”
'9': >-
  “He is a refuge for all beings, and fully accomplished in carrying out his
  father’s command. Of Daśaratha’s sons, this one is the eldest and the most
  endowed with excellence.”
'10': >-
  “Possessed of the marks of royalty and united with royal prosperity, yet
  fallen from the kingdom, he has come here to dwell in the forest, along with
  me.”
'11': >-
  “He is followed by his noble wife Sītā; self-controlled, of great splendour,
  he shines at the close of day like the Sun with its radiance.”
'12': >-
  “I am his younger brother, who by my qualities have come to the state of
  serving him—Lakṣmaṇa by name—grateful and greatly learned.”
'13': >-
  “Though worthy of happiness and of the highest honours, benevolent to all
  beings, bereft of sovereignty, he yet delights in dwelling in the forest.”
'14': >-
  “His wife has been carried off by a rākṣasa, one who ranged at will in an
  uninhabited place; yet it is not known which rākṣasa it was by whom his
  consort was taken.”
'15': >-
  “There is a son of Diti named Danu, who, by a curse, attained the state of a
  rākṣasa. By him Sugrīva, the capable lord of the monkeys, was declared (to
  us).”
'16': >-
  “That mighty-valoried Sugrīva will discover the one who carried away your
  wife. Saying thus, Danu—shining—went up to heaven and attained the celestial
  world.”
'17': >-
  “All this has been told to you, exactly as it is, since you asked. Thus I and
  Rāma have come seeking refuge in Sugrīva.”
'18': >-
  “This Rāma—who in former days was lord of the world, bestowing riches and
  winning unsurpassed fame—now desires Sugrīva as his protector.”
'19': >-
  “He whose daughter-in-law Sītā was, who is a refuge and devoted to dharma—his
  son also, a refuge to others, has come seeking refuge in Sugrīva.”
'20': >-
  “The righteous-souled Rāghava, the refuge of the whole world—formerly himself
  a refuge—he is my teacher; and he has come seeking refuge in Sugrīva.”
'21': >-
  “By whose grace these subjects would always prosper—this Rāma now seeks the
  favour of the lord of monkeys.”
'22': >-
  “He by whom all kings on earth, endowed with every virtue, were ever
  honoured—indeed by King Daśaratha always—”
'23': >-
  “—of him this elder son, renowned in the three worlds, has come seeking refuge
  in Sugrīva, the lord of monkeys.”
'24': >-
  “When Rāma, overcome by sorrow, has come as one afflicted with grief seeking
  refuge, Sugrīva, together with his troop-leaders, ought to show him favour.”
'25': >-
  While Saumitrī (Lakṣmaṇa) spoke thus—piteously, with tears falling—Hanumān,
  skilled in speech, replied to him with these words:
'26': >-
  “Indeed, such men—endowed with discernment, having conquered anger, having
  conquered the senses—are to be seen by the lord of monkeys. By good fortune
  you have come within his sight.”
'27': >-
  “For he too has been deprived of his kingdom, has incurred enmity with Vālin,
  has had his wife taken away, lives terrified in the forest, and has been
  grievously wronged by his own brother.”
'28': >-
  “That son of the Sun, Sugrīva, together with us, will render assistance to you
  both in the search for Sītā.”
'29': >-
  Having spoken thus, Hanumān, in gentle words with a sweet voice, addressed
  Rāghava: “Well then—let us go to Sugrīva.”
'30': >-
  As Hanumān, righteous in conduct, spoke thus, Lakṣmaṇa—having honoured him in
  accordance with propriety—said this to Rāghava:
'31': >-
  “This monkey speaks joyfully—this son of the Wind—as one who is capable. He
  too has arrived, a doer of what must be done. You are now one whose purpose is
  accomplished, O Rāghava.”
'32': >-
  “His face is serene in complexion, and he speaks with evident delight. That
  hero Hanumān, the son of the Wind, will not speak untruth.”
'33': >-
  Then that exceedingly wise Hanumān, the son of the Wind, taking the two
  heroes, led those Rāghavas to the king of monkeys.
'34': >-
  Casting aside the guise of a mendicant and assuming his monkey form, that
  elephant among monkeys placed the two heroes upon his back and went on.
'35': >-
  That eminent monkey-hero, the son of the Wind—of wide fame—rejoicing as one
  whose task was achieved, proceeded with great prowess to the excellent
  mountain, accompanied by Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, being of auspicious mind.
'36': >-
  Thus ends the fourth canto, entitled “Going into Sugrīva’s Presence,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic. (4.4)
