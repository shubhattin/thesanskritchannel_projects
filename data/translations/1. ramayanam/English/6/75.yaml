  Now begins the seventy-fifth chapter, named “The Burning of Lanka,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Thereupon Sugrīva, lord of the Vānaras, possessed of great splendor, addressed
  Hanūmān—making known what was to be done—saying these words:
'2': >-
  “Since Kumbhakarṇa has been slain, and the princes also have been destroyed,
  Rāvaṇa does not now deserve to be granted any respite or interval (for
  recovery and renewed resistance).”
'3': >-
  “Let all the monkeys who are mighty in strength and swift of movement fall
  upon Laṅkā at once, O bull among the Vānaras, taking flaming brands in their
  hands.”
'4': >-
  Then, when the Sun had set and that dreadful night had begun, those foremost
  of Vānara warriors, bearing burning torches, set forth facing toward Laṅkā.
'5': >-
  Assailed from every side by bands of monkeys with blazing brands in their
  hands, the guards posted for defense—grim and grotesque-eyed—suddenly fled in
  panic.
'6': >-
  On gate-towers, lofty terraces, ramparts, and diverse streets, and upon
  palaces as well, those exhilarated Vānaras hurled fire everywhere.
'7': >-
  Then the fire-god consumed thousands of their houses, and palace-mansions
  shaped like mountains came crashing down upon the earth.
'8': >-
  There, aloe-wood (aguru) burned, and precious sandalwood of exquisite
  fragrance; pearls and glossy gems, diamonds too, and coral likewise were
  consumed.
'9': >-
  Fine linen also burned there, and splendid silk; various woolens and
  sheep’s-wool fabrics; and vessels of gold, and weapons as well, were scorched.
'10': >-
  There burned trappings of horses of many fashioned forms, and ornaments for
  the neck and girths of elephants, and well-wrought equipment of chariots.
'11': >-
  The armor of warriors burned, and the protective mail of elephants and horses;
  swords, bows, bowstrings, arrows, javelins, goads, and spears were also
  consumed.
'12': >-
  Hides made of hair and of tail-hair, tiger-skins, and many kinds of leather
  also burned; and pearl-and-gem-bedecked mansions on every side were likewise
  set aflame.
'13': >-
  There indeed the fire burned up collections of many kinds of weapons; and then
  the fire-god consumed variegated and wondrous houses of many sorts.
'14': >-
  He burned the dwellings of the Rākṣasas—all of them greedy for houses and
  possessions—those who wore golden, ornamented armor, garlands, rich goods, and
  fine garments.
'15': >-
  He burned the homes of those whose eyes were reddened from drinking strong
  liquor, who moved with the staggering gait of intoxication, who wore garments
  hanging gracefully, and who were inflamed with anger born of hostility toward
  their foes.
'16': >-
  He burned the abodes of those with clubs, tridents, and swords in their
  hands—even as they were eating and drinking—those asleep upon costly beds
  together with their beloved women.
'17': >-
  As they fled in terror, swiftly carrying their children in every direction,
  the inhabitants of Laṅkā—countless, by hundreds of thousands—were thrown into
  confusion.
'18': >-
  There the fire burned them, flaring up again and again; and lofty
  residences—solidly built, with deep and weighty excellences—were repeatedly
  consumed.
'19': >-
  There were mansions with crescent-moon and half-moon ornaments of gold, with
  lofty moon-pavilions, with painted lattice-windows, and with firm foundations
  in every place.
'20': >-
  Adorned with gems and coral, as though they touched the very Sun; and resonant
  with the sounds of ornaments and of vīṇās like those of the krauñca and
  peacock—such houses the fire consumed.
'21': >-
  Those mansion-houses, mountain-like in their grandeur, resounded as the fire
  burned them; and gateways surrounded by flame shone brilliantly.
'22': >-
  Like masses of clouds bound about with lightning in the heat of summer, the
  houses encircled by fire blazed forth in radiance.
'23': >-
  As peaks of a great mountain blaze in a forest-conflagration, so too were the
  sleeping noblewomen in aerial mansions burned.
'24': >-
  Casting away their ornaments in that calamity, crying aloud “Alas! Alas!”,
  they wailed; and there, buildings wrapped in fire also fell down.
'25': >-
  Like mountain peaks struck down by Indra’s thunderbolt, those mansions, as
  they burned, shone from afar in their ruin.
'26': >-
  Like the snow-white summits of Himavān now all ablaze everywhere, even the
  high roofs of palaces—burning and kindled with tongues of flame—were seen.
'27': >-
  At night that Laṅkā appeared as though decked with blooming kiṃśuka flowers.
  With elephants loosed from their drivers and with horses set free as well,
  Laṅkā became like the ocean at the end of the world, with its sea-creatures
  bewildered and whirling in terror.
'28': >-
  Seeing an elephant released, a horse in one place, frightened, would shrink
  away; and seeing a frightened elephant, elsewhere the horse would turn back in
  fear.
'29': >-
  As Laṅkā burned, the great ocean shone resplendent, its waters joined with the
  red reflection—like a sea whose waves are tinged with blood.
'30': >-
  In but a moment that city was set ablaze by the Vānaras, like the earth itself
  ignited at the dreadful dissolution of the world.
'31': >-
  The loud cries of the multitude of women—whose voices filled the air amid the
  smoke—and the roaring of the fire’s fierce heat were heard for a hundred
  yojanas.
'32': >-
  Seeing the Rākṣasas, their bodies scorched, fleeing outside, the monkeys,
  eager for battle, suddenly leapt up to engage.
'33': >-
  The shouting of the Vānaras and the tumultuous din of the Rākṣasas made
  resound the ten directions, the ocean, and the earth as well.
'34': >-
  Then those two great-souled brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—unbewildered and
  steadfast—took up their two excellent bows.
'35': >-
  Thereafter Rāma twanged his supreme bow; and a tremendous sound arose,
  terrifying to the Rākṣasas.
'36': >-
  Then Rāma appeared resplendent as he twanged that mighty bow—like the blessed
  Lord Bhava (Śiva) in wrath, grasping the Veda-formed bow.
'37': >-
  The uproar of the Vānaras and the din of the Rākṣasas—those two
  sounds—together with the sharp sound of Rāma’s bowstring were heard.
'38': >-
  The cry of the Vānaras, the tumult of the Rākṣasas, and the bowstring’s twang
  of Rāma—these three filled the ten directions.
'39': >-
  By arrows released from his bow, the gateway and ramparts of that city—like
  the peak of Mount Kailāsa—were shattered and strewn upon the ground.
'40': >-
  Then, seeing Rāma’s arrows striking in aerial cars and in houses, a tumultuous
  arming arose among the lords of the Rākṣasas.
'41': >-
  As they armed themselves and uttered lion-roars, the night of the Rākṣasa
  chiefs became as though fierce and terrible.
'42': >-
  Commanded by the great-souled Sugrīva, those monkey-lords, reaching the gate
  that was near at hand, were told: “Fight, O Plavaṅgamas!”
'43': >-
  “And whoever, being present there and there, should act falsely (disobeying or
  failing in the command), he must be slain at once, for he corrupts the royal
  mandate.”
'44': >-
  When those foremost Vānaras, their hands shining with blazing brands, stood
  taking position at the gate, wrath entered into Rāvaṇa.
'45': >-
  From the stretching and tossing of his limbs, the ten directions seemed
  confounded; upon his body there appeared, as it were, the visible fury of
  Rudra embodied.
'46': >-
  In anger he dispatched Kumbha and Nikumbha, the two sons of Kumbhakarṇa,
  together with many Rākṣasas.
'47': >-
  Yūpākṣa, Śoṇitākṣa, Prajaṅgha, and Kampana likewise went forth with those sons
  of Kumbhakarṇa, by Rāvaṇa’s command.
'48': >-
  And he commanded all those mighty Rākṣasas: “Go this very day, roaring with
  lion-cries!”
'49': >-
  Then, urged by him, those heroic Rākṣasas, their weapons blazing, poured out
  of Laṅkā, roaring again and again.
'50': >-
  With the radiance from their own ornaments on every side, and with the fires
  borne by the monkeys, they made the sky luminous and glowing.
'51': >-
  There the splendor of the lord of stars (the Moon), the radiance of the stars,
  and the glitter of their ornaments—burning bright—illuminated the heavens.
'52': >-
  Moonlight, the shine of ornaments, and the glow of the blazing planets—these
  made the armies of monkeys and Rākṣasas shine everywhere.
'53': >-
  And there, with half-burning houses, the ocean—its waters joined with those
  reflections and its waves in motion—shone even more brilliantly.
'54': >-
  That fearful Rākṣasa host was seen, arrayed with banners and standards,
  bearing excellent swords and axes, with terrifying horses, chariots, and
  elephants, and crowded with many kinds of foot-soldiers.
'55': >-
  It bristled with flaming tridents, clubs, swords, spears, javelins, and
  bows—that dreadful Rākṣasa force, of grim valor and terrible prowess.
'56': >-
  It was seen with spears blazing, resonant with the sound of hundreds of
  tinkling bells, with arms covered in nets of gold, and with axes brandished
  and whirled about.
'57': >-
  It surged with great weapons in whirling motion, bows fitted with arrows; and
  a mighty wind, pleased by the sprinkling of perfume, garlands, and honey-wine,
  blew about it.
'58': >-
  Terrible, crowded with heroes, and roaring like a great rain-cloud—seeing that
  force of the Rākṣasas advancing, hard to withstand,
'59': >-
  the army of monkeys was stirred and roared aloud; and leaping swiftly again
  and again, it rushed against that vast host of Rākṣasas,
'60': >-
  as moths rush headlong toward fire—so did they advance upon the enemy force.
  The Rākṣasas’ array, with iron bars and thunderbolt-like blows, was struck and
  grappled at close quarters.
'61': >-
  The foremost force of the Rākṣasas then shone forth once more exceedingly; and
  the monkeys, eager to fight, sprang up as though maddened.
'62': >-
  Striking the night-rangers with trees and rocks, and with their fists as well,
  the monkeys fell upon them; and as those monkeys charged, sharp arrows met
  them.
'63': >-
  Then the Rākṣasas of dreadful prowess suddenly severed heads. Some had their
  ears torn off by bites; some had their skulls split by fists; others had their
  limbs broken by blows of stones—thus the Rākṣasas moved about there in ruin.
'64': >-
  So too, other terrible night-rangers, with sharp swords, struck down the
  foremost monkeys all around.
'65': >-
  One who was slaying another was himself slain; one who was felling another was
  felled in turn; one who was reproaching was reproached by another; one who was
  biting was bitten back by another.
'66': >-
  “Give!” said one; another replied, “I give!” yet another again said, “I will
  give!” and another said, “Why do you torment me? Stand still!”—thus they spoke
  to one another there amid the fray.
'67': >-
  Weapons were frustrated and thrown aside; armor, weapons, and gear were cast
  off; huge spears were raised aloft; and there was a mêlée of fists, tridents,
  swords, and javelins.
'68': >-
  A most dreadful battle then arose between monkeys and Rākṣasas. The Rākṣasas
  slew in combat ten, then seven monkeys,
'69': >-
  and the monkeys likewise struck down ten, then seven Rākṣasas. Seizing upon
  that Rākṣasa force—its garments torn away, its armor and standards cast
  off—the monkeys surrounded it on every side.
'70': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-fifth chapter, named “The Burning of Laṅkā,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
