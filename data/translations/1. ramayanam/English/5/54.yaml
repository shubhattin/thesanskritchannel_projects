  Now begins the fifty-fourth canto, named “The Burning of Laṅkā,” in the
  auspicious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa.
'1': >-
  Thereafter, that monkey, gazing upon Laṅkā, his purpose accomplished, with his
  zeal ever increasing, began to reflect upon what yet remained to be done.
'2': >-
  “What indeed still remains for me to do here at this moment—by which there
  might again arise still greater torment for these rākṣasas?”
'3': >-
  “The grove has already been laid waste; the foremost rākṣasas have been slain;
  a portion of their forces has been destroyed; what remains is the destruction
  of their fortress.”
'4': >-
  “When the stronghold is destroyed, the task will have borne fruit with easy
  exertion; with little effort in this undertaking, my labor will become truly
  successful.”
'5': >-
  “And this fire—Havyavāhana—burning upon my tail: it is fitting to have it
  satisfied by means of these excellent houses.”
'6': >-
  Then the great monkey, his tail ablaze, like a rain-cloud lit by lightning,
  ranged over the rooftops of Laṅkā.
'7': >-
  That vānara, looking about fearlessly, went from house to house of the
  rākṣasas, and through their gardens as well; and he also traversed their
  palaces.
'8': >-
  Leaping with mighty speed to the residence of Prahasta, he placed fire there;
  and that powerful one was like the very Wind in his breathing.
'9': >-
  Then the valiant Hanumān sprang to the mansion of Mahāpārśva, and released
  there a fire like the flame of the cosmic conflagration.
'10': >-
  In like manner that great monkey leapt to the house of Vajradaṃṣṭra; and also
  to those of Śuka, and of Sāraṇa the wise, possessed of great splendor.
'11': >-
  So too the leader of the monkey-host burned the dwelling of Indrajit; then he
  burned the houses of Jambumālī and of Sumāli as well.
'12': >-
  He also burned the residence of Raśmiketū, and likewise of Sūryaśatru; and of
  Hrāsvakarṇa, and of Daṃṣṭra, and of the rākṣasa Romaśa.
'13': >-
  And of Yuddhonmatta, and of Matta, and of the rākṣasa Dhvajagrīva; and of the
  dreadful Vidyujjihva, and of Hastimukha as well.
'14': >-
  And of Karāla, and of Viśāla, and indeed of Śoṇitākṣa; and the mansion of
  Kumbhakarṇa, and likewise of Makarākṣa.
'15': >-
  And of Narāntaka, of Kumbha, and of the evil-souled Nikumbha; and the house of
  Yajñaśatru, and likewise of Brahmaśatru.
'16': >-
  But sparing the house of the great-souled Vibhīṣaṇa, the foremost of monkeys,
  advancing in due order from one to the next, set them ablaze.
'17': >-
  In those and those noble mansions, the illustrious elephant among monkeys
  burned up the prosperity of prosperous households.
'18': >-
  Having passed beyond the dwellings of all the rākṣasa chiefs, that valiant one
  at last reached the residence of Rāvaṇa, resplendent with royal fortune.
'19': >-
  Then, in that foremost palace, adorned with many kinds of jewels, resembling
  Meru or Mandara, and beautified by diverse auspicious emblems,
'20': >-
  he cast forth the blazing fire fixed at the tip of his tail; and the heroic
  Hanumān roared like a cloud at the end of an age.
'21': >-
  By contact with his breath, that fire, mighty and exceedingly swift, blazed up
  like the fire of Time and grew in intensity.
'22': >-
  Driven and carried by the wind, the blazing fire coursed through those
  mansions—through those golden latticed windows and through those structures
  made of pearls and gems.
'23': >-
  Those great jewel-filled palaces were shattered; their broken aerial mansions
  fell down upon the surface of the earth.
'24': >-
  As when the merit of the Siddhas is exhausted and their palaces fall from
  heaven, so arose a tumultuous sound—of the rākṣasas fleeing in all directions.
'25': >-
  In the effort to save their own homes—those whose zeal was broken and whose
  splendor was lost—cried, “Surely this fire has come in the form of a
  monkey—alas!”
'26': >-
  Women, with infants at their breasts, suddenly fell, wailing; some, their
  limbs encircled by flames, leapt from the terraces with their hair loosened.
'27': >-
  As they fell, they shone against the clouds like lightning in the sky, bearing
  ornaments set with diamonds, coral, vaidūrya (cat’s-eye), pearls, and silver.
'28': >-
  He beheld varied streams of molten metals flowing down from the splendid
  houses; and just as fire is not satisfied by wood and grass, so too it was
  here.
'29': >-
  So also Hanumān was in no way satisfied with the slaying of the rākṣasa lords;
  nor was the earth satisfied with the rākṣasas slain by Hanumān.
'30': >-
  By that swift and great-souled vānara Hanumān, the city of Laṅkā was
  burned—just as Tripura was burned by Rudra.
'31': >-
  Then that dreadful, mighty fire, rising upon the mountain-like heights of the
  city of Laṅkā—set in motion by swift Hanumān—spread out its blazing circle
  like a crown.
'32': >-
  Like the fire of dissolution at the end of an age, fanned by the wind, the
  flame grew until it touched the very sky; its rays were smoke-free, clinging
  to the houses, its tongues of fire fed as though by offerings of rākṣasa
  bodies.
'33': >-
  That great fire, of splendid radiance like a myriad suns, stood encircling all
  Laṅkā; with many sounds, as though charged with thunderbolts, it seemed to be
  splitting the very cosmic shell.
'34': >-
  There, the fire—exceedingly increased, harsh in brilliance, crowned with the
  red of kiṃśuka blossoms—rose upward, while clouds, dark like blue lotuses,
  appeared with their streaks confused amid the smoke of the blaze.
'35': >-
  “Is this the thunderbolt-wielding Mahendra, lord of the gods? Or is it Yama
  himself, or Varuṇa, or Anila? Is it Rudra, or Agni, or the Sun, or Kubera, or
  Soma? Surely this is no monkey—this is Time itself!”
'36': >-
  “Or has the wrath that brings about the destruction of the rākṣasas come
  here—assuming the form of a monkey—of Brahmā, the grandsire of all, the
  four-faced creator and support of the worlds?”
'37': >-
  “Or has the supreme, exceedingly radiant Viṣṇu-power, taking a monkey’s form
  for the destruction of the rākṣasas, come now—by its own māyā—unthinkable,
  unmanifest, endless, one?”
'38': >-
  Thus spoke many distinguished rākṣasas, all assembled there, beholding at once
  that city—its creatures, its houses, its trees—consumed by fire.
'39': >-
  Then Laṅkā, suddenly burned—together with rākṣasas, horses and chariots,
  elephants; together with flocks of birds, with deer, with trees—lamented
  piteously with a tumultuous sound.
'40': >-
  “Alas, father! Alas, child! Beloved! Friend! Alas, dear life! Our great merit
  is destroyed!”—as rākṣasas cried thus in many ways, a sound more dreadful and
  terrifying was raised.
'41': >-
  Covered by the tongues of flame, deprived of her heroes, her warriors
  scattered and overthrown, Laṅkā—overpowered by the force of Hanumān’s
  wrath—became as though smitten by a curse.
'42': >-
  Hanumān, great-minded, beheld Laṅkā—her rākṣasas in panic, terrified and
  despondent, marked by blazing tongues of fire—like the earth afflicted by the
  wrath of the Self-born (Brahmā).
'43': >-
  Having broken the grove thick with jewel-like trees, having slain mighty
  rākṣasas in battle, and having burned that city garlanded with rows of
  splendid houses, Hanumān, son of the Wind, stood firm.
'44': >-
  Having slain very many of those rākṣasas, and having shattered that forest
  with its many trees, and having set fire among the rākṣasas’ houses, that
  great-souled one turned his mind toward going to Rāma.
'45': >-
  Then all the hosts of the gods praised that foremost heroic monkey—of great
  strength, with speed equal to the wind, highly intelligent—Hanumān, the best
  of the sons of Vāyu.
'46': >-
  And all the gods, and the foremost sages, and the Gandharvas, Vidyādharas, and
  Nāgas, and all the great beings there attained supreme and incomparable joy.
'47': >-
  Having shattered the grove, the mighty one; having slain the rākṣasas in
  battle; and having burned the terrible city of Laṅkā— that great monkey shone
  in splendor.
'48': >-
  Standing upon the wondrous summit of a palace-roof, the lion among
  monkey-kings—his blazing tail forming a garland of flame—shone like the sun
  wreathed in rays of light.
'49': >-
  Having crushed and scorched all of Laṅkā with the fire upon his tail, that
  great monkey, the foremost of Hari-kind, then quenched it in the ocean.
'50': >-
  Thereupon the gods, along with the Gandharvas, and the Siddhas and the great
  seers—seeing that Laṅkā thus burned—were filled with the highest astonishment.
'51': >-
  Seeing that foremost of monkeys, Hanumān the great monkey, all beings
  trembled, deeming him to be the fire of Time at the end of the age.
'52': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fourth canto, named “The Burning of Laṅkā,” in
  Sundara-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
