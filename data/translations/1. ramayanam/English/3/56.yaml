  Now begins the fifty-sixth canto, named “The Episode Concerning the Passing of
  a Year,” in the Aranya Kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana.
'1': >-
  When Sita had been brought into Lanka, then the Grandsire (Brahma) spoke to
  Devendra, Shatakratu, who was well-pleased.
'2': >-
  “For the welfare of the three worlds, and also for the destruction of the
  rakshasas’ welfare (i.e., for their undoing), Sita has been led into Lanka by
  the evil-souled Ravana.”
'3': >-
  “She is a devoted wife, most fortunate, and ever accustomed to comfort; yet
  she does not behold her lord, and instead beholds only the throngs of
  rakshasas.”
'4': >-
  “Surrounded by rakshasi women, longing for the sight of her husband, she
  remains within the city of Lanka, which is situated on the shore of the lord
  of rivers and streams (the ocean).”
'5': >-
  “How will Rama come to know of that blameless lady abiding there? As she
  broods again and again on sorrow, she is exceedingly difficult to reach.”
'6': >-
  “Not sustaining her life, she will surely abandon her very breath. Thus again
  a doubt has arisen regarding the ending of Sita’s life.”
'7': >-
  “Therefore, go quickly from here; behold Sita of auspicious countenance. Enter
  the city of Lanka and give her the choicest oblation (havis).”
'8': >-
  Thus addressed, Devendra—the blessed Lord, the chastiser of Paka—went to the
  city guarded by Ravana, accompanied by Nidra (Sleep).
'9': >-
  And he said to Nidra, “Go—delude the rakshasas.” Thus commanded by Maghavat,
  the goddess (Nidra) was exceedingly delighted.
'10': >-
  In order to accomplish the purpose of the gods, she cast a deep delusion upon
  the rakshasas. Meanwhile, the god Thousand-eyed, the husband of Sachi,
'11': >-
  approached that lady dwelling in the grove and spoke these words: “I am the
  king of the gods—may good befall you; and I am here, O you of pure smile.”
'12': >-
  “For the successful accomplishment of the purpose of the great-souled Raghava,
  I shall render you aid. Do not grieve, O daughter of Janaka.”
'13': >-
  “By my grace, he will cross the ocean along with his forces; and here, O
  auspicious one, the rakshasi women have been deluded by me through my own
  power of illusion.”
'14': >-
  “Therefore, O Sita, I myself have brought this food, fit for an oblation—this
  sacrificial fare; and, O Vaidehi, having gathered it, I have come here
  together with Nidra.”
'15': >-
  “You shall eat this from my hand, O auspicious one; it will not trouble you.
  Hunger and thirst will not afflict you—even for tens of thousands of years, O
  lady with thighs like the plantain-stem.”
'16': >-
  Thus spoken to, she, full of doubt, addressed Devendra: “How am I to know you,
  O Devendra, as Sachi’s lord, present here?”
'17': >-
  “I have seen the marks of the gods when I was near Rama and Lakshmana. Show
  those signs, O Devendra, if you truly are the king of the gods yourself.”
'18': >-
  Hearing Sita’s words, Sachi’s lord did so: he did not touch the earth with his
  feet, and his gaze was unblinking.
'19': >-
  He wore spotless garments, and his flowers were likewise unwithered. Knowing
  him by these signs to be Vasava (Indra), Sita was filled with joy.
'20': >-
  Weeping, she spoke these words, referring to Raghava: “O Blessed One, by good
  fortune the mighty-armed one, together with his brother, has reached my
  hearing.”
'21': >-
  “Just as my father-in-law the king, and just as the lord of Mithila (my
  father), so do I behold you today; through you my husband is not without
  protection.”
'22': >-
  “By your command, O Devendra, this oblation has become as milk; I shall
  partake of this, given by you, O increaser of the Raghu line.”
'23': >-
  Taking that rice-milk (payasa) from Indra’s hand, she of pure smile offered it
  (in intention) to her husband and also to Lakshmana—the Maithili.
'24': >-
  “If my husband lives, together with his mighty brother, let this be for them
  with devotion.” Having thus dedicated it, she herself ate the payasa.
'25': >-
  Thus, having eaten that oblation, the fair-faced lady cast off that suffering
  born of hunger and distress; and Janaki, obtaining tidings from Indra, became
  glad at heart regarding the two scions of Kakutstha.
'26': >-
  And Shakra too then, pleased for the accomplishment of Raghava’s purpose,
  departed to the abode of the thirty gods (heaven). Having taken leave of Sita,
  that great-souled one went thence to his own dwelling, together with Nidra.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-sixth canto, named “The Episode Concerning the Passing of
  a Year,” in the Aranya Kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the primordial
  epic.
