  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa,
  begins the tenth chapter, called “The Account of Banishment from the Kingdom.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, desiring his welfare, and seeking the good of my brother, I tried
  to appease him—him who was possessed by wrath, enraged, and who had come up to
  me in a fury.
'2': >-
  ‘By good fortune you have returned safe; and by you the enemy has been slain.
  For me, who was as one without a protector, you alone are my lord and refuge,
  O delight of the protectorless.’
'3': >-
  ‘Accept from me this many-spoked royal umbrella, risen like the full moon,
  together with fly-whisks, which I hold (for you).’
'4': >-
  ‘I stood at the entrance of that cave for a full year, O king; and I saw blood
  at the doorway, issuing forth from the cave as well.’
'5': >-
  ‘My heart tormented by grief, my senses exceedingly agitated, I then closed
  the mouth of the cave with a mountain-peak (a great crag).’
'6': >-
  ‘Departing from that place, I entered Kiṣkindhā again. Seeing me here
  downcast, the citizens and the ministers too—’
'7': >-
  ‘—anointed me as king, though not of my own desire. May you pardon me for
  that. You alone are fit to be king and worthy of honour; and I (shall remain)
  ever as before.’
'8': >-
  ‘This appointment of mine to the royal station was done because of your
  absence. The city with its ministers and citizens remained established, its
  thorns (its dangers and disturbers) removed.’
'9': >-
  ‘This kingdom has been held in trust; I now restore it to you. Do not, gentle
  one, give way to anger—O slayer of foes.’
'10': >-
  ‘I entreat you, O king, bowing my head; my hands are joined in reverence.
  Having come here by force, together with the ministers and the inhabitants of
  the city—’
'11': >-
  ‘—I was installed in the royal state, with the wish to protect and win back
  the leaderless realm.’ Thus I, speaking in this friendly manner—him, the
  monkey—(yet) he reviled.
'12': >-
  Saying, ‘Shame on you!’ he spoke many such harsh words to me; and having
  summoned the chiefs of the people and the ministers held in esteem,
'13': >-
  he addressed to me, in the midst of friends, a speech most blameworthy: ‘It is
  known to you all how, at night, that great demon Māyāvī—’
'14': >-
  ‘—once, in anger, challenged me, desiring battle. Hearing his words, I came
  out from the royal dwelling.’
'15': >-
  ‘And this my brother—most dreadful in valour—followed me swiftly. But that
  mighty one (the foe), seeing me at night accompanied by a second—’
'16': >-
  ‘—fled in fear on seeing the two of us approach, and, running at speed,
  entered a huge cave.’
'17': >-
  ‘Knowing that he had entered that most terrible, very great cave, my brother
  then said to me—while I, of grim aspect—’
'18': >-
  ‘—(resolved): “I have no power to return to the city from here without slaying
  him. You wait at the mouth of the cave until I kill him.”’
'19': >-
  ‘Thinking, “He is standing here,” I entered that hard-to-assail place; and
  while I searched for him there, a year passed.’
'20': >-
  ‘Then I saw that fearful enemy, and, without desponding, I immediately slew
  him, together with all his kinsmen.’
'21': >-
  ‘And that cave, filled with a flood of blood issuing from his mouth as he
  roared upon the ground, became completely full—impassable.’
'22': >-
  ‘Having slain that valiant foe, I sought with ease to come out, but I did not
  see the cave’s mouth, for it had been blocked.’
'23': >-
  ‘And though I cried out again and again, “Sugrīva! Sugrīva!”, since there was
  no reply in return, I was plunged into extreme sorrow.’
'24': >-
  ‘With many kicks struck by me, that obstruction was shattered and made to fall
  away. Then, coming out by that way, I reached the city.’
'25': >-
  ‘There I was barred (from entry), while seeking my own kingdom, by Sugrīva the
  cruel—he having forgotten brotherly affection.’
'26': >-
  Having spoken thus, Vālī then, fearless, drove me into exile there with but a
  single garment.
'27': >-
  Thus was I cast out, and my wife was taken from me, O Rāghava; and from fear
  of him I traversed the whole earth, together with its forests and oceans.
'28': >-
  Sorrowing from the abduction of my wife, I entered the excellent mountain
  Ṛṣyamūka—hard to assail—for another reason: (namely) because of Vālī.
'29': >-
  This whole great account has been told to you—the full narration of the
  enmity. Behold, O Rāghava, the calamity that has come upon me though I am
  without offence.
'30': >-
  Therefore, out of fear of Vālī—O heroic one, remover of fear for all the
  worlds—you should grant me your favour by restraining him (and bringing him
  down).
'31': >-
  Thus addressed, that radiant one, knower of dharma, began to speak words in
  accordance with dharma to Sugrīva, smiling as it were.
'32': >-
  “These my arrows are unfailing, sharp, and radiant as the sun. They shall
  fall, filled with wrath, upon that wicked Vālī.”
'33': >-
  “So long as I do not behold him who has stolen your wife—Vālī, that sinner who
  defiles good conduct—so long shall he not be allowed to live.”
'34': >-
  “From your very condition I see you sunk in an ocean of grief. I shall surely
  deliver you; you shall indeed obtain abundant good (success and prosperity).”
'35': >-
  Hearing those words, which increased his joy and manly courage, Sugrīva,
  exceedingly delighted, spoke this very great reply:
'36': >-
  Thus ends the tenth chapter, called “The Account of Banishment from the
  Kingdom,” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the
  Ādi-kāvya.
