  Now begins the twenty-fourth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Rāvaṇa’s Vow.”
'1': >-
  That royal host of heroes, thus arrayed under the king’s command, shone forth
  splendidly—like an autumnal full-moon night adorned with auspicious
  constellations, radiant with the moon.
'2': >-
  And the earth itself began to tremble and move in agitation, terrified as it
  were, being oppressed by that massed army whose splendour was like the
  ocean’s.
'3': >-
  Then the forest-dwelling monkeys heard, within Laṅkā, a loud outcry—resounding
  with the tumult of kettledrums and mṛdaṅga-drums—terrible, and causing the
  hairs to stand on end.
'4': >-
  By that clamour the leaders of the monkey-troops became exhilarated; and,
  unable to endure that sound, they raised cries still louder in reply.
'5': >-
  The rākṣasas too heard the roaring of those monkeys—like the thunder of proud
  clouds sounding in the sky.
'6': >-
  Seeing Laṅkā of the son of Daśaratha—adorned with varied banners and
  pennons—his mind went to Sītā, and his heart was pained within him.
'7': >-
  “Here that doe-eyed lady is being confined by Rāvaṇa—like Rohiṇī oppressed by
  the red-bodied planet (Mars).”
'8': >-
  Then the hero, breathing out long and hot sighs, and looking again at
  Lakṣmaṇa, spoke words timely and beneficial for that moment.
'9': >-
  “Behold, Lakṣmaṇa, how Laṅkā stands upraised, as though it were outlining the
  very sky—Laṅkā that seems fashioned by the mind itself, as if by Viśvakarmā
  upon the summit of a mountain.”
'10': >-
  “Laṅkā is crowded with many aerial cars (vimānas), wondrously constructed of
  old—like the sky covered with pale clouds, resembling Viṣṇu’s own footstep
  (the all-pervading firmament).”
'11': >-
  “Laṅkā is beautified with flowering forests, charming like the gardens of
  Citraratha—auspicious groves filled with fruits and blossoms, resounding with
  flocks of diverse birds.”
'12': >-
  “See the intoxicated birds, and the bees that are swarming and settling; the
  breezes, auspicious in their touch, make the groves thronged with cuckoos
  tremble and murmur.”
'13': >-
  Thus Rāma, son of Daśaratha, spoke to Lakṣmaṇa; and there he apportioned the
  forces according to the proper procedure laid down in the śāstras (treatises
  of war).
'14': >-
  The mighty Angada, taking charge of that monkey-army with strength, issued
  commands; and he—invincible—took his stand at the front together with Nīla.
'15': >-
  The vānara named Ṛṣabha, surrounded by great masses of monkeys, took position
  on the right flank of the monkey host.
'16': >-
  The powerful Gandhamādana—hard to assail like an elephant in rut—took position
  on the left flank of the monkey host.
'17': >-
  “I shall stand at the head (the vanguard), accompanied by Lakṣmaṇa; and
  Jāmbavān, Suṣeṇa, and the monkey named Vegadarśī—these (three) shall be with
  me.”
'18': >-
  “Let those three great-souled chiefs among bears protect the middle; and let
  the king of monkeys guard the rear of the monkey-army—like Prajāpati (the Lord
  of creatures) enveloped in splendour, guarding as it were the world’s western
  quarter.”
'19': >-
  That army, with its great battle-array well distributed and protected by
  mighty monkeys, shone forth—like the sky filled and spread over with clouds.
'20': >-
  Then the monkeys advanced upon Laṅkā, eager to crush it in battle—seizing
  mountain-peaks and great trees in their hands.
'21': >-
  All those foremost among monkeys fixed their minds upon this: “We shall
  scatter and smash this Laṅkā with crags—or even with our fists!”
'22': >-
  Then the great-splendoured Rāma said this to Sugrīva: “The divisions of the
  army are well arranged; let this Śuka be set free.”
'23': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, Sugrīva, lord of the monkeys and of great strength,
  released that messenger Śuka, in obedience to Rāma’s command.
'24': >-
  Released by Rāma’s word—yet manhandled and crushed about by the monkeys—Śuka,
  exceedingly terrified, approached the lord of the rākṣasas.
'25': >-
  Rāvaṇa, laughing aloud, addressed Śuka, saying: “What has happened to your two
  white wings? You appear as though your wings have been shorn.”
'26': >-
  “Surely you have not fallen under the control of those fickle-minded ones,
  have you?” Thus pressed by the king, Śuka—shaken with fear—answered the
  foremost lord of rākṣasas:
'27': >-
  “On the northern shore of the ocean, I spoke to you those words exactly as
  your message required—without distress—seeking to conciliate them with smooth
  and gentle speech.”
'28': >-
  “But those enraged monkeys, leaping upon me, seized me the moment they saw me,
  and began to strike me, intending to kill me and pound me with their fists.”
'29': >-
  “It is not possible to reason with them; there is no inquiry or discussion
  there. By nature they are wrathful and fierce, O lord of rākṣasas.”
'30': >-
  “That Rāma—together with Sugrīva—who slew Vīrādha, Kabandha, and Khara as
  well, has now reached the place where Sītā is.”
'31': >-
  “Having built a bridge upon the sea and crossed the salt-ocean, that
  bow-bearing Rāghava stands there, intent on destroying the rākṣasas.”
'32': >-
  “Thousands upon thousands of divisions of bears and monkeys—like mountains and
  clouds in appearance—cover the face of the earth.”
'33': >-
  “Between the massed might of the rākṣasas and the strength of the monkey-lord
  there can be no truce—just as there is none between the gods and the dānavas.”
'34': >-
  “They are already coming quickly up to the ramparts. Do one of the two at
  once: either give Sītā back to him swiftly, or else let battle be given.”
'35': >-
  Hearing Śuka’s words, Rāvaṇa replied—his eyes reddened with wrath, as though
  he were burning with his gaze.
'36': >-
  “Even if the gods, gandharvas, and dānavas were to wage war against me, I
  would not give Sītā back—not even out of fear of all the worlds!”
'37': >-
  “When will my arrows rush upon Rāghava—like intoxicated bees upon a tree in
  spring, when it is in full blossom?”
'38': >-
  “When will I set him ablaze with arrows shot from my blazing bow—so that his
  limbs are smeared with blood—like a great elephant struck by fiery meteors?”
'39': >-
  “And I shall strip away his strength, surrounded by my vast forces—just as the
  rising Sun steals the radiance of all the stars.”
'40': >-
  “My speed is like the ocean’s surge; my strength is like the wind-god’s. The
  son of Daśaratha does not know this—yet he desires to fight me!”
'41': >-
  “Rāma has not seen, in battle, my arrows lying in the quiver—like serpents
  bearing venom; therefore he desires to fight me!”
'42': >-
  “That Rāghava does not yet know my former prowess in war—nor my bow which is
  like a vīṇā (lute), made to resound by the angles of my arrows.”
'43': >-
  “With the dreadful and tumultuous sound of the bowstring—like a great song of
  lamentation—like the clangour of arrow-heads, like a mighty river in full
  flood—entering the great arena of battle, I shall make it resound in war!”
'44': >-
  “Neither Vāsava (Indra) of the thousand eyes, nor Varuṇa himself, nor Yama,
  nor even Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera) again—none of them can overpower me in a great
  battle with the fire of arrows.”
'45': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fourth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “Rāvaṇa’s Vow.”
