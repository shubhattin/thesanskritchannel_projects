'0': >-
  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa,
  begins the fifty-first canto, called “The Narration of the Words of Durvāsas.”
'1': >-
  Thus urged on by the great-souled Lakṣmaṇa, the charioteer began to relate the
  very words that had been spoken by the sage.
'2': >-
  Formerly, the great sage Durvāsas—Atri’s son—dwelt for a year in the sacred
  hermitage of Vasiṣṭha.
'3': >-
  Then your father, of mighty splendor and great renown, came to that hermitage,
  desiring to see that great-souled Vasiṣṭha, his family priest.
'4': >-
  He beheld that great sage, radiant like the sun and blazing, as it were, with
  spiritual energy, seated at the left side of Vasiṣṭha.
'5': >-
  With humility, he saluted those two sages, the foremost among ascetics. The
  king was honored by them with words of welcome, a seat, water for washing the
  feet, and fruits and roots; and he sat with the sages.
'6': >-
  As they sat there, many exceedingly sweet conversations arose among those
  supreme seers, while the day passed on toward midday.
'7': >-
  Then, during a certain course of their discourse, the king, with joined palms
  and reverent composure, spoke to Atri’s son, that treasure of austerity, the
  great-souled Durvāsas.
'8': >-
  “O Blessed Lord, by what measure and in what manner shall my lineage endure?
  And what shall be the span of life of my son Rāma, and of my other sons—what
  shall their longevity be?”
'9': >-
  “And the sons that shall be born to Rāma—what shall be their length of days?
  Out of my desire to know, O Blessed One, tell me the future course of this my
  dynasty.”
'10': >-
  Hearing these words uttered by King Daśaratha, Durvāsas, of very great
  splendor, began to speak in reply.
'11': >-
  “Hear, O King, an ancient event from the war of the gods and the asuras. The
  daityas, being harried and reproached by the devas, sought refuge with the
  wife of Bhṛgu.”
'12': >-
  “Protected by her—she having granted them fearlessness—they dwelt there at
  that time without fear.”
'13': >-
  “Seeing them sheltered by her, Indra, lord of the gods, became wrathful, and
  with his sharp-edged discus he cut off the head of Bhṛgu’s wife.”
'14': >-
  “Then Bhṛgu, foremost of his line, on seeing his wife slain, in sudden anger
  cursed Viṣṇu, the destroyer of hostile hosts.”
'15': >-
  ‘Since, overcome by wrath, you have slain my wife who should not have been
  slain, therefore you shall be born in the world of men, O Janārdana.’
'16': ‘And there you shall suffer separation from your wife for many years.’
'17': >-
  Thus smitten by the curse, he became inwardly resolved and composed within
  himself.
'18': >-
  Then Bhṛgu, afflicted by his own curse, worshiped that Lord. The deity,
  pleased by austerity and compassionate to his devotee, spoke: “For the welfare
  of the worlds, this curse must indeed be accepted,” he said.
'19': >-
  “Thus was that mighty one formerly cursed by Bhṛgu in a prior birth; and now
  he has come here as your son, O best of kings.”
'20': >-
  “Known by the name Rāma and honored in the three worlds, he shall indeed
  experience the great consequence wrought by Bhṛgu’s curse.”
'21': >-
  “Rāma shall be lord of Ayodhyā for a long time; and those who follow him shall
  be happy and prosperous.”
'22': >-
  “For ten thousand years and ten hundreds of years besides, Rāma shall rule the
  kingdom, and then shall go to the world of Brahmā.”
'23': >-
  “And having performed abundant Aśvamedha sacrifices, being exceedingly hard to
  overcome, he shall establish many royal lines again and again.”
'24': >-
  “But two sons shall be born to Rāghava from Sītā—yet not in Ayodhyā. This is
  truth, without doubt.”
'25': “Thereafter, Rāghava shall consecrate those two sons of Sītā.”
'26': >-
  Having thus declared to the king the entire coming and going—the full future
  course—of his dynasty, that great and radiant sage fell silent.
'27': >-
  When that sage became silent, King Daśaratha, having bowed to both the
  great-souled sages, returned again to the best of cities.
'28': >-
  “This speech was formerly uttered there by the sage; I heard it and have
  stored it within my heart. It shall not turn out otherwise.”
'29': >-
  “Since this is so, you ought not to grieve, O Rāghava—whether for Sītā’s sake
  or for your own. Stand firm, O best of men.”
'30': >-
  Hearing the charioteer’s most marvelous account, Lakṣmaṇa obtained
  immeasurable joy and said, “Well spoken! Well spoken!”
'31': >-
  Then, as the charioteer and Lakṣmaṇa conversed thus upon the road, when the
  sun had set they halted for lodging and spent the night in Keśinī.
'32': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the
  fifty-first canto, called “The Narration of the Words of Durvāsas.”
