'0': >-
  Then, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Uttara-kanda, begins the
  seventy-eighth chapter, called “The Coming of the Ornaments.”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words spoken by me—O Rama, words of auspicious
  import—Raghunandana, that king who had attained heaven, with palms joined in
  reverence, answered thus.
'2': >-
  “Hear, O Brahmin, this ancient account of mine, of both my happiness and my
  sorrow—an account that must not be transgressed or concealed, since you ask
  me, O twice-born.”
'3': >-
  “Formerly there was the king of Vidarbha, my father, of great renown—Sudeva by
  name—celebrated in the three worlds and mighty in prowess.”
'4': >-
  “To him, O Brahmin, by two wives were born two sons. I was famed as Shveta;
  the younger became Suratha.”
'5': >-
  “Then, when my father had departed to heaven, the citizens anointed me as
  king; and there I ruled the kingdom, righteously and with a well-composed
  mind.”
'6': >-
  “Thus, O you of excellent vows, thousands of years passed while I administered
  the realm, O Brahmin, protecting the subjects according to dharma.”
'7': >-
  “Then, for a certain reason, having come to know that my lifespan was measured
  out, O best of twice-born, and fixing in my heart the law of Time (death’s
  ordinance), I went thereafter to the forest.”
'8': >-
  “I entered this difficult forest, bereft of beasts and birds, in order to
  practise austerity, near a fair and auspicious lake.”
'9': >-
  “Having installed my brother Suratha in the kingdom and anointed him as lord
  of the earth, I came to this lake and performed austerities for a long time.”
'10': >-
  “And I—having practised those extremely arduous austerities for three thousand
  years in the great forest—attained the unsurpassed world of Brahma.”
'11': >-
  “But while I dwelt in heaven, O best of Brahmins, hunger and thirst afflicted
  me, O supremely noble one. My senses being distressed, I went and spoke to the
  Grandsire, the foremost in the three worlds.”
'12': >-
  “‘O Blessed Lord, this world of Brahma is free from hunger and thirst. Of what
  deed is this the fruit, that I am attended by hunger and thirst?’”
'13': “‘What, then, is my food, O God? Tell me that, O Grandsire.’”
'14': >-
  “But the Grandsire said to me: ‘O son of Sudeva, your food is this—your own
  sweet flesh. Eat that continually.’”
'15': >-
  “‘Your own body, nourished by you while you performed the highest
  austerity—once consumed, grows again, O Shveta; it never fails to regenerate,
  O great-minded one.’”
'16': >-
  “‘No subtle satisfaction is yours, though you dwelt in a forest resorted to by
  living creatures. For formerly, when a mendicant asked of you, O king, you did
  not give alms to that ascetic; indeed, you did not give even to a guest, O
  Indra-like one.’”
'17': >-
  “‘Not even a small gift is found in you; you pursued austerity alone.
  Therefore, though you have gone to heaven, dear child, you are afflicted by
  hunger and thirst.’”
'18': >-
  “‘So you—having fed upon your own most excellent body, well-nourished by
  foods, tasting like nectar—shall thereby obtain satisfaction.’”
'19': >-
  “‘But when, O Shveta, the great sage Agastya, difficult to withstand, shall
  come to that forest, then you will be released from this hardship with
  difficulty.’”
'20': >-
  “‘For he, gentle one, is capable of delivering even hosts of gods—how much
  more you, O mighty-armed one, who have fallen under the sway of hunger and
  thirst!’”
'21': >-
  “Thus, having heard the decree of that Blessed One, of the God of gods, O best
  of twice-born, I accepted as food—though blameworthy—my own body.”
'22': >-
  “For many years, O Brahmin, I have been consuming it; yet it does not
  diminish, O Brahmarshi, and my satisfaction too becomes complete.”
'23': >-
  “But now, since this has become a grievous condition for me, release me from
  this hardship. Here there is no other refuge, O twice-born, except the son of
  the pot—Agastya.”
'24': >-
  “This ornament, gentle sir, is for the sake of my deliverance. Accept it, O
  best of Brahmins; may you be blessed—be pleased to show me grace.”
'25': >-
  “Here also is gold, and wealth, and garments, O twice-born; and food to be
  eaten and food to be enjoyed, O Brahmarshi; and he gives ornaments as well.”
'26': >-
  “All desires I grant, and enjoyments too, O foremost of sages. In delivering
  me, O Blessed One, be pleased to show me favor.”
'27': >-
  Hearing those words of the heaven-dweller, laden with sorrow, I accepted that
  excellent ornament in order to deliver him.
'28': >-
  And when that auspicious ornament had been received by me, the former human
  body of that royal sage perished.
'29': >-
  When his body had vanished, that royal sage—filled with the highest joy—sated
  and gladdened, went to the third heaven, in happiness.
'30': >-
  Therefore, O Kakutstha, this divine ornament, wondrous to behold, was given to
  me by him who was equal to Shakra, on that occasion and for that purpose.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-eighth chapter in the Uttara-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Adi-kavya, called “The Coming of the Ornaments.”
