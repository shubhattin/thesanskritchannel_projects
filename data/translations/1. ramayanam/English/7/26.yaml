'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-sixth sarga, called “The Curse of Nalakūbara.”
'1': >-
  Then that mighty Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa), endowed with great prowess, remaining
  there together with his army, chose a place of halt, when the sun had set.
'2': >-
  When the stainless moon had risen—shining with the splendour of a
  mountain—there lay asleep the vast host, furnished with weapons and missiles
  of many kinds.
'3': >-
  But Rāvaṇa, a great hero, sitting upon the crest of a mountain, beheld there
  the excellences of that place, beautified by moonlight and by trees.
'4': >-
  It was radiant with groves of karṇikāra trees and with dense thickets of
  kadamba; and with blooming lotus-ponds, and with the waters of the Mandākinī
  also.
'5': >-
  There were campaka, aśoka, and punnāga; and mandāra trees; and mango, pāṭala,
  and lodhra; and priyangu, arjuna, and ketaka; and tagara and nārikela
  (coconut), and priyāla and panas (jackfruit) likewise.
'6': >-
  There were also āragvadha and tamāla, and clusters of priyāla and vakula; with
  these and other trees the inner regions of the forest shone. There,
  Kinnaras—afflicted by love, enamoured, and sweet-voiced—
'7': sang together in harmony, increasing the delight of the mind.
'8': >-
  In that forest-region thus resplendent, Vidyādharas also—intoxicated with
  revelry, their eyes reddened with delight—along with women, sported, passed
  about, and indeed rejoiced.
'9': >-
  A sweet sound was heard, like the tinkling resonance of bells—the singing of
  companies of Apsarases in the abode of the Lord of wealth (Kubera).
'10': >-
  The mountains, struck by the wind, were shedding showers of flowers, fragrant
  with honey and spring-blossoms, as though they would perfume that mountain as
  a dwelling.
'11': >-
  Bearing abundant fragrance mingled with the dust of honey-laden blossoms, the
  pleasant breeze blew, increasing Rāvaṇa’s desire and delight.
'12': >-
  By reason of the melody of song, the abundance of flowers, the coolness of the
  breeze, the qualities of that mountain, the setting-in of night, and the
  rising of the moon,
'13': >-
  Rāvaṇa of great prowess came under the dominion of Kāma; and, sighing again
  and again, he gazed upon the moon.
'14': >-
  In the meantime, there appeared the foremost of all Apsarases, Rambhā—adorned
  with divine ornaments and decorated with heavenly flowers.
'15': >-
  Her limbs were anointed with celestial sandal; her hair was dressed with
  mandāra blossoms; she had begun her divine festal adornment; her face was like
  the full moon.
'16': >-
  She bore a full and charming waist, adorned with a girdle and strings of
  ornaments, and carried her hips—an excellent gift of Love itself—
'17': >-
  with the special moist cosmetic decorations and with flowers produced in all
  the six seasons.
'18': >-
  She appeared surpassing in beauty, lustre, radiance, and modest grace; and,
  wrapping herself in a blue garment like a rain-cloud heavy with water,
'19': >-
  she went through the midst of the army, her face like the moon, her auspicious
  brows like bows, her thighs like the trunk of an elephant, her hands tender as
  fresh shoots—while Rāvaṇa watched her.
'20': >-
  As she rose and proceeded on, Rāvaṇa, fallen under the power of Love’s arrows,
  seized her hand; and smiling, addressed her as she stood bashful.
'21': >-
  “Where goest thou, fair-hipped one? What attainment seekest thou of thine own
  accord? For whom is this the hour of prosperity—he who shall enjoy thee?”
'22': >-
  “Who today will attain satisfaction from the nectar-like essence of thy
  face—fragrant as lotus and water-lily, like the flavour of ambrosia?”
'23': >-
  “Thy two breasts, timid one—full, auspicious, like golden jars, close-set—unto
  whose chest wilt thou grant their touch?”
'24': >-
  “Thy broad hips, resembling a golden discus and adorned with golden
  girdles—who today shall mount them, O one of heavenly form?”
'25': >-
  “Who among men is my superior today—Śakra, or Viṣṇu, or the twin Aśvins? To
  pass me by and go to another, timid one, befits thee not.”
'26': “Rest thou, broad-hipped lady; this stone-surface is auspicious.”
'27': “In the three worlds there is none other lord equal to me.”
'28': >-
  “Thus, with folded hands and in humble reverence, Daśānana entreats thee:
  choose me—lord over lords, ordainer, and master of the three worlds.”
'29': >-
  Thus addressed, Rambhā, trembling and with joined palms, replied: “Be
  gracious; thou oughtest not to speak such words—for thou art to me as a guru.”
'30': >-
  “For if I should suffer violation at thy hands, I must be protected by thee
  above all others. In righteousness I am thy daughter-in-law; this truth I
  declare to thee.”
'31': >-
  Then Daśagrīva spoke to her as she stood with face bowed down to his feet, her
  hair standing on end, overcome at the very sight of him.
'32': >-
  “If thou art the wife of my son, then indeed thou wouldst be my
  daughter-in-law.” Thus Rambhā answered Rāvaṇa in reply: “So be it.”
'33': >-
  “In righteousness I am the wife of thy son, O bull among Rākṣasas. Thy brother
  Vaiśravaṇa’s son, dearer than life-breath, famed in the three worlds, is he—by
  name Nalakūbara.”
'34': >-
  “Righteousness makes one a brāhmaṇa; valour makes one a kṣatriya; by anger one
  becomes like fire; and by forbearance one becomes like the earth itself.”
'35': >-
  “I am betrothed to that son of the Lokapāla; and for his sake all this
  adornment of mine has been made.”
'36': “Towards none other does my heart stand disposed.”
'37': “By that truth, O king, O subduer of foes, thou oughtest to release me.”
'38': >-
  “He, the righteous-souled, waits for me with eager hope. Thou shouldst not
  create here an obstacle for thy son; let me go.”
'39': >-
  “Follow the path practised by the good, O foremost of Rākṣasas. Thou art
  worthy of honour by me, and likewise I am to be protected by thee.”
'40': >-
  Thus spoken to, Daśagrīva answered in a manner as though humble: “Thou sayest
  ‘I am thy daughter-in-law’ and speakest of the rule of one wife—this is the
  custom among women with single husbands. This is held to be the everlasting
  condition among the gods in heaven.”
'41': “The Apsarases have no husband, nor is there the keeping to one wife.”
'42': >-
  Having spoken thus, that Rākṣasa, placing her upon the stone-surface, intent
  upon the enjoyment of desire, began to force her to union.
'43': >-
  Then Rambhā, released (from his grasp), her garlands and ornaments disordered,
  became distraught—like a river churned by the sport of a great elephant.
'44': >-
  Her hair dishevelled, her tender hands trembling, she was like a flower-laden
  creeper shaken and tossed by the wind.
'45': >-
  Trembling, ashamed, and afraid, with palms joined, she came to Nalakūbara and
  fell at his feet.
'46': >-
  Seeing her in that condition, the great-souled Nalakūbara said: “What is this,
  dear lady, that thou hast fallen at my feet?”
'47': >-
  Then she, heaving sighs and trembling, with folded hands, began to relate to
  him everything, according to the truth of what had happened.
'48': >-
  “This Daśagrīva, O lord, came while journeying to Triviṣṭapa (heaven); with
  the aid of his army he has made this night disastrous for me.”
'49': >-
  “As I was coming to thee, O subduer of foes, he saw me; he seized me and asked
  me, ‘Whose art thou?’—that Rākṣasa.”
'50': >-
  “And I told him all that was true, recounting everything; but his mind,
  overcome by desire and delusion, did not heed my words.”
'51': >-
  “Though I besought him, saying, ‘I am thy daughter-in-law, O lord,’ he cast
  all that behind him and violated me by force.”
'52': >-
  “Thus, O thou of excellent vows, thou shouldst forgive my offence; for, gentle
  sir, the strength of a woman is not equal to that of a man.”
'53': >-
  Hearing this, the son of Vaiśravaṇa, enraged, and hearing of that grievous
  violation, entered into deep contemplation.
'54': >-
  Knowing that deed, the son of Vaiśravaṇa, his eyes reddened with wrath, after
  a moment took water in his hand.
'55': >-
  Taking the water, and having sipped it according to rule, he then uttered a
  dreadful curse against the lord of Rākṣasas.
'56': >-
  “Because, good lady, thou wast violated by him by force against thy will,
  therefore he shall never approach another young woman who is unwilling.”
'57': >-
  “Whenever, tormented by lust, he shall violate a woman who is unwilling, then
  shall his head be shattered into seven pieces.”
'58': >-
  When that curse had been pronounced, blazing like fire, celestial kettle-drums
  resounded; a rain of flowers fell from the sky; and all the gods, with Brahmā
  at their head, rejoiced.
'59': >-
  Knowing the entire course of the world and the death that would befall that
  Rākṣasa, the Ṛṣis and the Pitṛs also attained unsurpassed gladness.
'60': >-
  But when Daśagrīva heard that hair-raising curse, he no longer approved of
  engaging in sexual union with unwilling women.
'61': >-
  By this, all women devoted to their husbands attained gladness, having heard
  the pleasing curse pronounced by Nalakūbara.
'62': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-sixth sarga, called “The Curse of Nalakūbara,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
