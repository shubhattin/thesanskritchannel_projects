  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa,
  begins the thirty-ninth sarga, called “The Beholding of Laṅkā” (6.39).
'1': >-
  Having spent that night there upon Suvela, those heroic leaders of the
  monkey-host beheld Laṅkā—its forests and its pleasure-groves as well.
'2': >-
  They saw them as even and gracious, enchanting, vast and long-stretching; and
  beholding those sights delightful to the eye, they became filled with wonder.
'3': >-
  Crowded with campaka, aśoka, bakula, śāla and tāla trees; covered with
  thickets of tamāla; and wreathed about with nāga-mālā creepers,
'4': >-
  And everywhere adorned with hiṃtāla palms, arjuna trees, nīpa trees, and fully
  blossomed saptaparṇa; with tilaka, karṇikāra, and pāṭala trees on every side,
'5': >-
  Laṅkā shone forth with trees whose tips were in bloom and which were
  enwreathed with creepers—by manifold divine growths—like Indra’s Amarāvatī.
'6': >-
  With wondrous flowers, with soft and tender reddish shoots, with green swards
  and dark-blue (shaded) stretches, with variegated rows of woodland,
'7': >-
  There the trees bore exceedingly fragrant and most delightful blossoms, and
  fruits as well—like ornaments worn by men.
'8': >-
  That forest—resembling Caitraratha, charming, comparable to Nandana—delightful
  in every season, shone forth, filled with swarms of bees.
'9': >-
  There was heard, by the forest-cascades, the sound of dancing dātyūha birds,
  koyaṣṭi-baka birds, and peacocks, and also the song of cuckoos.
'10': >-
  There were birds ever intoxicated (with joy), and places frequented by bees;
  groves crowded with kokilas, and resounding with the cries of many kinds of
  birds.
'11': >-
  There were songs as though sung by bhṛṅgarāja birds, and the calls of kuraras;
  loud clamors of koṇāla birds, and cries of sārasas. Then they entered those
  forests and pleasure-groves.
'12': >-
  Those heroes—the monkeys, able to assume forms at will—were delighted and
  rejoiced as those mighty and vigorous vānaras proceeded within.
'13': >-
  A breeze, pleasing to the nostrils, blew, fragrant from contact with blossoms.
  But other leaders of monkey-heroes, coming forth from their troops and
  permitted by Sugrīva, went to Laṅkā adorned with banners.
'14': >-
  Startling the birds, wearying the deer and elephants, and making that Laṅkā
  tremble with their own roars—those foremost of those who shout (in battle)
  moved about.
'15': >-
  Of great speed, they made the earth pressed down beneath their feet; and dust,
  raised by their footfalls, at once went upward.
'16': >-
  Bears, lions, buffaloes, elephants, deer, and birds—terrified by that
  sound—departed in fear to the ten directions.
'17': >-
  And one lofty peak of Trikūṭa, towering and touching the heavens, was on every
  side covered with flowers, and shone like great silver.
'18': >-
  Spreading a hundred yojanas, spotless and fair to behold—smooth, splendid, and
  vast—hard to approach even for birds,
'19': >-
  Hard to ascend even by the mind—how much more by men through physical effort!
  Upon that peak was situated Laṅkā, protected by Rāvaṇa.
'20': >-
  That city was ten yojanas in breadth and twenty yojanas in length; with lofty
  gateways like pale clouds, it shone with houses of gold and with silver as
  well.
'21': >-
  With mansions and aerial cars (vimānas), Laṅkā was exceedingly adorned—like a
  dense mass of clouds giving shade, like the middle station (abode) of Viṣṇu.
'22': >-
  In it was seen a palace adorned with a thousand pillars, shaped like the peak
  of Kailāsa, as though it were scratching the very sky.
'23': >-
  That shrine (caitya) of the lord of rākṣasas became an ornament of the
  city—ever guarded, in full measure, by a hundred rākṣasas.
'24': >-
  Charming, rich with gold, beautified by mountains, and beautified by
  pleasure-gardens, varied with many minerals,
'25': >-
  Resounding with assemblies of diverse birds, frequented by various kinds of
  deer, abounding in many sorts of blossoms, and attended by many rākṣasas,
'26': >-
  Rāma—the elder brother of Lakṣmaṇa, possessed of fortune—beheld that
  prosperous city of Rāvaṇa, rich in prosperity, together with the vānaras.
'27': >-
  Seeing that city, densely crowded with great houses, resembling heaven, the
  valorous elder brother of Lakṣmaṇa attained astonishment.
'28': >-
  Rāma, with his great army, beheld that city—filled with jewels, of many
  arrangements, adorned with rows of mansions—having mighty, machine-fastened
  gates as its chief entrances.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-ninth sarga, called “The Beholding of Laṅkā,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the original epic (6.39).
