  Now begins the one-hundredth chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Succession of Weapons between Rāma and Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Beholding Mahodara and Mahāpārśva slain, and that mighty hero Virūpākṣa as
  well—when he had been struck down—Rāvaṇa (thus) saw them fallen.
'2': >-
  Then, in that great battle, a vast wrath entered Rāvaṇa. He urged on his
  charioteer and spoke these words:
'3': >-
  “For my ministers who have been slain, and for my city that is hemmed in, I
  shall dispel my grief only by killing those two—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.”
'4': >-
  “In battle I shall hew down the tree that is Rāma, the giver of Sītā as flower
  and fruit—whose great branches are Sugrīva, Jāmbavān, Kumuda, and Nala,”
'5': >-
  “and also Dvivida and Mainda, Aṅgada and Gandhamādana, Hanumān and Suṣeṇa, and
  all the leaders of the monkey hosts.”
'6': >-
  That great chariot-warrior, making the ten quarters resound with the thunder
  of his chariot, sped swiftly forth and rushed at Rāghava.
'7': >-
  By that sound, the rivers, mountains, and forests were filled; the whole earth
  shook, while lions, beasts, and birds were terrified.
'8': >-
  He employed a weapon—dark, exceedingly dreadful, most cruel—which burned up
  all the monkeys; and they fell on every side.
'9': >-
  Dust sprang up upon the earth as they, broken and fleeing in confusion, ran;
  for they could not endure that (weapon), fashioned by Brahmā himself.
'10': >-
  Seeing hundreds of troops shattered by Rāvaṇa’s most excellent arrows, Rāghava
  stood his ground, firm and composed.
'11': >-
  Then the tiger among rākṣasas, having routed the monkey army, beheld Rāma
  standing there, unconquered.
'12': >-
  With his brother Lakṣmaṇa at his side—like Vāsava with Viṣṇu—he seemed to be
  drawing lines upon the sky, supporting and bending a mighty bow.
'13': >-
  Lotus-petal-wide-eyed, long-armed, the subduer of foes—thus the greatly
  radiant Rāma, powerful, with Saumitrī beside him,
'14': >-
  seeing the monkeys broken in battle and Rāvaṇa rushing on, rejoiced and,
  standing in the midst, took up his bow.
'15': >-
  Then he began to brace and stretch that supreme bow—of great speed and great
  sound—seeming as though it would cleave the very earth.
'16': >-
  And by the volleys of Rāvaṇa’s arrows, and by the sound of Rāma’s bow being
  drawn, many rākṣasas fell by hundreds then.
'17': >-
  Approaching the track of arrows of those two princes, Rāvaṇa shone like Rāhu
  near the moon and the sun.
'18': >-
  Desiring to fight first, Lakṣmaṇa, drawing his bow, loosed sharp arrows like
  tongues of fire.
'19': >-
  Those arrows, released into the sky by Lakṣmaṇa the archer, Rāvaṇa of great
  splendor warded off with arrows of his own.
'20': >-
  With one arrow (he cut) one; with three, three; with ten, ten—thus he severed
  Lakṣmaṇa’s shafts, displaying the swiftness of his hand.
'21': >-
  Passing beyond Saumitrī, Rāvaṇa, the conqueror in battle, came upon Rāma in
  the fight, standing like another mountain.
'22': >-
  Having reached Rāghava, eyes reddened with rage, Rāvaṇa, lord of rākṣasas,
  poured forth showers of arrows.
'23': >-
  When Rāma saw the streams of arrows from Rāvaṇa fall away from his bow, he
  quickly seized sharp bhalla-shafts without delay.
'24': >-
  Then Rāghava cut down those masses of arrows with keen bhallas—blazing,
  exceedingly dreadful, like venomous serpents.
'25': >-
  Rāghava rained upon Rāvaṇa, and Rāvaṇa upon Rāghava likewise—each upon the
  other—diverse showers of sharp arrows.
'26': >-
  For a long time they moved in a wondrous circle, to left and right, lifting
  and striking at one another with the force of their arrows—both unconquered.
'27': >-
  As they fought together, beings were terrified—those two, fierce, discharging
  shafts, like Yama and Antaka in appearance.
'28': >-
  Then the sky became continually filled with various arrows, like masses of
  clouds at the setting of the sun, crowded with garlands of lightning.
'29': >-
  By the rain of arrows—swift, with exceedingly sharp points, fletched with
  vulture-feathers, well-feathered and keen—the sky appeared as though latticed
  with windows.
'30': >-
  Then they made the sky a darkness of arrows, like two great clouds risen even
  when the sun had gone to its setting.
'31': >-
  Between those two, longing for each other’s death, there arose a great
  battle—unapproachable, unthinkable—like that between Vṛtra and Vāsava.
'32': >-
  For both were supreme archers; both were skilled in war; both were foremost
  among those who know weapons; both moved about in battle.
'33': >-
  Wherever either went, there too surged waves of arrows—like waves in two
  oceans driven by the wind.
'34': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa, the terror of the worlds, with hands closely engaged, launched a
  garland of iron shafts (nārācas) at Rāma’s forehead.
'35': >-
  That (garland), shot from the fierce bow, gleaming like the petal of a blue
  lotus, Rāma bore upon his head, and he did not fall into distress.
'36': >-
  Then Rāma—reciting mantras, invoking the Rudra-weapon, and taking up arrows
  again—was filled with wrath.
'37': >-
  That mighty, greatly radiant hero, drawing his bow, released and hurled those
  arrows at the lord of rākṣasas, sending a rain of shafts.
'38': >-
  Those arrows fell upon the armor of the rākṣasa-king, like a great cloud; and
  upon that invulnerable lord of rākṣasas they did not then produce pain.
'39': >-
  Then again Rāma, skilled in every weapon, struck at that rākṣasa ruler seated
  in his chariot—at his forehead—with a supreme missile.
'40': >-
  Those (missiles), assuming the form of arrows like five-headed serpents,
  hissing, entered the earth—having been countered by Rāvaṇa.
'41': >-
  Having destroyed Rāghava’s weapon, Rāvaṇa, overwhelmed by wrath, brought forth
  a very dreadful Asura-weapon.
'42': >-
  He sent forth arrows with the faces of lions and tigers, with the faces of
  herons and wolves,
'43': >-
  with the faces of vultures and hawks, and likewise with jackal faces; with
  gaping mouths, fearsome; with five faces, lolling their tongues—he discharged
  sharp arrows.
'44': >-
  And other arrows too—with the faces of asses, with boar-faces; with the mouths
  of dogs and cocks; with the faces of makaras and venomous serpents—
'45': >-
  these and many others, fashioned by illusion, the mighty one released—against
  Rāma—angry, hissing like a serpent.
'46': >-
  Thus assailed by the Asura-weapon, the bull among the Raghu line, blazing like
  fire, sent forth with great vigor a Fire-weapon, resembling fire itself.
'47': >-
  There he discharged arrows with mouths blazing like fire, and others with the
  face of the sun; with the face of the moon and the half-moon; with the face of
  a comet; bearing the hues of planets and stars; having the countenance of
  mighty meteors.
'48': >-
  And he also released various arrows resembling lightning-tongues. Those
  dreadful arrows of Rāvaṇa, struck by Rāghava’s weapon,
'49': >-
  met their dissolution in the sky, and (many) were smitten down by thousands.
  Seeing that weapon destroyed by Rāma of unwearied deeds,
'50': >-
  all the monkeys of wishful form rejoiced and roared, those heroic ones facing
  Sugrīva, surrounding Rāghava on every side.
'51': >-
  Then Rāghava, having forcefully destroyed that weapon which had issued from
  Rāvaṇa’s arms, the great-souled son of Daśaratha became joyful; and the lords
  of monkeys, delighted, roared aloud.
'52': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundredth chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the holy, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first poet—named “The Succession of Weapons
  between Rāma and Rāvaṇa.”
