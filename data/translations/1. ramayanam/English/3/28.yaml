  Now begins, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the
  twenty-eighth canto, named “The Combat between Khara and Rāma.”
'1': >-
  Seeing Dūṣaṇa slain in battle together with Triśiras, even Khara was seized
  with fear, beholding the prowess of Rāma.
'2': >-
  For he saw the army of rākṣasas—unendurable and of mighty strength—laid low by
  Rāma alone; and Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras as well were slain.
'3': >-
  Beholding that host, for the most part destroyed, the rākṣasa, downcast at
  heart, rushed upon Rāma—like Namuci advancing upon Vāsava (Indra).
'4': >-
  Drawing forth his powerful bow, Khara hurled at Rāma barbed arrows,
  blood-drinking, like wrathful venomous serpents.
'5': >-
  Shaking his bowstring again and again, displaying the weapons by his practiced
  skill, Khara, mounted on his chariot, ranged about the battle-field, sending
  forth shafts.
'6': >-
  That great charioteer filled all the directions and the intermediate quarters
  with arrows; seeing him, Rāma too took up his exceedingly mighty bow.
'7': >-
  With terrible arrows, like sparks from fires, he made the sky as though
  without a gap—like a rain-cloud with its showers.
'8': >-
  Then, by the sharp arrows discharged by Khara and by Rāma, the very firmament
  seemed no firmament, on every side thickly crowded with shafts.
'9': >-
  The sun, covered over with a net of arrows, did not then shine forth, such was
  the mutual fury for each other’s slaughter as the two fought on.
'10': >-
  Then with long-shafted arrows, with razor-sharp points, and with broad-headed
  shafts, he struck Rāma in battle, as with goads one strikes a mighty elephant.
'11': >-
  All beings beheld that rākṣasa, standing poised upon his chariot, bow in hand,
  like Death himself holding a noose in his hand.
'12': >-
  Khara then deemed Rāma—who had stood forth in manly prowess as the slayer of
  the entire host—to be wearied, though of great spirit.
'13': >-
  Though he saw him lion-like in valor, moving with the lion’s stride, Rāma was
  not perturbed—like a lion at a petty deer.
'14': >-
  Then Khara, with a great chariot resplendent like the sun, drew near to
  Rāma—like a moth rushing into the fire.
'15': >-
  Then Khara cut off Rāma’s bow—together with the arrow upon it—at the very grip
  of that high-souled one, displaying his dexterity of hand.
'16': >-
  But again, taking up seven other arrows, shining like the thunderbolt of
  Śakra, Rāma, enraged, struck him in the vital spots in battle.
'17': >-
  Then, assailing Rāma of incomparable might with a thousand arrows, Khara
  roared aloud with a great cry in the fight.
'18': >-
  Thereupon, smitten by the arrows discharged by Khara—well-jointed,
  strong-shafted—Rāma’s corselet, radiant like the sun, fell upon the ground.
'19': >-
  Then Rāghava, his whole body beset with arrows, enraged, shone in battle—Rāma
  blazing like smokeless fire.
'20': >-
  Thereupon Rāma, crusher of foes, made a deep thunderous sound, and, for the
  destruction of that enemy, he strung another great bow.
'21': >-
  Lifting up that exceedingly great, excellent Vaiṣṇava bow—released to him by
  the great ṛṣi—he rushed straight at Khara.
'22': >-
  Then, with arrows having golden feathers and slightly bent joints, Rāma,
  greatly enraged, cut down Khara’s banner in the battle.
'23': >-
  That beautiful golden standard, severed in many ways, fell to the earth, as
  though the sun had descended by the command of the gods.
'24': >-
  Khara, enraged, pierced Rāma in his limbs with four arrows—knowing the vital
  parts—like one striking an elephant with javelins.
'25': >-
  Rāma, pierced by many arrows shot from Khara’s bow, his body drenched in
  blood, became exceedingly wrathful.
'26': >-
  Then Rāma—the best of bowmen, the supreme archer—grasping his bow in that
  great combat, released six well-aimed arrows, marked for their targets.
'27': >-
  With one arrow he struck the head; with two he struck the two arms; and with
  three, crescent-faced, he struck the chest.
'28': >-
  Thereafter the mighty and radiant one, enraged, smote the rākṣasa with
  thirteen iron-pointed nārācas, blazing like the sun.
'29': >-
  With one he struck the yoke of the chariot; with four he struck the speckled
  horses; and with the sixth, in the combat, he cut off the head of Khara’s
  charioteer.
'30': >-
  With three arrows the powerful one broke the three yoke-poles; with two the
  axle; and with the twelfth arrow he severed Khara’s bow together with the
  arrow upon it.
'31': >-
  Having cut it, Rāghava, as though laughing, then with the thunderbolt-like
  thirteenth arrow—equal to Indra—he pierced Khara in battle.
'32': >-
  With his bow shattered, without chariot, his horses slain, his charioteer
  slain, Khara leapt down, mace in hand, and then stood upon the ground.
'33': >-
  When that deed of Rāma, the great charioteer, had come to pass, the gods and
  the great ṛṣis—gathered together at the forefront of their aerial
  cars—joyfully honored him with joined palms.
'34': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-eighth canto in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, named “The Combat between Khara and Rāma.”
