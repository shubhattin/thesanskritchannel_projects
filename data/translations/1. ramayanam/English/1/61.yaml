  Now begins the sixty-first canto in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, renowned as “The Sale of Śunaḥśepa.”
'1': >-
  Beholding those sages who were setting forth, the mighty and splendid
  Viśvāmitra spoke to Rāma, the tiger among men, and to all those
  forest-dwelling ascetics:
'2': >-
  “A great obstruction has arisen here, occupying the southern quarter. Let us
  proceed to another direction, and there we shall practise austerities.”
'3': >-
  “In the vast western region, at Puṣkara, O great-souled ones, we shall perform
  our penance in comfort; for that is indeed a pleasant forest of austerity.”
'4': >-
  Having thus spoken, that great and radiant sage went to Puṣkara and, living on
  roots and fruits, performed fierce and unassailable austerities.
'5': >-
  At that very time, the mighty lord of Ayodhyā, famed by the name Ambarīṣa, set
  about to perform a sacrifice.
'6': >-
  While he was conducting the rite, Indra carried away the sacrificial animal.
  And when the beast had disappeared, the officiating priest said this to the
  king:
'7': >-
  “The victim that was brought, O King, has vanished through your misrule.
  Faults strike down an unguarding king, O lord of men.”
'8': >-
  “This calls for a great expiation, O best of men: quickly procure either a man
  (as substitute) or an animal, while the sacrificial procedure is still in
  progress.”
'9': >-
  Hearing the preceptor’s words, that king—best of men, of great
  understanding—went in search of an animal, offering thousands of cows (in
  exchange).
'10': >-
  Searching through many regions and provinces—cities, forests, and also holy
  hermitages—the lord of the earth continued his quest.
'11': >-
  Then, O beloved one, O joy of the Raghus, he beheld Ṛcīka seated upon
  Bhṛgutunga, together with his sons and his wife.
'12': >-
  That kingly seer of boundless splendour, after bowing down and duly
  propitiating him, addressed the great sage Ṛcīka, blazing with the power of
  austerity:
'13': >-
  After inquiring of Ṛcīka’s welfare in every respect, he spoke these words:
  “Will you sell your son for a hundred thousand cows?”
'14': >-
  “For the sake of the sacrificial animal, O greatly fortunate one, O Bhārgava,
  I should deem myself successful; I have searched all lands, yet I do not
  obtain a victim fit for the sacrifice.”
'15': >-
  “Therefore you ought, for a price, to give me one of your sons.” Thus
  addressed, the great and radiant Ṛcīka replied:
'16': >-
  “I would never, O best of men, sell my eldest son in any manner whatsoever.”
  Hearing Ṛcīka’s words, the mother of those noble-souled sons then spoke,
'17': >-
  addressing Ambarīṣa, the tiger among men: “The venerable Bhārgava has said
  that the eldest son is not to be sold.”
'18': >-
  “Know also, O lord, that my youngest—Śunaka—is dear to me. Therefore, O king,
  I will not give you the younger son.”
'19': >-
  “For generally, O best of men, the eldest are beloved of their fathers; and
  the younger are dear to mothers—therefore I shall protect the youngest.”
'20': >-
  When the sage had thus spoken, and likewise the sage’s wife, Śunaḥśepa
  himself, O Rāma—the middle son—spoke these words:
'21': >-
  “My father declares the eldest not for sale, and my mother speaks for the
  youngest. I consider the middle one to be for sale; O prince, take me away.”
'22': >-
  Then the king, O mighty-armed one, at the conclusion of that discourse with
  the knower of Brahman, gave heaps of treasure—crores of gold and pure bullion,
  and masses of gems—
'23': >-
  and with a hundred thousand cows the lord of men took Śunaḥśepa and,
  exceedingly delighted, departed, O delight of the Raghus.
'24': >-
  That royal sage Ambarīṣa, that great and glorious one, swiftly placed
  Śunaḥśepa upon a chariot and hastened away at once.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-first canto in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the primeval epic, entitled “The Sale of Śunaḥśepa.”
