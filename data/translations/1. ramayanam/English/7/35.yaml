  Now begins the thirty-fifth chapter of the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Birth and Origin of Hanūmān.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, with palms joined and endowed with humility, questioned that sage
  who dwelt in the southern hermitage, and spoke these words, full of meaning:
'2': >-
  “Indeed the might of Vāli and of Rāvaṇa is incomparable; yet my conviction is
  that neither of them equals Hanūmān.”
'3': >-
  “Valour, skill, strength, steadfastness, wisdom, the means of right policy,
  heroism, and majesty of power—these have all taken up their abode in Hanūmān.”
'4': >-
  “Seeing the ocean itself and beholding the monkey-host sinking into
  despondency, that mighty-armed one reassured them and, by a single leap,
  crossed a hundred yojanas.”
'5': >-
  “Having then stormed the city of Laṅkā and penetrated Rāvaṇa’s inner
  apartments, he saw Sītā; he spoke with her, and in that manner he comforted
  her as well.”
'6': >-
  “Leaders of the army, sons of ministers, attendants and servants, and even
  Rāvaṇa’s son—these all were struck down there by Hanūmān alone.”
'7': >-
  “And again, freed from bondage, after speaking to the Ten-necked one, he
  reduced Laṅkā to ashes—like the earth set ablaze by fire.”
'8': >-
  “Such deeds as are heard of in Hanūmān’s battles are not heard of even of
  Time, nor of Śakra, nor of Viṣṇu, nor of Kubera, the Lord of Wealth.”
'9': >-
  “By the heroism of his arms, Laṅkā was reached, Sītā was found, Lakṣmaṇa was
  preserved, and by him I obtained victory, the kingdom, friends, and kinsmen.”
'10': >-
  “If Hanūmān, the friend of the lord of monkeys, had not been ours, who would
  have been able even to learn the tidings of Jānakī?”
'11': >-
  “For what reason, when enmity arose then through Vāli’s deed—when Sugrīva’s
  desire was to regain what was dear—was Vāli not burned up like a dry creeper?”
'12': >-
  “I think Hanūmān did not know his own strength, since, seeing the monkey-lord
  distressed and intent on preserving his very life, he remained as he was.”
'13': >-
  “All this, O Blessed One, concerning the great-minded Hanūmān—tell it to me in
  detail, truly as it was, O you who are honoured even by the gods.”
'14': >-
  Hearing Rāghava’s words, well supported by reason, the sage then spoke these
  words in Hanūmān’s presence:
'15': >-
  “True indeed, O best of the Raghu line, is what you say about Hanūmān: in
  strength he has no equal, in speed none superior, and in intelligence none
  beyond him.”
'16': >-
  “Yet formerly he was cursed by sages with unfailing curses, and a boon was
  granted him—that though he was mighty and a crusher of foes, he would not know
  his own strength.”
'17': >-
  “O Rāma of great might, even what he did in his very childhood cannot be fully
  described—so extraordinary were his deeds, owing to his childish state.”
'18': >-
  “But if it is your wish to hear it, O Rāghava, then, steadying my mind, O
  Rāma, listen as I relate it.”
'19': >-
  “There is a mountain named Sumeru, golden with splendour like gold bestowed by
  the Sun; there, his father, named Keśarī, ruled his kingdom.”
'20': >-
  “His wife was she who is renowned by the name Añjanā; upon her, indeed, Vāyu
  begot that excellent son.”
'21': >-
  “Then Añjanā gave birth to him, radiant like ripened grains; and wishing to
  gather fruits, she went forth to roam in the dense forest.”
'22': >-
  “Separated from his mother and sorely tormented by hunger, the infant cried
  exceedingly—like a baby in a thicket of reeds.”
'23': >-
  “Then he saw the rising Sun, like a heap of hibiscus blossoms; and, from
  desire for fruit, he sprang up toward the Sun.”
'24': >-
  “The child, facing the young Sun, as though himself a embodied young Sun,
  leapt through the midst of the sky, wishing to seize that young Sun.”
'25': >-
  “As Hanūmān, still in infanthood, was thus leaping, a very great wonder arose
  among gods, Dānavas, and Yakṣas.”
'26': >-
  “Neither the Wind himself is so swift, nor Garuḍa, nor even the mind—such is
  this son of Vāyu as he traverses the excellent mid-sky.”
'27': >-
  “If, while still a child, he has such speed and prowess in movement, then,
  attaining youth and strength, what force of momentum will he have?”
'28': >-
  “The Wind followed his leaping son, and, fearing the Sun’s burning heat,
  protected him—cool like a mass of frost.”
'29': >-
  “He traversed many thousands of yojanas and moved through the sky; by his
  father’s power and by the impetuosity of childhood he drew near to the Sun.”
'30': >-
  “Thinking, ‘This is a child, unaware of fault,’ the maker of day did not burn
  him—for a task was impending there.”
'31': >-
  “On that very day when he leapt to seize the Sun, on that very day Rāhu sought
  to seize the maker of day.”
'32': >-
  “Touched by him upon the Sun’s chariot, O Rāma, Rāhu—crusher of Moon and
  Sun—drew back in fear and fled.”
'33': >-
  “Then the son of Siṃhikā, enraged, went to Indra’s abode, and, knitting his
  brows, spoke to the god who was surrounded by the hosts of gods:”},{
'34': >-
  “O Vāsava, you granted me the removal of hunger in the form of the Moon and
  the Sun. Why, O slayer of Vṛtra, have you given that boon to another, to one
  else of power?”
'35': >-
  “Today, at the appointed time, I approached the Sun, wishing to seize him; but
  then another, encountering him—another Rāhu, as it were—suddenly seized the
  Sun!”
'36': >-
  “Hearing Rāhu’s words, Vāsava, filled with agitation, sprang up leaving his
  seat, the golden garland upon him swinging.”
'37': >-
  “Then—mountain-peaked like Kailāsa, four-tusked, with ichor flowing,
  splendidly adorned, tall, and with golden bells that rang like laughter—”
'38': >-
  “Indra mounted that lordly elephant, Airāvata, set Rāhu before him as guide,
  and went to where the Sun was, together with this Hanūmān.”
'39': >-
  “Then, in great haste, Rāhu, abandoning Vāsava, rushed forward; and he was
  seen by Hanūmān running like a mountain-peak.”
'40': >-
  “Thereupon, letting go of the Sun and looking upon Rāhu as the fruit, he
  sprang again through the sky, in order to seize the son of Siṃhikā.”
'41': >-
  “Casting off the Sun, O Rāma, and seeing the monkey rushing on, Rāhu turned
  back; his face remained behind, and he fled with his visage turned away.”
'42': >-
  “Hoping for Indra as protector, the son of Siṃhikā, from terror, cried out
  again and again, ‘Indra! Indra!’”
'43': >-
  “Hearing the cry of the wailing Rāhu—whose voice had already been
  recognized—Indra said, ‘Fear not; I shall slay him.’”
'44': >-
  “But Māruti, seeing Airāvata and thinking, ‘This indeed is a great fruit,’ ran
  toward the king of elephants.”
'45': >-
  “As he ran, desiring to seize Airāvata, his form for a moment became dreadful
  and radiant—like that of Indra and Agni in brilliance.”
'46': >-
  “Seeing him thus charging, Śacī’s lord, not exceedingly wrathful, struck him
  with the thunderbolt, hurled from his hand.”
'47': >-
  “Then he fell upon a mountain, struck by Indra’s thunderbolt; and as he fell,
  his left jaw was broken.”
'48': >-
  “When that child had fallen, tormented by the blow of the thunderbolt, Pavana
  grew angry with Indra—for the harm of creatures.”
'49': >-
  “Gathering up his course, that lord entered among the beings; taking his own
  infant son, Māruta entered a cave.”
'50': >-
  “Covering up the passages of feces and urine, and causing extreme affliction
  to all creatures, he restrained all beings—like Vāsava restraining the rains.”
'51': >-
  “Because of the Wind’s wrath, beings everywhere became without breath; their
  joints were splitting, and they became as though they were pieces of wood.”
'52': >-
  “Through the Wind’s wrath, the three worlds became devoid of Vedic study and
  of vaṣaṭ-cries, without activity, bereft of dharma—like a place fallen into
  hell.”
'53': >-
  “Then the creatures, together with Gandharvas—with gods, Asuras, and
  humans—afflicted and desiring well-being, approached Prajāpati.”
'54': >-
  “With palms joined, the gods—whose bellies were like great pots—said: ‘By you,
  O Blessed Lord, were created the fourfold beings, O lord of creatures.’”
'55': >-
  “‘By you this lord of the winds was bestowed on us as the giver of life;
  becoming the lord of our breath, why does he now restrain it today, O best of
  beings?’”
'56': >-
  “‘Creating sorrow, he has held it back as if women within an inner chamber;
  therefore we, struck down by the Wind, have come to you for refuge.’”
'57': >-
  “Hearing this of the creatures, Prajāpati, lord of creatures, said, ‘It is due
  to a cause,’ and then spoke again to the beings:”},{
'58': >-
  “‘For what cause the Wind grew angry and held back the breath—hear all that.
  It is fit for you to hear, and fitting for yourselves to know.’”
'59': >-
  “‘His son has today been struck down by Indra, the lord of the immortals.
  Taking to heart Rāhu’s words, Anila then became enraged.’”
'60': >-
  “‘Bodiless though he is, the Wind moves within bodies, sustaining them; for
  without the Wind, a body becomes equal to mere pieces of wood.’”
'61': >-
  “‘Wind is the very breath; Wind is happiness; Wind is this entire universe.
  Abandoned by the Wind, the world finds no happiness.’”
'62': >-
  “‘Today indeed the world’s life has been abandoned by the Wind; today indeed
  you stand without breath, like walls of wood.’”
'63': >-
  “‘Therefore let us go to where Māruta is, he who bestows radiance upon us; let
  us not go to destruction without first winning the favour of Aditi’s sons (the
  gods).’”
'64': >-
  “Then Prajāpati, accompanied by the creatures, together with gods, Gandharvas,
  serpents, Guhyakas, and Bhujagas, went to the place where Māruta sat, holding
  his son who had been struck by the lord of gods.”
'65': >-
  “Then the four-faced Lord (Brahmā), beholding that son—radiant like the Sun,
  like Vaiśvānara-fire, and like gold—lying in the lap of ever-swift Māruta, was
  moved with compassion, along with the gods, Gandharvas, Ṛṣis, Yakṣas, and
  Rākṣasas.”},{
'66': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fifth chapter of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first poet, called “The Birth and
  Origin of Hanūmān.”
