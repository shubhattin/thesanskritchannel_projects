  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-fourth canto, named “The Close Approach of Khara’s Army to Rāma.”
'1': >-
  But when Khara, of Khara-like prowess, had returned to his encampment, Rāma,
  together with his brother, beheld those very ominous portents.
'2': >-
  Rāma, exceedingly intolerant of wrong, seeing those most dreadful portents and
  perceiving them to bode ill for living beings, spoke these words to Lakṣmaṇa.
'3': >-
  “Behold these, O mighty-armed one—these great and risen portents that ravage
  all creatures—foretelling the destruction of all the rākṣasas.
'4': >-
  “See—blood-red streams are being poured forth with harsh sounds; in the sky
  the clouds withdraw, grim, with the hue of an ass.
'5': >-
  “All my arrows, formerly dear to me in battle, appear as though smoky; and my
  bows with golden backs, O discerning one, twitch and quiver.
'6': >-
  “The way in which the birds that roam this forest are crying here—before us
  there is no fearlessness to be had; and there is doubt even regarding life
  itself.
'7': >-
  “A very great encounter will take place—of this there is no doubt. This arm of
  mine, throbbing again and again, tells me so.
'8': >-
  “At such close quarters, O hero, the victory will be ours and the enemy’s
  defeat; for your face is seen to be bright and serene.
'9': >-
  “For those who rise for battle, O Lakṣmaṇa—when their life is nearing its
  end—their countenance becomes lusterless.
'10': >-
  “This terrible, great uproar is heard—the fierce roaring of the rākṣasas, and
  the sound of kettle-drums being struck by those rākṣasas of cruel deeds.
'11': >-
  “He who seeks what is auspicious—an intelligent man who suspects impending
  calamity—should make due provision beforehand for what is yet to come.
'12': >-
  “Therefore, taking Vaidehī with you, and with arrows in hand, O bearer of the
  bow, take shelter in a mountain-cave—hard to assail and thick with trees.
'13': >-
  “Do not seek to oppose this word of mine. Go, dear one, without delay—(as it
  were) compelled by my feet, as though under a curse.”
'14': >-
  “You are indeed heroic and strong; you would slay them without doubt. Yet I
  myself desire to destroy all these night-roamers with my own hand.”
'15': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, together with Sītā, took up his arrows and
  bow and entered that well-defended cave for refuge.
'16': >-
  When Lakṣmaṇa, along with Sītā, had gone into the cave, Rāma, saying, “Now
  indeed it is set in motion,” donned his coat of mail.
'17': >-
  Adorned with that mail, gleaming like fire, Rāma appeared in the gloom like a
  great flame rising up.
'18': >-
  And the mighty one, lifting his great bow and taking up his arrows, stood
  there, filling the quarters with the twang of his bowstring.
'19': >-
  Then the gods with the Gandharvas, and the Siddhas with the Cāraṇas—those
  great-souled ones—assembled, desiring to behold the battle.
'20': >-
  And great-souled ṛṣis, the foremost of brahmarṣis in the world—those of holy
  deeds—gathered together and spoke among themselves.
'21': >-
  “May there be well-being for cows and brāhmaṇas, and for the worlds!”—thus
  resolved, they said: “May Rāghava be victorious in battle over the Paulastya
  night-roamers.”
'22': >-
  “As the wielder of the discus (Viṣṇu) in battle (conquers) all the foremost of
  the asuras—so (shall he)!” Saying thus, they again spoke, looking at one
  another.
'23': >-
  “Fourteen thousand rākṣasas of dreadful deeds—and Rāma alone,
  righteous-souled: how will this battle come to pass?”
'24': >-
  Thus the royal-sages, the Siddhas, and the hosts of best among
  twice-born—filled with eager curiosity—stood watching; and the deities
  remained stationed in their aerial cars.
'25': >-
  Seeing Rāma, suffused with radiance, standing at the forefront of battle, all
  beings then trembled in fear.
'26': >-
  Peerless was the form of that Rāma, unwearied in action; and the aspect he
  bore then was like that of the great-souled Rudra when enraged.
'27': >-
  While such discourse was going on among the gods, Gandharvas, and Cāraṇas,
  there arose a deep, reverberating din—terrible—with hides for armor, weapons
  and banners.
'28': >-
  The army of the yātudhānas advanced from every side, raising heroic cries and
  moving to meet one another.
'29': >-
  They kept stretching their bows, and repeatedly yawning aloud; their sounds
  rang clear; and they struck their kettle-drums as well.
'30': >-
  A most tumultuous roar of theirs filled that forest; and by that noise the
  wild beasts that dwelt in the woods were terrified.
'31': >-
  They fled to where it was silent, not looking back behind them; and that
  swift, massed host pressed on toward Rāma.
'32': >-
  Bearing various weapons, deep and vast like the ocean, Rāma too—skilled in
  warfare—moved his gaze in every direction, surveying all.
'33': >-
  He beheld that army of Khara, come facing him for battle; and he spread his
  dreadful bow and drew arrows forth from his quivers.
'34': >-
  He gathered within himself a fierce wrath for the slaying of all the rākṣasas;
  and, enraged, he became hard to look upon, blazing like the fire at the end of
  an age.
'35': >-
  Beholding him possessed of such splendor, the deities of the forest were
  shaken with fear. And then the form of wrathful Rāma appeared like that of
  Pinākī (Śiva) poised to destroy Dakṣa’s sacrifice.
'36': >-
  With their bows for ornaments, their chariots, and their cuirasses—shining
  with a hue like fire—the host of flesh-eaters looked like a mass of dark-blue
  clouds at sunrise.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fourth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Close Approach of Khara’s Army to
  Rāma.”
