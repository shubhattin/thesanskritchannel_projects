  Now begins the twenty-second canto of Sundara-kāṇḍa in the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Stipulation of Two Months.”
'1': >-
  Hearing the harsh words spoken by Sītā, the lord of the rākṣasas then replied
  to Sītā—she of lovely appearance—speaking what was displeasing.
'2': >-
  As one seeks more and more to soothe a woman and bring her under control, so
  much the more is one treated with contempt; and as one speaks more and more
  what is agreeable, so much the more is one dishonoured.
'3': >-
  The passion that has arisen for you restrains my wrath—just as a skilful
  charioteer, finding the path of one who is running away, holds in the steeds.
'4': >-
  Crooked indeed is desire in men, in whom it becomes fastened; toward such a
  person, pity arises—and affection too, indeed.
'5': >-
  For this reason I do not slay you, O fair-faced one—though you deserve death,
  deserve contempt, and delight in false renunciation.
'6': >-
  For whatever harsh words you speak to me, for each and every such word, O
  Maithilī, a dreadful death would be fitting for you.
'7': >-
  Having thus addressed Vaidehī, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, possessed by
  furious agitation of wrath, spoke further to Sītā.
'8': >-
  Two months are to be guarded by me as the term appointed for you by me;
  thereafter, O woman of excellent complexion, ascend my couch.
'9': >-
  If, after two months, you remain unwilling to accept me as your husband, then
  my cooks, at daybreak for my meal, will cut you to pieces.
'10': >-
  Seeing Jānakī thus threatened by the king of rākṣasas, those maidens of the
  devas and gandharvas became sorrowful, their faces distorted with grief.
'11': >-
  Some, by gestures of their lips; others, by their eyes and faces, sought to
  console Sītā, who had been terrorised by that rākṣasa.
'12': >-
  Consoled by them, Sītā then spoke to Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, words
  intended for his own good—words proud with steadfast courage.
'13': >-
  Surely there is no one among your people who stands firm in what leads to your
  welfare—no one who restrains you from this deed, so blameworthy.
'14': >-
  For who else, in the three worlds, would even in thought seek me—the righteous
  wife of the righteous-souled one—just as none would seek Śacī, the consort of
  Indra?
'15': >-
  O basest of rākṣasas, since you have spoken this sinful speech concerning the
  wife of Rāma of immeasurable splendour—where will you go to escape from it?
'16': >-
  As in a forest a proud rutting elephant and a hare might be set together, so
  is it: Rāma is like the elephant, while you, low one, are reckoned as the
  hare.
'17': >-
  And yet you do not feel shame while reviling the lord of the Ikṣvāku race
  here, until you come within the range of his sight.
'18': >-
  These eyes of yours are cruel, misshapen, dark and tawny; why have they not
  fallen to the ground, as you, ignoble one, look upon me?
'19': >-
  I am the wife of that righteous-souled one, and the daughter-in-law of
  Daśaratha; how does your tongue not split apart, O sinner, as you speak to me?
'20': >-
  Only because I have not received a message from Rāma, and because I must
  maintain my austerity, do I not reduce you, O Ten-necked one, to ashes by the
  fire of my power—power worthy to burn to ashes.
'21': >-
  I cannot be carried off from that wise Rāma. Fate has been ordained for your
  slaughter—of this there is no doubt.
'22': >-
  How is it that you committed this theft of another’s wife only by removing
  Rāma—who is a hero—when he was accompanied by the mighty one, the brother of
  the lord of wealth (Kubera), and by forces as well?
'23': >-
  Hearing Sītā’s words, Rāvaṇa, the lord of rākṣasas, widening his cruel eyes,
  gazed upon Jānakī.
'24': >-
  He was like a dark-blue rain-cloud in hue, bearing massive arms and head and
  shoulders; he moved with the gait and spirit of a lion; glorious, with blazing
  tongue and dreadful eyes.
'25': >-
  His tall crown trembled at its tip; he wore wondrous garlands and unguents;
  clad in red garlands and garments; adorned with heated armlets and ornaments.
'26': >-
  He was well girt with a great belt of dark hue about his hips—like Mount
  Mandara bound by a serpent at the churning for nectar.
'27': >-
  With those two full, well-rounded arms, the lord of rākṣasas shone, like a
  mountain—like Mandara with its twin peaks.
'28': >-
  Adorned with two earrings of the colour of the rising sun, he looked like a
  mountain with two aśoka trees—red with fresh shoots and blossoms.
'29': >-
  He was like a wish-fulfilling tree, like spring made manifest; and yet, even
  though ornamented, he was terrifying—like a cremation-ground shrine.
'30': >-
  Gazing at Vaidehī with eyes reddened by anger, Rāvaṇa spoke to Sītā, hissing
  like a serpent.
'31': >-
  “O you who are devoted to your husband, you are possessed of misconduct and
  devoid of sense; today I shall destroy you, as the sun by its power destroys
  the twilight.”
'32': >-
  Having thus spoken to Maithilī, the king Rāvaṇa, the harasser of foes, then
  looked upon all those rākṣasīs of dreadful appearance.
'33': >-
  Some were one-eyed, some one-eared; some had their ears covered; some had ears
  like a cow’s, some like an elephant’s; some had pendulous ears, some had no
  ear-lobes.
'34': >-
  Some had feet like an elephant’s, some like a horse’s; some had feet like a
  cow’s; some had feet with anklet-like tufts; some were one-eyed and
  one-footed; some broad-footed; some footless.
'35': >-
  Some had heads and necks of excessive size; some had overlarge breasts and
  bellies; some had overlarge mouths and eyes; some had long tongues and nails
  as well.
'36': >-
  Some were noseless; some lion-faced; some cow-faced; some boar-faced. “Make
  Sītā, Jānakī, quickly come under my control.”
'37': >-
  “Do so, O rākṣasīs—all of you—coming together quickly, by means of persuasion
  and gifts, and by sowing dissension, using both harsh and gentle methods, in
  every way.”
'38': >-
  “Turn Vaidehī toward me, even by the threat of raising the rod.” Thus did the
  lord of rākṣasas repeatedly instruct them.
'39': >-
  With his mind overpowered by desire and wrath, he roared at Jānakī. Then the
  rākṣasī Dhānyamālinī quickly approached.
'40': >-
  Embracing Ten-necked Rāvaṇa, she spoke these words: “Sport with me, O great
  king. What need have you of this Sītā?”
'41': >-
  “She is of poor colour, wretched, and human, O lord of rākṣasas. Surely, O
  great king, in her the gods have not bestowed supreme pleasures.”
'42': >-
  “The best of immortals provide for you delights won by the strength of your
  own arms; but desiring one who is unwilling, your body is only tormented.”
'43': >-
  “But when one desires a woman who herself desires, then affection becomes fair
  and fitting.” Thus addressed by the rākṣasī, the mighty one was lifted up in
  spirit; laughing, cloud-hued, that rākṣasa turned back.
'44': >-
  That Ten-necked one set forth, as though shaking the earth, and entered his
  dwelling, which shone like the blazing sun.
'45': >-
  Then those maidens of devas and gandharvas, and those nāga maidens,
  surrounding Ten-necked Rāvaṇa, entered that excellent mansion.
'46': >-
  Thus Rāvaṇa, having threatened Maithilī—steadfast in dharma, remaining firm,
  and trembling—abandoned Sītā and, deluded by passion, Rāvaṇa entered his own
  palace.
'47': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-second canto of Sundara-kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, entitled “The Stipulation of Two Months.”
