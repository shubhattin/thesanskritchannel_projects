  Now begins the First Canto of Kishkindhā-kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  entitled “Rāma’s Overwhelming Anguish in Separation (from Sītā).”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, accompanied by Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), went to that lotus-lake,
  thronged with lotuses, blue-waterlilies, and fish; and, his senses overcome
  with turmoil, he lamented aloud.
'2': >-
  There, on beholding that lake, his senses trembled with joy; and he—having
  fallen under the power of desire—spoke these words to Saumitri.
'3': >-
  “Saumitri, Pampā is resplendent—her waters are crystal-clear like vaidūrya
  (lapis-lazuli/beryl); she is rich with fully-blown lotuses and waterlilies,
  and adorned with trees of many kinds.”
'4': >-
  “Saumitri, behold Pampā’s forest—fair to look upon—where the mountains shine,
  and the trees appear as though they were mountains with peaks.”
'5': >-
  “But as for me—burned by sorrow—anguish indeed torments me: through Bharata’s
  grief, and through the abduction of Vaidehī (Sītā).”
'6': >-
  “Even to me, though stricken by grief, Pampā—whose woodland is
  variegated—appears lovely: strewn with flowers of many kinds, cool-watered,
  and auspicious.”
'7': >-
  “Covered everywhere with lotus-plants, exceedingly delightful to behold,
  haunted by serpents and fierce beasts, and filled with deer and birds—”
'8': >-
  “—this blue-and-golden meadow-grass shines all the more, as though offered up
  with spread-out coverings made of the diverse blossoms of the trees.”
'9': >-
  “All around, the ridges and crests are heavy with loads of flowers, and on
  every side are embraced by creepers whose tips are in bloom.”
'10': >-
  “This gentle breeze, Saumitri—this season teeming with Kāma (love)—is
  fragrant; this delightful month has come, wherein trees bear flowers and
  fruits.”
'11': >-
  “Behold, Saumitri, the forms of these forests laden with blossoms, pouring
  forth showers of flowers, as cloud-masses pour down rain-water.”
'12': >-
  “And on pleasant rocky grounds, trees of many kinds in the woods—stirred by
  the force of the wind—scatter flowers upon the earth.”
'13': >-
  “With flowers that have fallen, that are still falling, and that cling upon
  the branches, the wind—look, Saumitri—seems to be sporting everywhere with
  blossoms.”
'14': >-
  “Tossing the many blossom-laden branches of the trees, the wind is, as it
  were, sung to by bees whose positions shift with its motion.”
'15': >-
  “With the cries of intoxicated cuckoos, as though making the trees dance, that
  breeze—issuing from mountain-caves—seems as though it were chanting in song.”
'16': >-
  “By that wind, strongly scattering things all around, these trees—whose
  branch-tips touch and cling—appear as though they were woven together.”
'17': >-
  “That very breeze, delightful to the touch, blows cool like sandalwood,
  bearing a holy fragrance and removing weariness.”
'18': >-
  “These trees—shaken by the wind—seem to be resounding, in honey-scented
  forests, along with the humming of bees.”
'19': >-
  “On charming mountain-slopes with delightful flowering trees, the
  mountains—whose peaks seem joined together—shine with mighty trees.”
'20': >-
  “With peaks covered in flowers and made tremulous by gusts of wind, these
  trees—crowned with bees—appear as though they were singing.”
'21': >-
  “See these karnikāra trees, blooming all about—covered, as it were, with
  gold—like men clad in yellow garments.”
'22': >-
  “This spring, Saumitri—filled with the cries of many birds—kindles my grief,
  for I am separated from Sītā.”
'23': >-
  “Kāma scorches me, who am seized by sorrow; and the cuckoo, speaking forth in
  gladness, seems to be calling me to him.”
'24': >-
  “This jubilant dātyūha bird, crying out in the lovely forest-stream, will make
  me—who am possessed by love—lament, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'25': >-
  “Formerly, on hearing this very sound, my beloved—dwelling in our
  hermitage—would call me to her, rejoicing greatly.”
'26': >-
  “See, these wondrous birds, clamorous with many different calls; and look at
  the trees, shrubs, and creepers—everywhere they hover and alight.”
'27': >-
  “Birds of varied hues, accompanied by their mates and delighting in their own
  formations—gladdened like kings of bees—sweet-voiced, O Saumitri.”
'28': >-
  “On this bank, the birds here—gathered in flocks—cry out: with the amorous
  calls of dātyūhas, and with the notes of male cuckoos as well.”
'29': >-
  “And these trees resound—kindling my desire—like embers of aśoka-clusters; and
  there is the ceaseless buzzing-hum of bees.”
'30': >-
  “The spring-fire, whose flames are the red shoots, will surely burn me up; for
  I do not behold that delicate-lashed, fine-haired, gentle-speaking one.”
'31': >-
  “For me, Saumitri, what purpose is there in life when I do not see her? This
  is indeed the lovely season for her—this forest is lovely at this time.”
'32': >-
  “O sinless one, the very borderlands crowded with cuckoos—belonging to my
  beloved—springing from the exertions of Kāma and enhanced by the virtues of
  spring—”
'33': >-
  “—will quickly burn me, like the fire of grief before long: I do not see that
  woman, yet I behold these lovely trees.”
'34': >-
  “This grief, born of my own self, will come upon me all the more; Vaidehī,
  unseen, increases my sorrow here.”
'35': >-
  “And spring, while seen, corrupts one with the contact of sweat; that doe-eyed
  one, by the force of anxiety and grief, torments me.”
'36': >-
  “Saumitri, this cruel breeze of the Caitra woods afflicts me; and those
  peacocks, dancing here and there, appear splendid.”
'37': >-
  “Like crystal windows with their openings, their wings are lifted by the wind;
  and surrounded by peahens, those peacocks are intoxicated and faint with
  rapture.”
'38': >-
  “Look, Lakṣmaṇa: for me, who am beset by Kāma, these things only increase
  Kāma—this dancing peacock makes even another peacock dance.”
'39': >-
  “This peahen, tortured by love, approaches her lord on the mountain-slope; and
  the peacock too follows after her, thinking upon her alone.”
'40': >-
  “Spreading his lovely wings and seeming to mock with his cries, surely in this
  forest the peacock’s beloved has not been stolen by a rākṣasa.”
'41': >-
  “Therefore he dances in these lovely forests together with his mate; but for
  me, dwelling without her in this flower-month is utterly unbearable.”
'42': >-
  “See, Lakṣmaṇa, how passion exists even among beings of animal birth—since
  this peahen, through desire, turns toward her mate.”
'43': >-
  “So too would wide-eyed Jānakī—stirred by love—turn toward me, if she had not
  been carried off.”
'44': >-
  “Look, Lakṣmaṇa: these blossoms become fruitless for me—though the forests are
  rich with the weight of flowers when winter has passed.”
'45': >-
  “Even these lovely blossoms—exceedingly splendid upon the trees—fall to the
  earth fruitless, along with swarms of bees.”
'46': >-
  “Birds, delighted in flocks, sing sweetly at will, as though calling one
  another—yet they drive me mad with love.”
'47': >-
  “If spring exists even there where my beloved dwells, surely Sītā—under
  another’s power—laments, just as I do.”
'48': >-
  “Surely spring does not touch that land where she is; for how could that
  dark-lotus-eyed woman live without me?”
'49': >-
  “Or else spring does exist there where my beloved is—yet what can that
  fair-hipped lady do, when she is being reviled by others?”
'50': >-
  “My beloved—dark, lotus-petal-eyed, and gentle-speaking—surely, upon the
  coming of spring, will abandon her life.”
'51': >-
  “Firmly my conviction turns over in my heart: Sītā, virtuous and taken into
  separation from me, is not able to endure.”
'52': >-
  “Truly Vaidehī’s whole being is, in reality, set upon me; and my whole being
  too is, in every way, set upon Sītā.”
'53': >-
  “This wind that carries flowers—pleasant to the touch and cool—becomes to me,
  as I think of my beloved, like fire itself.”
'54': >-
  “I always thought that breeze a delight, when formerly it blew together with
  Sītā; but that very wind, without Sītā, becomes for me a begetter of sorrow.”
'55': >-
  “And there, on a tree, that bird—the crow—calls out in joy; without her, even
  such sounds then cry aloud.”
'56': >-
  “This bird is indeed a messenger of Vaidehī there; this bird will bring me
  near to the wide-eyed lady.”
'57': >-
  “Look, Lakṣmaṇa: in the forest there is a sound that increases my
  rapture—birds chirping upon the flowering tops of trees.”
'58': >-
  “That tilaka-cluster, tossed by the wind—toward it a bee rushes at once, as
  though to a beloved woman driven into motion by intoxication.”
'59': >-
  “For those in love, this aśoka is exceedingly a increaser of grief; standing
  there, it seems to threaten me with its clusters lifted up by the wind.”
'60': >-
  “These mango trees, Lakṣmaṇa, are seen, rich with blossoms—like men dyed with
  passion, their minds arrogant with dalliance.”
'61': >-
  “Saumitri, look: in the painted woodland-belts of Pampā, kinnara-folk wander
  here and there, O tiger among men.”
'62': >-
  “Behold, Lakṣmaṇa, everywhere these lotuses of auspicious fragrance shine in
  the water like the rising young sun.”
'63': >-
  “This Pampā—clear-watered, filled with lotuses and blue waterlilies, strewn
  with swans and kāraṇḍavas, and rich with fragrance—lies before us.”
'64': >-
  “In the water, encircled on every side with lotuses whose hue is like the
  young sun, and whose filaments are struck by bees, Pampā shines.”
'65': >-
  “Ever accompanied by cakravāka birds, with the inner forests of Citrakūṭa’s
  slopes nearby, Pampā is adorned by herds of elephants and deer seeking water.”
'66': >-
  “In the pure water, the lotuses shine, O Lakṣmaṇa, being struck and beaten by
  waves whose speed is driven by the wind.”
'67': >-
  “Without seeing Vaidehī—she of eyes wide like lotus-leaves, ever dear to
  lotuses—life does not please me.”
'68': >-
  “Ah, the perversity of Kāma—he who will make me remember even that virtuous
  lady, hard to regain though lost, whose speech was ever more auspicious.”
'69': >-
  “I might be able to endure Kāma when he arises in me, if spring, with its
  flowering trees, did not strike me again and again.”
'70': >-
  “The very things that used to be delightful to me together with her—those very
  things become undelightful to me without her.”
'71': >-
  “To look upon lotus-buds and their petals—my gaze thinks them like Sītā’s
  eyelids, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'72': >-
  “The lovely wind blows, mingled with lotus-filaments and issuing from between
  the trees, like the breath of Sītā herself.”
'73': >-
  “Saumitri, look—on the southern mountain-slopes of Pampā—at the staff-like
  stem of the karnikāra, in bloom and exceedingly beautiful.”
'74': >-
  “This lord of mountains, adorned with minerals, creates wondrous dust—struck
  and shaken up by the force of the wind.”
'75': >-
  “And the mountain-ledges, Saumitri—everywhere—are all in bloom, and, being
  lovely on all sides and leafless, blaze as though with kiṃśuka trees.”
'76': >-
  “And these, growing on Pampā’s banks, are moistened and honey-scented: mālatī,
  mallikā, lotus, and karavīra—all in bloom.”
'77': >-
  “Ketakī, sinduvāra, and vāsinṭī are well-flowered; mādhavī creepers are full
  of fragrance; and kundā shrubs are everywhere.”
'78': >-
  “Ciribilva, madhūka, vañjula, and bakula likewise; campaka and tilaka; and
  nāga trees too—are in bloom.”
'79': >-
  “Padmaka trees also shine, and nīlāśoka trees are in bloom; and lodhra trees
  on the mountain-backs, tawny like a lion’s mane.”
'80': >-
  “Aṅkola and kuraṇṭa, cūrṇaka and pārijāta; mango and pāṭala; and kovidāra
  too—are in bloom.”
'81': >-
  “Mucukunda and arjuna are seen on the mountain-slopes; and ketaka and
  uddālaka; and śirīṣa, śiṃśapā, and dhava.”
'82': >-
  “Śālmali and kiṃśuka; red kurabaka likewise; tiniśa and naktamāla; sandalwood
  and syandana as well.”
'83': >-
  “Hintāla and tilaka, and nāga trees too, are in bloom—trees in bloom, wrapped
  about by creepers whose tips are in flower.”
'84': >-
  “See here, Saumitri, many lovely trees of Pampā—branches tossed by the
  wind—these trees standing near at hand.”
'85': >-
  “Creepers follow along, like intoxicated noble women—going from tree to tree,
  from hill to hill, from forest to forest.”
'86': >-
  “The breeze blows as though rejoicing in the taste of many nectars; and some
  trees, filled with abundant blossoms, are honey-scented.”
'87': >-
  “Some, covered with buds, appeared as though dark-hued—‘This is ripe, this is
  sweet, this is blossomed,’ as though proclaiming so.”
'88': >-
  “The bee, reddened with passion, hides itself among the blossoms; then, hiding
  and again flying up, it suddenly goes elsewhere—greedy for honey, that bee
  among the trees on Pampā’s bank.”
'89': >-
  “This ground is strewn with masses of flowers and made pleasant, as though
  with couches for sleep, by blossoms fallen of themselves.”
'90': >-
  “On the mountain-slopes, spread out with those various flowers, broad rocky
  beds—yellow and red in hue—have been made, O Saumitri.”
'91': >-
  “At the end of winter, look, Saumitri, at the arising of blossoms on the
  trees; in the month of flowers the trees bloom, as though through mutual
  friction.”
'92': >-
  “The mountains, resounding with the hum of bees, seem to call to one another;
  their branches adorned with floral ornaments appear exceedingly beautiful, O
  Lakṣmaṇa.”
'93': >-
  “This kāraṇḍava bird, plunging into the auspicious waters, sports together
  with its mate, as though inflaming desire.”
'94': >-
  “This form of the Mandākinī is indeed most delightful; rightly in the world
  her charming virtues are famed.”
'95': >-
  “If only that virtuous lady (Sītā) were to be seen, and if we were to dwell
  here—then I would not envy Indra, nor even Ayodhyā, O best of the Raghus.”
'96': >-
  “For if, in such delightful grassy meadows, I were to sport with her, no
  anxiety would arise in me, nor would there be longing for anything else.”
'97': >-
  “These trees in this forest, with varied foliage and varied blossoms—without
  my beloved—give rise to anxious thoughts in me.”
'98': >-
  “Behold, Saumitri, this cool-watered lake, filled with lotuses, frequented by
  cakravākas and resorted to by kāraṇḍavas.”
'99': >-
  “Filled with plavas and krauñcas, inhabited by great beasts, Pampā shines all
  the more with the cries of birds.”
'100': >-
  “These joyous birds, of many kinds, seem to kindle my desire—while I remember
  my beloved: dark-complexioned, moon-faced, lotus-eyed.”
'101': >-
  “See, upon the variegated slopes, the deer together with does; as they move
  here and there, they seem to distress my heart—for I have been made separated
  from Vaidehī, she of fawn-like eyes.”
'102': >-
  “On this lovely slope, thronged with flocks of intoxicated birds—if I were to
  see that beloved one, then well-being would arise for me.”
'103': >-
  “I would indeed live, Saumitri, if slender-waisted Vaidehī, together with me,
  were to enjoy Pampā’s auspicious breeze.”
'104': >-
  “Bearing the fragrance of lotuses and saugandhikas, auspicious and a destroyer
  of grief—blessed are those, O Lakṣmaṇa, who partake of Pampā’s forest-wind.”
'105': >-
  “My beloved—dark, lotus-petal-eyed—has been parted from me; how does the
  daughter of Janaka, helpless, sustain her life-breaths?”
'106': >-
  “What shall I say, in the assembly of people, to King Janaka—knower of dharma
  and speaker of truth—when he asks of Sītā’s welfare?”
'107': >-
  “She who followed me when I was gently sent forth by my father to the
  forest—Sītā, established in dharma—where now does that beloved one dwell?”
'108': >-
  “Deprived of her, wretched, how shall I endure, O Lakṣmaṇa—she who followed me
  when I had fallen from the kingdom, my mind struck down?”
'109': >-
  “Not beholding her face—lovely, lotus-eyed, fragrant, auspicious, and
  unblemished—my understanding seems to sink and fail.”
'110': >-
  “Having met with suffering in the forest, that dark-hued virtuous lady, seeing
  me drawn by Kāma, spoke to me as though my grief were gone, as though she were
  rejoicing.”
'111': >-
  “What shall I say in Ayodhyā to Kausalyā, O prince—when that high-minded lady
  asks, ‘Where is my daughter-in-law?’”
'112': >-
  “Go, Lakṣmaṇa—go and see Bharata, devoted to his brothers; for I am not able
  to live without the daughter of Janaka.”
'113': >-
  Thus, while the great-souled Rāma lamented like one without refuge, his
  brother Lakṣmaṇa spoke to him words fitting and unfailing.
'114': >-
  “Be steadfast, Rāma—good be to you, O best of men; do not grieve. Such a
  feeble resolve does not befit those whose selves are stainless.”
'115': >-
  “Remembering the sorrow born of separation, abandon excessive attachment
  toward the beloved; for even a wet wick is burned by the close embrace of
  flame.”
'116': >-
  “Even if he goes down to Pātāla—or even farther still—in no way will Rāvaṇa
  survive, O Rāghava, dear brother.”
'117': >-
  “First, let us obtain intelligence regarding that sinful rākṣasa; then he will
  either release Sītā, or he will go to his destruction.”
'118': >-
  “Even if Rāvaṇa, together with Sītā, should enter the womb of Diti (i.e., the
  nether regions/most inaccessible place), even there I will slay him—unless he
  gives back Maithilī.”
'119': >-
  “Take up composure and благополучие, noble one; let this wretched thought be
  abandoned. For the means to accomplish what must be done are not gained
  without effort when the objective is lost.”
'120': >-
  “Effort (utsāha) is mighty, noble one; there is no strength greater than
  effort. For one endowed with effort, nothing whatsoever is unattainable in the
  worlds.”
'121': >-
  “Men possessed of effort do not sink in their undertakings. Relying on effort
  alone, we shall regain Jānakī.”
'122': >-
  “Abandon the ways of desire, casting sorrow behind you. You do not recognize
  yourself as a great-souled one—self-controlled and accomplished.”
'123': >-
  Thus addressed by him, Rāma—his mind smitten by grief—abandoned sorrow and
  delusion, and attained firmness of courage.
'124': >-
  Then that Rāma, of inconceivable prowess, proceeded without distraction,
  passing beyond lovely Pampā, enchanting, with beautiful trees along its
  shores.
'125': >-
  Suddenly surveying the entire forest—with its springs and caves—while his
  heart was agitated, that great-souled one, together with Lakṣmaṇa, reflected,
  afflicted by grief, and set forth onward.
'126': >-
  As Rāghava went on—moving with the leisurely gait of an intoxicated elephant,
  his mind undistracted—the noble Lakṣmaṇa, whose conduct was pleasing,
  protected him by righteousness and by strength.
'127': >-
  Then, wandering near Ṛṣyamūka, the valiant lord of the monkeys beheld those
  two—wondrous and worthy to be seen—and he was struck with fear; he neither
  stood firm nor acted with composed action.
'128': >-
  That great monkey, moving with an elephant’s gentle gait, seeing those two as
  they wandered there, fell into deep dejection—beset by anxious thought and
  broken by the burden of fear.
'129': >-
  Seeing those two—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, of great energy—at that hermitage, a holy
  and happy refuge, ever frequented by monkeys, the monkeys, terrified, came
  near.
'130': >-
  Thus ends the First Canto of Kishkindhā-kāṇḍa in the sacred, ancient, Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Rāma’s Overwhelming Anguish in Separation (from Sītā).”
