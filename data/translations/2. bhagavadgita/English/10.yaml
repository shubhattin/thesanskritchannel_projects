'0': Om. Salutations to the Supreme Self (the Supreme Lord).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': 'Now, the Tenth Chapter: The Yoga of Divine Manifestations (Vibhūti-yoga).'
'3': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'4': >-
  Once again, O mighty-armed one, hear My supreme word, which, seeking your
  welfare, I shall speak to you who are dear to Me and in whom I take delight.
'5': >-
  Neither the hosts of the gods nor the great sages know My origin; for in every
  way I am the beginning of the gods and of the great sages.
'6': >-
  He who knows Me as unborn and without beginning, as the great Lord of the
  worlds—he among mortals is undeluded and is freed from all sins.
'7': >-
  Intellect, knowledge, non-delusion, forgiveness, truth, self-restraint,
  tranquility; pleasure and pain; birth and death; fear and fearlessness as
  well—
'8': >-
  Non-violence, equanimity, contentment, austerity, charity, fame and
  infamy—these diverse states of being of creatures arise from Me alone.
'9': >-
  The seven great sages, and the four ancient Manus as well, were born from My
  mind, partaking of My nature; from them have sprung these creatures in the
  world.
'10': >-
  He who truly knows this glory (vibhūti) of Mine and this Yoga (My divine power
  of manifestation) is united with unwavering Yoga; of this there is no doubt.
'11': >-
  I am the source of all; from Me everything proceeds. Knowing thus, the wise
  worship Me, endowed with devotion (bhāva).
'12': >-
  With their minds fixed on Me, their life-breaths devoted to Me, enlightening
  one another and ever speaking of Me, they are satisfied and rejoice.
'13': >-
  To those who are ever steadfast, who worship Me with love, I grant that Yoga
  of understanding (buddhi-yoga) by which they come to Me.
'14': >-
  Out of mere compassion for them, abiding within their very Self, I destroy the
  darkness born of ignorance with the luminous lamp of knowledge.
'15': 'Arjuna said:'
'16': >-
  You are the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Abode, the Supreme Purifier; the
  eternal Divine Person, the primal God, unborn, all-pervading.
'17': >-
  All the sages declare You thus—also the divine sage Nārada; Asita, Devala, and
  Vyāsa; and You Yourself say so to me.
'18': >-
  I deem all this to be true which You tell me, O Keśava; for, O Lord, neither
  the gods nor the demons know Your manifestation.
'19': >-
  Indeed, You Yourself know Yourself by Yourself, O Supreme Person; O Origin of
  beings, O Lord of beings, O God of gods, O Lord of the universe!
'20': >-
  You ought to declare, without remainder, Your divine glories, by which glories
  You pervade and abide sustaining these worlds.
'21': >-
  How shall I know You, O Yogi, by constantly meditating upon You? And in what
  aspects and conditions are You to be contemplated by me, O Blessed Lord?
'22': >-
  Tell me again in detail, O Janārdana, of Your Yoga and Your manifestations;
  for there is no satiety for me in hearing your nectar-like words.
'23': 'The Blessed Lord said:'

  Kurus, chiefly; for there is no end to My विस्तार (detailed expanse).

'37': >-
  Of creations I am the beginning, the end, and also the middle, O Arjuna; among
  knowledges I am the knowledge of the Self (adhyātma-vidyā); and among
  disputants I am right reasoning (vāda).
'38': >-
  Among letters I am ‘A’; and of compound-words I am the dual (dvandva); I alone
  am inexhaustible Time; I am the Creator, facing in all directions.

  And I am Death, the all-seizing; and I am the origin of all that is to come.

  There is no end to My divine manifestations, O scorcher of foes; this detailed
  account of My manifestation has been spoken by Me only in brief indication.
'46': >-
  Whatever being there is that is endowed with glory, prosperity, or power—know
  that to be born of a portion of My splendor.
'47': >-
  Or, what need is there of this extensive knowledge for you, O Arjuna? I
  sustain this entire universe with a single fragment of Myself, and remain.
'48': >-
