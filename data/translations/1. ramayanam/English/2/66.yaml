  Now begins the sixty-sixth chapter in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the blessed Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Lying of the King in the Oil-Trough.”
'1': >-
  Beholding the lord of the earth lying thus—like fire that has been quenched,
  like an ocean bereft of water, like the sun whose splendour is struck down,
  like one who has gone to heaven—(they were overwhelmed with grief).
'2': >-
  Kauśalyā, her eyes filled with tears and wasted by manifold sorrow, clasping
  the king’s head close, spoke to Kaikeyī.
'3': >-
  “Be thou satisfied in thy desire, O Kaikeyī; enjoy the kingdom without a thorn
  (without obstacle), having abandoned the king, foremost among men—O cruel one,
  O woman of evil conduct.
'4': >-
  “Rāma has gone, leaving me behind, and my husband too has gone to heaven. Like
  a caravan that has lost its company on a wrong road, I am not able—indeed I
  have no heart—to live.
'5': >-
  “Having forsaken such a husband, what woman would wish to live anywhere else,
  making another her refuge, if she had not been cast off from
  righteousness—like Kaikeyī, who has abandoned dharma?”
'6': >-
  “The greedy do not perceive their faults, as though eating food that is yet
  unripe. Because of the humpbacked maid as the occasion, by Kaikeyī the
  Rāghavas’ lineage has been ruined.”
'7': >-
  “By the king, constrained by an improper compulsion, Rāma has been banished.
  Hearing it, Janaka (Sītā’s father) will surely fall down (stricken), even as I
  have fallen.”
'8': >-
  “Now that righteous Rāma, lotus-petalled-eyed, who has gone from here, does
  not know me to be helpless and widowed, bereft of support, with my life
  well-nigh ended.”
'9': >-
  “And that ascetic lady Sītā, the daughter of the king of Videha—unfit for
  sorrow—will be sorely distressed by sorrow in the forest.”
'10': >-
  “Hearing at nights the terrible cries of roaring beasts and birds, she will
  surely be frightened, and will take refuge in Rāghava.”
'11': >-
  “Old and having but one son, not thinking of Vaidehī at all—he too, immersed
  in grief, will surely abandon his life.”
'12': >-
  “Therefore I, a devoted wife, shall today itself go the way appointed (for
  me). Embracing this body, I will enter the fire.”
'13': >-
  Then the women of the inner apartments, embracing that ascetic lady who was
  wailing and afflicted with exceeding sorrow, led Kauśalyā away, distressed and
  crying aloud.
'14': >-
  Then the ministers, having placed the lord of the world in an oil-trough, were
  thereafter instructed in all matters, and they performed the king’s rites and
  duties in due order.
'15': >-
  But without the prince, the ministers—though all-knowing—did not desire to
  arrange the king’s funeral preparations; therefore they kept guard over the
  ruler.
'16': >-
  When the king of men had been laid by the counsellors in the oil-trough, the
  women, knowing, “Alas, he is dead,” lamented around him.
'17': >-
  Raising up their arms, wretched, their faces streaming with tears, they wept,
  scorched by grief, and lamented piteously.
'18': >-
  “Alas, great king! Ever cherished by Rāma, who spoke words ever dear—why hast
  thou left us, thou who wast true to thy vow?”
'19': >-
  “Severed from Rāghava by Kaikeyī of evil nature, how shall we live near that
  husband-slaying woman, we widows?”
'20': >-
  “For he was always our protector, and thine too—self-possessed and mighty. Yet
  illustrious Rāma has gone to the forest, abandoning the royal fortune.”
'21': >-
  “Without thee and without that hero, bewildered by calamity, how shall we
  dwell—defiled and dishonoured by Kaikeyī?”
'22': >-
  “She by whom the king, and Rāma, and mighty-armed Lakṣmaṇa—along with
  Sītā—have been cast away: will she ever laugh at anyone else?”
'23': >-
  Thus those foremost women of Rāghava, enveloped in tears and in vast sorrow,
  writhed about joyless and despondent.
'24': >-
  Like a night devoid of stars, like a woman bereft of her husband, Ayodhyā, the
  city, did not shine—bereft of the great-souled king.
'25': >-
  Its people were confounded with tears; its womenfolk were crying “Alas! Alas!”
  Its squares and the inner parts of its houses were empty; it did not appear as
  it had before.
'26': >-
  Like the sky without the sun, deprived of splendour; like the night when the
  multitude of stars has vanished; when the sun has suddenly set and all
  activity has ceased—then the night, with its own courses, came forth and took
  its place.
'27': >-
  But the cremation of the lord of earth—without his son—was not approved by the
  assembled friends. Thus, as though with that thought, they laid the king upon
  that bed (in the oil-trough), pondering upon the king, whose sight was hard to
  endure (to behold in such a state).
'28': >-
  Like the sky without the sun, bereft of light; like the night without the host
  of stars—so the city appeared, deprived of that great-souled king; and its
  roads and squares were not thronged with people, nor were voices and cries
  heard.
'29': >-
  Then men and women, gathering in groups, censuring the mother of Bharata,
  became afflicted in the city at the destruction of the godlike man (the king),
  and they found no comfort.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-sixth chapter of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Lying of the King in the Oil-Trough.”
