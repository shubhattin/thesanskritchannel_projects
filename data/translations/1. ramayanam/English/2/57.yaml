  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-seventh canto, entitled “The Return of Sumantra.”
'1': >-
  Having long spoken with Sumantra in anguish and deep sorrow, Guha—while Rāma
  was staying on the southern bank—went back to his own house.
'2': >-
  Their meeting with Bharadvāja, and their sitting together at Prayāga, and
  their going thence to Āṅgiri (the sage’s hermitage)—all this was clearly
  observed and noted by those who were there.
'3': >-
  Then Sumantra, having taken leave, and having harnessed the excellent steeds,
  set out for the city of Ayodhyā itself, his heart weighed down with grievous
  dejection.
'4': >-
  Beholding fragrant forests, rivers, and lakes, he hurried swiftly onward,
  passing by villages and towns.
'5': >-
  Then, at the time of evening, on the third day, the charioteer reached Ayodhyā
  and beheld her bereft of joy.
'6': >-
  Seeing the city as though empty and without sound, Sumantra became exceedingly
  downcast, and, overpowered by the force of grief, fell into anxious thought.
'7': >-
  “Is the city—together with its elephants and horses, its people and its
  lords—burnt up by the fire of sorrow, scorched by the anguish arising from
  Rāma?”
'8': >-
  Thus absorbed in worry, the charioteer, with his swift-footed horses, came up
  to the city gate and, in haste, entered within.
'9': >-
  As Sumantra approached, men, by hundreds and by thousands, rushed toward the
  charioteer, asking, “Where is Rāma? Where has he gone?”
'10': >-
  To them he related: “After taking leave of Rāghava on the Gaṅgā, I have
  returned—dismissed by that righteous and great-souled one.”
'11': >-
  Knowing that they had crossed over, the people, their faces filled with tears,
  drew long sighs and cried, “Alas! Fie upon it!” and “Ha, Rāma!”
'12': >-
  And he heard, from group after group standing there, their words: “Surely we
  are as good as slain, if we do not behold Rāghava here!”
'13': >-
  “At gifts, sacrifices, and weddings, and at great public gatherings, never
  again shall we behold righteous Rāma!”
'14': >-
  “What now is possible for this people? What is dear to them, what brings them
  happiness? For by Rāma the city was governed like a father governs his
  children.”
'15': >-
  And from women standing along the streets and marketplaces, afflicted and
  scorched by grief for Rāma, he heard lamentation and wailing.
'16': >-
  Then Sumantra, his face covered, went along the middle of the royal road, and
  made his way to that very palace where King Daśaratha was.
'17': >-
  Alighting quickly from the chariot and entering the king’s residence, he
  passed through seven courtyards, thronged with multitudes of people.
'18': >-
  From mansions, aerial pavilions, and palaces, seeing him arrive, the
  women—worn down by longing for the sight of Rāma—raised a great cry of
  lamentation.
'19': >-
  With large, clear eyes flooded by a rush of tears, the women looked at one
  another, their grief all the more intense, their words indistinct.
'20': >-
  Then, from here and there in the women’s apartments—within those
  palaces—Daśaratha faintly heard the murmured talk of women tormented by sorrow
  for Rāma.
'21': >-
  “He went out with Rāma, yet has come back here without Rāma. What indeed will
  the charioteer say to Kauśalyā as she mourns?”
'22': >-
  “And as I think, it is certain that it will be hard indeed to live—nay, not
  easy at all—if Kauśalyā can yet live after her son has been torn away and has
  departed.”
'23': >-
  Hearing those words—which truly reflected the state of things—spoken by the
  king’s women, he entered the house at once, as though set ablaze by sorrow.
'24': >-
  Entering the eighth chamber, he saw the king, wretched and distressed,
  withered by grief for his son, in that pale and cheerless hall.
'25': >-
  Approaching that lord of men as he sat there, and bowing to him, Sumantra
  conveyed—exactly as it had been spoken—the message and words of Rāma.
'26': >-
  But the king, hearing it, remained silent, his mind unsteady; then, tormented
  by grief for Rāma, he swooned and fell to the ground.
'27': >-
  When the lord of the earth fainted, the inner apartments were thrown into
  turmoil; and, as the king fell upon the ground, they lifted up their arms and
  cried aloud.
'28': >-
  Then Kauśalyā, together with Sumitrā, raised up her fallen husband, and spoke
  these words:
'29': >-
  “This messenger of that greatly fortunate Rāma, the doer of difficult deeds,
  has returned from the forest-dwelling—why do you not speak to him?”
'30': >-
  “O Rāghava (descendant of Raghu), today you are ashamed after bringing him
  here. Rise up; may merit be yours. In sorrow there is no helper.”
'31': >-
  “By fear of what god is it that you do not question the charioteer about Rāma?
  Kaikeyī is not standing here; speak freely.”
'32': >-
  Having thus spoken to the great king, Kauśalyā—eager for grief, her speech
  drenched in tears—quickly fell down upon the earth.
'33': >-
  Seeing Kauśalyā thus lamenting, fallen upon the ground, and looking upon their
  husband as well, all the women wept aloud with a clear, ringing cry.
'34': >-
  Then, seeing that wail arise within the women’s quarters, old and young men,
  and all the women too, wept on every side; and the city then once again became
  wholly filled with tumult.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-seventh canto, entitled “The Return of Sumantra,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the venerable, illustrious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the
  first of poets.
