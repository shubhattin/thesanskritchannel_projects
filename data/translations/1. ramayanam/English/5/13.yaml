  Now begins the thirteenth sarga, named “Hanuman’s Despondency,” in the Sundara
  Kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana.
'1': >-
  Then the leader of the monkey-host, Hanuman, leapt down from the aerial car
  and crossed over to the rampart; swift of speed he was, like lightning
  flashing amid the clouds.
'2': >-
  Hanuman went all around Ravana’s many mansions; and not beholding Janaki Sita,
  the monkey spoke these words.
'3': >-
  Lanka has been searched again and again in full—by me, who act to accomplish
  what is dear to Rama; yet I do not see the Videha princess, Sita, whose every
  limb is lovely.
'4': >-
  Ponds and tanks, lakes and rivers; streams and groves of marshland;
  hard-to-reach fastnesses and mountain-peaks—
'5': >-
  the entire earth here has been thoroughly searched, and yet I do not behold
  Janaki. In this very place, in Ravana’s abode, Sampati—the king of
  vultures—declared that Sita was; and still she is not seen. What can this be?
'6': >-
  What indeed has become of Sita—Videhi, Maithili, the daughter of
  Janaka—helpless, when she was carried off by force by Ravana? Where could she
  be?
'7': >-
  Or perhaps, as I think, when the rakshasas were flying up swiftly with Sita,
  she fell down in the midst of the way, in fear of Rama’s arrows.
'8': >-
  Or else, while she was being borne away along that path frequented by siddhas,
  I think the noble lady, looking upon the ocean, cast her own heart
  down—overwhelmed.
'9': >-
  Pressed by Ravana’s furious speed and crushed by his arms, I think that noble
  lady of large eyes gave up her life.
'10': >-
  Surely, while crossing the ocean step by step in the sky, struggling and
  striving, Janaka’s daughter fell into the sea.
'11': >-
  Alas! And by this vile one—while she was guarding her own chastity—Sita, the
  ascetic lady, without kinsmen here, has been devoured by Ravana.
'12': >-
  Or else the dark-eyed, blameless Sita will have been devoured by the
  evil-natured wives of the lord of rakshasas.
'13': >-
  Gazing upon Rama’s face—like the full moon, with eyes like
  lotus-petals—wretched, she has gone to the state of the five elements (death).
'14': >-
  ‘Ha Rama! Ha Lakshmana!’—and ‘Alas, Ayodhya!’—thus lamenting much, the Videha
  princess will have laid down her body (given up her life).
'15': >-
  Or else, I think, she has been kept confined in Ravana’s dwelling, and is made
  to lament exceedingly, like a myna shut within a cage.
'16': >-
  Born in Janaka’s line, the wife of Rama, slender-waisted,
  lotus-petaled-eyed—how could she ever come under Ravana’s power?
'17': >-
  Whether Janaka’s daughter is destroyed, or lost, or dead—I am not able to
  report it, concerning Rama’s beloved wife.
'18': >-
  If I report it, there will be fault; if I do not report it, there will be
  fault. What indeed should be done? It appears to me a dire predicament.
'19': >-
  In this matter that has come to such a pass, what is timely and
  proper?—pondering thus again and again, Hanuman reflected.
'20': >-
  If, having not seen Sita, I go from here back to the city of the lord of
  monkeys, what manly achievement of mine will there be then?
'21': >-
  My leaping over the ocean will become fruitless, as also my entering Lanka and
  even beholding the rakshasas.
'22': >-
  Or what will Sugriva say—what will the assembled monkeys say—or the two sons
  of Dasharatha, when I return to Kishkindha?
'23': >-
  And if, going to the Kakutstha prince, I speak harsh words—‘By me Sita has not
  been seen’—then he will abandon his life.
'24': >-
  Harsh, dreadful, sharp, cruel words, tormenting to the senses—he will not
  endure such evil speech spoken for Sita’s sake.
'25': >-
  Seeing him fallen into misery, his mind gone to death, Lakshmana—wise and
  exceedingly devoted—will not continue to live.
'26': >-
  Hearing that the two brothers are lost, Bharata too will die; and seeing
  Bharata dead, Shatrughna will not remain alive.
'27': >-
  Then, beholding their sons dead, the mothers will not live—Kausalya and
  Sumitra and Kaikeyi, without doubt.
'28': >-
  Sugriva, lord of the monkeys, grateful and true to his pledge—seeing Rama thus
  departed—will thereafter abandon his life.
'29': >-
  Sad at heart, afflicted, wretched, joyless, an ascetic woman—oppressed by
  grief for her husband—Ruma will give up her life.
'30': >-
  Tormented by sorrow on account of Vali, wasted by grief, Queen Tara too—her
  mind gone to the five elements—will not remain alive.
'31': >-
  By the destruction of his mother and father, and by Sugriva’s calamity, Prince
  Angada too, therefore, will forsake his life.
'32': >-
  Overcome by grief on account of their lord, the forest-dwellers (the monkeys)
  will strike their own heads with their palms and fists.
'33': >-
  Cherished by the lord of monkeys through conciliation, gifts, honor, and fame,
  the vanaras will abandon their lives.
'34': >-
  Neither in forests, nor on mountains, nor again in restrained enclosures will
  those great elephants among monkeys, gathering together, enjoy their sports.
'35': >-
  With sons and wives, with ministers, oppressed by their lord’s calamity, they
  will leap from mountain-tops—on level ground or rugged places alike.
'36': >-
  Or they will resort to the dreadful act of hanging, or entering fire, or
  fasting, or weapons—such courses will the vanaras undertake.
'37': >-
  I think a terrible wailing will arise when I am gone; and there will be the
  destruction of the Ikshvaku line, and the destruction also of the
  forest-dwellers.
'38': >-
  Therefore I shall not go from here to Kishkindha, the city; for I shall not be
  able to look upon Sugriva without Maithili.
'39': >-
  If I do not go and remain here, those two righteous great chariot-warriors
  will sustain themselves by hope—and the mighty vanaras as well.
'40': >-
  Taking food by hand, taking drink by mouth, restrained, living at the roots of
  trees—I shall become a forest-dwelling ascetic if I do not behold Janaka’s
  daughter.
'41': >-
  In a region by the ocean, abounding in roots, fruits, and water, I shall build
  a funeral pyre and enter the fire kindled by the fire-drill.
'42': >-
  Or, seated properly, undertaking the practice of a mendicant’s marks and
  disciplines, my body will be eaten by crows and beasts of prey.
'43': >-
  This too, I think, has been regarded by the seers as a proper departure: I
  shall duly enter the waters, if I do not see Janaki.
'44': >-
  My well-rooted, fortunate, garlanded-with-fame, illustrious state has been
  shattered for a long night (a very long time), since I have not seen Sita.
'45': >-
  Or I shall become an ascetic, restrained, living at the roots of trees; I will
  not return, having not beheld the dark-eyed lady.
'46': >-
  But if I return without finding that Sita, Angada together with all the
  vanaras will not remain alive.
'47': >-
  In destruction there are many faults; while living one may attain good.
  Therefore I shall sustain my life—for union is certain for one who lives.
'48': >-
  Thus bearing in his mind manifold sorrow in great measure, that best of
  monkeys at that time did not reach the far shore of grief.
'49': >-
  Then, having recourse to valor, the steadfast best of monkeys thought: “Either
  I shall slay Ravana, the ten-necked one of great might; even if Sita has been
  carried away, it shall be repaid in kind.”
'50': >-
  Or else, lifting him up, I shall carry him over the ocean and offer him to
  Rama, like a beast to Pashupati (Lord Shiva).
'51': >-
  Thus sunk in anxious thought, having not found her, with his self encompassed
  by brooding sorrow, the vanara reflected.
'52': >-
  So long as I do not see Sita, Rama’s wife, the illustrious lady, so long will
  I search this city of Lanka again and again.
'53': >-
  And moreover, relying on Sampati’s words, if I bring Rama here while he does
  not behold his wife, Raghava would burn all the vanaras to ashes.
'54': >-
  Here itself, with regulated food, with senses restrained, I shall dwell—so
  that on my account all those men and vanaras may not perish.
'55': >-
  And this great Ashoka grove, with its vast trees—I shall reach it; for it has
  not yet been searched by me.
'56': >-
  Having bowed to the Vasus, the Rudras, and the Adityas, to the Ashvins and the
  Maruts also, I shall go forth, a bringer of grief to the rakshasas.
'57': >-
  Having conquered the rakshasas and obtained the देवी—she who is the joy of the
  Ikshvaku race—I shall deliver her to Rama, like a siddhi (spiritual
  attainment) to an ascetic.
'58': >-
  Having contemplated as it were for a moment, his senses disturbed by anxiety,
  the mighty-armed Hanuman, son of the Wind, arose.
'59': >-
  Salutations to Rama together with Lakshmana, and salutations to that divine
  Janaka’s daughter; salutations to Rudra, Indra, Yama, and Anila (the Wind);
  and salutations to the hosts of the Moon, Fire, and the Maruts.
'60': >-
  Having bowed to them, and also to Sugriva, Maruti looked upon all the
  directions and set forth toward the Ashoka grove.
'61': >-
  Going first in his mind to that auspicious Ashoka grove, the vanara, son of
  the Wind, pondered further on what was to be done next.
'62': >-
  Surely that sacred Ashoka grove will be crowded with rakshasas, thick with
  trees, and fully arranged with every preparation and refinement.
'63': >-
  And guards have certainly been stationed there, protecting the trees; even the
  Blessed Lord, the Soul of the universe, does not cause an excessive wind to
  blow there (so carefully is it protected).
'64': >-
  In this matter my very self has been staked—both for Rama’s purpose and
  against Ravana’s. May all the gods together with the hosts of rishis here
  grant me success.
'65': >-
  May Brahma, the Self-born Blessed Lord, and the gods who are ascetics; may
  Agni and Vayu; may Puruhuta (Indra), the wielder of the thunderbolt—grant me
  success.
'66': >-
  May Varuna, holding the noose in his hand; and Soma and Aditya likewise; and
  the great-souled Ashvins; and all the Maruts—grant me success.
'67': >-
  May all beings grant me success, and also He who is the Lord of beings; and
  even those others, unseen, who move upon the path and range of the earth—may
  they grant me success.
'68': >-
  When indeed shall I behold that noble face—high-nosed, with pale teeth,
  unblemished, with a pure smile, lotus-leaf eyes—having a splendor like the
  lord of the stars (the moon), serene and radiant?
'69': >-
  Overpowered by strength, though herself without strength; a chaste, suffering
  lady—how indeed could she today come within my sight, seized by that mean,
  base, cruel-hearted one, wearing a most dreadful, ornamented guise?
'70': >-
  Thus ends the thirteenth sarga, named “Hanuman’s Despondency,” in the Sundara
  Kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the primeval epic.
