  Now, in the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  thirty-sixth chapter, called “The Awakening (Admonition) by Siddhārtha.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon the Ikṣvāku king (Daśaratha), crushed by that promise (boon) here,
  and with tears, heaving deep sighs, spoke these words again to Sumantra:
'2': >-
  “O Sūta (charioteer-minister), let the army—abounding in excellent treasures
  and complete with the fourfold forces—be swiftly made ready for Rāghava’s
  onward journey.”
'3': >-
  “Let actors and singing women, and merchants possessed of great wealth, adorn
  the well-extended columns of troops of the prince.”
'4': >-
  “And those who depend upon him for their livelihood, and those with whom he
  takes delight by his prowess—having given them gifts of many kinds, appoint
  them also here (to accompany him).”
'5': >-
  “Let the foremost weapons and the citizens’ wagons as well follow Kakutstha;
  and let hunters skilled in woodland ways accompany him too.”
'6': >-
  “Slaying deer and elephants, and drinking forest-honey, and beholding various
  rivers—he will not remember the kingdom.”
'7': >-
  “Whatever grain-treasury and whatever money-treasury are mine—let those two
  follow Rāma, even though he dwell in a lonely forest.”
'8': >-
  “Performing sacrifices in holy places, and distributing the sacrificial fees
  in full, and meeting with ṛṣis as well—he will live happily in the forest.”
'9': >-
  “And mighty-armed Bharata will protect Ayodhyā. Thus let the illustrious Rāma
  be furnished again with every desired comfort (even in exile).”
'10': >-
  As Kakutstha (Daśaratha) spoke thus, fear came upon Kaikeyī; her face grew
  parched, and her voice too was choked.
'11': >-
  Dejected and terrified, her face drying up, Kaikeyī, facing the king himself,
  spoke these words:
'12': >-
  “O worthy sir, a kingdom whose wealth is gone is like liquor whose froth has
  been drunk off—utterly tasteless, empty; Bharata will not accept it.”
'13': >-
  While Kaikeyī, having cast off shame, was speaking exceedingly harshly, King
  Daśaratha spoke to that large-eyed lady:
'14': >-
  “Why do you strike at me, who bear the burden (of kingship), having yoked me
  to the yoke, O earth-renowned one? O ignoble woman—having begun this act, why
  did you not restrain it earlier?”
'15': >-
  Hearing that speech of his, joined with wrath, the fair-limbed lady Kaikeyī,
  angered twofold, spoke to the king thus:
'16': >-
  “In your very lineage, Sagara restrained (banished) his eldest son, famed as
  Asamañja; so this one (Rāma) too deserves to go.”
'17': >-
  Thus addressed, the king Daśaratha said only, “Shame! Fie!” and all the people
  were abashed; but she did not comprehend that.
'18': >-
  Then there, an aged high minister, known by name as Siddhārtha—pure (in
  conduct) and greatly esteemed by the king—spoke this to Kaikeyī:
'19': >-
  “Asamañja, seizing children who were playing on the road, delighted in casting
  them into the waters of the Sarayū; by that he was of wicked mind.”
'20': >-
  “Seeing that, all the citizens, angry, said to the king: ‘Choose Asamañja
  alone (and keep him), or choose us—O increaser of the realm.’”
'21': >-
  “Then the king said to them: ‘For what reason is this fear?’ And when
  questioned by the king, the people spoke these words.”
'22': >-
  “‘This one, while our sons—mere children—are playing, with a mind deranged,
  throws them into the Sarayū out of folly, and takes immeasurable delight (in
  it).’”
'23': >-
  Hearing the words of the citizens, the lord of men cast away that harmful son,
  wishing to do what was pleasing to them.
'24': >-
  Mounting him quickly upon a conveyance, together with his wife and all his
  belongings, the father commanded them: “This one is to be banished for life.”
'25': >-
  Taking a basket of fruits, he looked toward mountain-forts, roaming through
  all directions—like one who has committed sinful deeds.
'26': >-
  “Thus did King Sagara, truly righteous, abandon him. What sin did Rāma commit,
  by which he is restrained in this manner?”
'27': >-
  “For we do not see any fault in Rāghava at all. A blemish in him is as hard to
  find as a stain in the moon.”
'28': >-
  “Or else, O देवी, if you see some दोष in Rāghava, then today speak it
  truthfully; only then is Rāma to be banished.”
'29': >-
  “For abandoning one who is faultless, and who is devoted to the true
  path—being opposed to dharma—would burn even the radiance of Śakra (Indra).”
'30': >-
  “Therefore, enough, O देवी, of your striking down Rāma’s prosperity. And your
  slander is to be guarded against, even before the world, O fair-faced lady.”
'31': >-
  But having heard Siddhārtha’s words, the king—his voice grown yet more
  weary—addressed Kaikeyī with speech overpowered by grief:
'32': >-
  “You do not desire this counsel; O sinful-looking one, you do not understand
  what is good for my very self. Clinging to a wretched path and to vile
  conduct—your actions indeed have strayed away from the path of the righteous.”
'33': >-
  “Today I shall follow after Rāma, abandoning kingdom, comfort, and wealth. And
  you, together with all—along with King Bharata—enjoy the kingdom as you
  please, for a long time.”
'34': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-sixth chapter of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “The Awakening (Admonition) by
  Siddhārtha.”
