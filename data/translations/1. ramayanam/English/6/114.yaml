  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-fourteenth sarga, entitled “Mandodarī’s Lament.”
'1': >-
  As those rākṣasa women were wailing thus, the eldest wife, the beloved
  queen—pitiable and stricken—looked upon her lord.
'2': >-
  Seeing Daśagrīva slain by Rāma of inconceivable deeds, Mandodarī, wretched
  with grief, there bewailed her husband.
'3': >-
  “Is it not so, O mighty-armed one, younger brother of Vaiśravaṇa, that even
  Purandara himself trembles to stand before you when you are enraged?
'4': >-
  “Is it not so that even great seers, and illustrious Gandharvas, and the
  Cāraṇas, through fear of your agitation, have fled to the quarters?
'5': >-
  “Yet you—defeated in battle by Rāma, a mere man—are you not ashamed, O king, O
  lord of the rākṣasas? What is this?
'6': >-
  “How could a man, a forest-dweller, slay you—who had overrun the three worlds
  and were endowed with prosperity and valor, irresistible to all?”
'7': >-
  “For you, a shape-shifter, moving in regions beyond the reach of men,
  destruction at the hands of Rāma in battle does not seem fitting.
'8': >-
  “Nor, in the face of the army, can I credit this deed of Rāma—that he could
  assail you when you were surrounded on every side.”
'9': >-
  “Or else, in the form of Rāma, Death itself has come—contriving, for your
  destruction, an illusion beyond all imagining.
'10': >-
  “Or else you have been violated by Vāsava, O mighty one; yet what power has
  Vāsava even to look upon you in battle?
'11': >-
  “Clearly this is that great Yogin, the eternal Supreme Self—of immense
  strength and valor, of great splendor, the foe of the gods.
'12': >-
  “Beginningless, middleless, and endless; greater than the great; higher than
  darkness; the Creator—bearing conch, discus, and mace.
'13': >-
  “With Śrīvatsa upon his chest, ever possessed of Śrī, unconquerable,
  everlasting, steadfast—Viṣṇu, of true prowess, has assumed a human form.
'14': >-
  “Surrounded by all the gods who have taken on the state of vānaras, that
  blessed Lord of all worlds has come, desiring the welfare of the worlds.
'15': >-
  “You—who formerly subdued your senses, who conquered the three worlds,
  terrifying to the gods, with a retinue of rākṣasas—(now lie slain by Him).”
'16': >-
  “As though conquered by those very senses that kept recalling that
  hostility—when, indeed, at Janasthāna, Rāma was surrounded by many rākṣasas—”
'17': >-
  “—and Khara, your brother, was slain—then Rāma was no mere man; and when
  Hanumān, by valor, entered the city of Laṅkā, hard to penetrate even for the
  gods,”
'18': “then we were shaken; and I said, ‘Let there be no enmity with Rāghava.’”
'19': >-
  “Though thus admonished, you would not accept it; and this dawn has come upon
  you. And, rākṣasa bull, you suddenly became desirous of Sītā.
'20': >-
  “For the ruin of your sovereignty, of your body, and of your own kin—O
  evil-minded one—you lusted after her, excelling Arundhatī and even Rohiṇī.
'21': >-
  “By assailing revered Sītā, you did a deed unworthy of you—she who is Earth’s
  very earth, Śrī’s very Śrī, devoted to her husband.
'22': >-
  “Bringing that auspicious lady, flawless in every limb, into the lonely
  wilderness—then carrying her off, wretched, by deceit—you stained your own
  good name.
'23': >-
  “And not attaining that desire, the union with the Maithilī, you have surely
  been burnt by the austerity of that devoted wife, my lord.
'24': >-
  “That you were not burnt at once while violating that slender-waisted lady—(it
  is only because) all the gods, with Indra, with Agni at their head, were
  afraid of you.
'25': >-
  “Surely one obtains the fruit of sinful action; when the time has come for the
  doer, there is no doubt of it.
'26': >-
  “He who does good attains good; he who does evil partakes of evil. Vibhīṣaṇa
  has obtained happiness; you have obtained such sin as this.
'27': >-
  “There are other women for you, more excellent in beauty than she; but having
  fallen under the sway of desire, you, deluded, did not understand.
'28': >-
  “Neither by lineage, nor by beauty, nor by graciousness is Maithilī superior
  to me or even equal to me—yet, deluded, you did not perceive it.
'29': >-
  “For all beings, death never comes without a sign; and for you, that death had
  as its unmistakable sign the Maithilī.
'30': >-
  “The death born of Sītā as its cause was brought near by you from afar;
  Maithilī, with Rāma, will live and sport free from sorrow.
'31': >-
  “I, of little merit, have fallen into a dreadful ocean of grief—(I who once
  moved) on Kailāsa, on Mandara, on Meru, and in the Caitraratha grove,
'32': >-
  “having roamed in every divine garden together with you, in a fitting aerial
  car—possessed of incomparable splendor.
'33': >-
  “Beholding many lands, adorned with wondrous garlands and garments—now I am
  cast down from pleasures of desire, O hero, by your death.
'34': >-
  “I have become altogether another; alas, the fickle fortune of kings! O king,
  alas—your tender face: beautiful-browed, fair-skinned, with a high nose,
'35': >-
  “equal in luster, prosperity, and radiance to the moon, the lotus, and the
  sun—crowned with a diadem’s brilliance, copper-hued in countenance, with
  shining earrings,
'36': >-
  “with rolling eyes unsteady from intoxication when you were in the halls of
  drinking; wearing diverse garlands; lovely—how was your charming smile and
  speech once auspicious!
'37': >-
  “That same face of yours does not shine today, my lord—pierced by Rāma’s
  arrows, red with streams of blood.
'38': >-
  “Its fat and brain shattered, rough with the dust of chariots—ah, my final
  state has come, the state that bestows widowhood.
'39': >-
  “I, foolish, never understood this at any time—that my father is the king of
  Dānavas, and my husband the lord of rākṣasas,
'40': >-
  “and my son the conqueror of Śakra—thus I was exceedingly proud. Cruel,
  arrogant, crushers of foes, famed for strength and manliness,
'41': >-
  “I held this firm thought: ‘My protectors are fearless from any quarter.’ How
  then has this fear, never imagined, come from a mere man, to you rākṣasa bulls
  of such might?
'42': “That vast body—dark like glossy indranīla, lofty and great like a mountain—
'43': >-
  “shining with armlets and bracelets, vaidūrya gems, pearl necklaces and
  garlands—beautiful in sports, blazing on the battlefield—
'44': >-
  “which used to gleam with the radiance of ornaments like a cloud lit by
  lightning—that same body of yours today is covered with countless sharp
  arrows.
'45': >-
  “It is again beyond reach and touch; it cannot be embraced—like a porcupine
  bristling everywhere with arrows stuck fast without break.
'46': >-
  “With vital spots cruelly struck, sinew-bonds cut apart—fallen on the earth, O
  king, dark-hued, with the sheen of blood.
'47': >-
  “Like a mountain shattered by a thunderbolt’s stroke—ah, is this a dream made
  real: how were you slain by Rāma?
'48': >-
  “You would be death even to Death—how have you fallen under Death’s power? You
  who consumed the treasures of the three worlds, who caused great dread to the
  three worlds—
'49': >-
  “the conqueror of the guardians of the worlds, the one who cast down even
  Śaṅkara; the chastiser of the proud; whose valor was made manifest—
'50': >-
  “the agitator of the worlds, the destroyer of the good; the speaker of proud
  words, with might, in the very presence of foes—
'51': >-
  “the protector of your own hosts and servants, the slayer of men of dreadful
  deeds; the slayer of Dānava lords and of thousands of Yakṣas—
'52': >-
  “the subduer in battle of the Nivātakavacas; the despoiler of many sacrifices;
  and the rescuer of your own people—
'53': >-
  “the breaker of the order of dharma, the creator of illusions in war; the
  abductor, here and there, of daughters of gods, asuras, and men—
'54': >-
  “the giver of sorrow to enemies’ wives, and the leader of your own folk; the
  guardian of the island of Laṅkā, the doer of terrible deeds—
'55': >-
  “the giver to us of pleasures of desire, the foremost of charioteers—seeing
  such a mighty lord felled by Rāma—
'56': >-
  “how do I yet remain firm and bear this body, robbed of my beloved—O lord of
  rākṣasas, who used to lie on most precious couches?
'57': >-
  “Why do you sleep here upon the ground, covered in dust, my lord—when my son
  Indrajit, wounded by Lakṣmaṇa in battle—
'58': >-
  “then I was struck down with sharp anguish; and today I have fallen into this.
  I, bereft of kinsmen, and bereft of you, my protector—
'59': >-
  “deprived of pleasures of desire, shall grieve for endless years. O king, you
  have set forth today on a long road, very hard to traverse.
'60': >-
  “Lead me too, afflicted by sorrow; I shall not live without you. Why, leaving
  me here helpless, do you wish to go?
'61': >-
  “To me, helpless, wailing, foolish—why do you not speak? Seeing me here,
  unveiled, have you not even become angry?
'62': >-
  “I have come out from the city gate, coming on foot, my lord. Behold your
  beloved wives—fallen outside, their veils of modesty cast away.
'63': >-
  “How do you not rage on seeing them all flung out? This person, your
  play-companion, is lamented as bereft of a master.
'64': >-
  “Yet you do not console them—why do you not even honor them? O king, by you
  many women of noble families have been made widows—
'65': >-
  “women devoted to their husbands, intent on dharma, devoted to service of
  elders. By those women, scorched by grief, you were cursed and brought under
  another’s power.
'66': >-
  “Cursed by those whom you wronged—thus has it come to pass. This saying, O
  king, is indeed true in your case, for the most part:
'67': >-
  “Never do the tears of devoted wives fall upon the earth without cause. And
  how, O king—you who once overran the worlds by your splendor—
'68': >-
  “did you commit this petty ‘theft of a woman,’ thinking it heroism: drawing
  Rāma away from the hermitage by the guise of a deer?
'69': >-
  “Rāma’s wife was brought here after removing Lakṣmaṇa; yet I do not recall
  cowardice in you in battle at any time.
'70': >-
  “But through a reversal of fortune, surely your doom had ripened. You who knew
  the meanings of past and future, who were discerning about the present—
'71': >-
  “when I saw Maithilī brought here, I reflected and sighed deeply; and then my
  brother-in-law, that mighty-armed one, a speaker of truth, said to me—
'72': >-
  ‘This destruction of the foremost rākṣasas has come near—arising from calamity
  born of desire and wrath, and clung to through attachment.’
'73': >-
  ‘The gain you sought has ceased; this great disaster uproots the very root. By
  you has all this been done—this rākṣasa clan made masterless.’
'74': >-
  “You are not to be lamented by me, famed for strength and manliness; yet my
  mind, through a woman’s nature, turns toward compassion.
'75': >-
  “Taking with you both good deeds and evil deeds, you have gone to your own
  destiny. I lament myself—made miserable by your destruction.
'76': >-
  “You did not listen to the words of well-wishers, your friends who desired
  your good; nor, wholly, to the beneficial counsel spoken by your brothers, O
  Daśānana.
'77': >-
  “What Vibhīṣaṇa said—reasonable, purposeful, properly spoken, conducive to
  your welfare, and not harsh—you did not do, though full of sound reason.
'78': >-
  “The words of Mārīca and Kumbhakarṇa, and likewise of my father—you,
  intoxicated with valor, did not follow; this is its such-like fruit.
'79': >-
  “O you whose hue is like a dark rain-cloud, with yellow garments and
  auspicious armlets—having cast down your own limbs, why do you lie covered in
  blood?
'80': >-
  “As though asleep—why do you not answer me, distressed with grief? O man of
  great valor, skilled, never fleeing in battles—
'81': >-
  “why do you not answer me, granddaughter of a yātudhāna? Rise, rise—why do you
  lie while a fresh humiliation has been wrought?
'82': >-
  “Today, indeed, the sun’s rays have entered Laṅkā without fear—you by whose
  sunlike radiance you used to scorch enemies in battle.
'83': >-
  “This is that ever-honored vajra-like weapon of yours, as of the
  vajra-bearer—used for many blows in war, adorned with a net-work of gold—
'84': >-
  “your iron club, shattered into a thousand pieces by arrows. Embracing the
  earth of the battlefield as though she were your beloved—why do you lie?
'85': >-
  “Why do you not wish to speak to me, as though I were displeasing? Shame on
  the heart of me, whose heart is not split into a thousand pieces!
'86': >-
  “When you have reached the state of the five elements, this sorrow that
  torments me bears fruit.” Thus lamenting, her eyes confused with tears—
'87': >-
  “her heart overflowing with affection—she then fell into delusion; struck by
  anguish, fainting, she lay upon Rāvaṇa’s chest.
'88': >-
  Like a lightning-flash blazing in a cloud tinged with twilight, the co-wives,
  greatly afflicted, raised her thus fallen—
'89': >-
  and, themselves weeping, they set her down and sought to steady her as she
  wailed intensely, saying: “O queen, do you not know the instability of worldly
  conditions?
'90': >-
  “In the alternation of states, the fortunes of kings are indeed unsteady.”
  Thus addressed, she cried aloud again and again.
'91': >-
  Bathing her breasts and her pure face with tears, in the meanwhile Rāma spoke
  to Vibhīṣaṇa:
'92': >-
  “Let the funeral rites for your brother be performed; and let the women’s
  company be consoled.” Then the wise Vibhīṣaṇa spoke these words:
'93': >-
  Having reflected with his understanding, speaking humbly what was beneficial,
  in accordance with dharma and artha: “He abandoned dharma and sacred vows; he
  was cruel, pitiless, and untruthful—
'94': >-
  “I am not fit to perform rites for one who violated others’ wives. In the
  guise of a brother he was my enemy, ever intent on the harm of all.
'95': >-
  “Rāvaṇa does not deserve honor, though (as) a guru he is worthy of reverence;
  (if I do so,) people on earth will call me ‘pitiless,’ O Rāma.
'96': >-
  “Hearing all his faults, everyone will, in turn, praise my good deed.” Hearing
  this, Rāma—the best among uphold­ers of dharma—was exceedingly pleased.
'97': >-
  That master of speech, understanding words and skilled in reply, said this to
  Vibhīṣaṇa: “You too must do what is dear to me. By your influence I have won.
'98': >-
  “Yet it is surely proper that I speak: this rākṣasa king—though joined with
  adharma and untruth—was radiant, strong, and heroic,
'99': >-
  “and ever in battles it is heard that he was not defeated by the gods with
  Śatakratu at their head.
'100': >-
  “Great-souled and endowed with strength, Rāvaṇa—of whom the world spoke—(is
  slain). Enmities end in death; our purpose is accomplished.
'101': >-
  “Let his rites be performed, as for me also, just as for you. From your hand,
  O mighty-armed one, let the rites be done according to ordinance.
'102': >-
  “Swiftly, by dharma, you shall become a sharer in fame.” Hearing Rāghava’s
  words, Vibhīṣaṇa hastened—
'103': >-
  and began to perform the last rites for his slain brother, Rāvaṇa. Entering
  the city of Laṅkā, Vibhīṣaṇa, lord of rākṣasas—
'104': >-
  quickly had Rāvaṇa’s sacred fires brought out, along with carts of firewood,
  and the priests as well.
'105': >-
  And sandalwood logs, and various other woods; and fragrant aloe-wood; and
  perfumes of sweet scent—
'106': >-
  and gems, pearls, and corals—the rākṣasa brought out. In a short while he
  returned, surrounded by rākṣasas.
'107': >-
  Then, together with Mālyavat, he performed the rites. Setting (the body) upon
  a divine golden bier, clothed in linen—
'108': >-
  with brahmins—faces pale with tears—acclaiming the rākṣasa lord Rāvaṇa with
  diverse sounds of instruments and praises and benedictions—
'109': >-
  and with the bier adorned with variegated banners and strewn with flowers,
  those led by Vibhīṣaṇa lifted it up.
'110': >-
  All, facing south, bearing the wood, went forth. Those fires, blazing, were
  kindled there by the priests officiating at the sacrifice.
'111': >-
  All those of the inner apartments—having sought refuge—went swiftly in front
  of him, weeping.
'112': >-
  Those women followed behind, tottering on every side; and placing Rāvaṇa in
  the prepared place, they stood in extreme grief.
'113': >-
  They arranged the funeral pyre with sandalwood and with padmaka, uśīra, and
  sandal—covered with a spread of woolen blankets—according to brahminical
  ordinance.
'114': >-
  They performed for the rākṣasa king the unsurpassed ancestral funeral rite;
  and the altar facing south and east, and the fire in its proper place.
'115': >-
  They set upon the shoulder a ladle filled with ghee; at the feet they placed
  the cart; and at the thighs, then, the mortar.
'116': >-
  All wooden vessels, and the lower and upper fire-sticks (araṇis), and also
  another pestle—having been given—they arranged each in its proper place.
'117': >-
  By the procedure seen in the śāstras and enjoined by the great seers, the
  rākṣasas there slew the sacrificial animal for the rākṣasa king.
'118': >-
  They placed the king’s ceremonial bedding, anointed with ghee; and adorning
  Rāvaṇa with perfumes and garlands, their hearts cast down—
'119': >-
  with Vibhīṣaṇa assisting, and with various cloths as well—they scattered
  parched grains, their faces filled with tears.
'120': >-
  Then Vibhīṣaṇa, following the rite, consigned him to the fire; and, having
  bathed, with wet garments he offered sesame mixed with kuśa-grass—
'121': >-
  mixed with water, giving it according to ordinance. He repeatedly conciliated
  and comforted those women.
'122': >-
  “Go,” he said; and all of them then entered the city. When the women had
  entered the city, Vibhīṣaṇa, lord of rākṣasas, approached Rāma’s side and
  stood respectfully.
'123': >-
  Rāma too, with his army—together with Sugrīva and with Lakṣmaṇa—rejoiced at
  having slain the foe, as the wielder of the thunderbolt (rejoiced) after
  slaying Vṛtra.
'124': >-
  Then, unfastening and laying aside his bow with its arrows, and doffing that
  great cuirass bestowed by Mahendra, he released his wrath after subduing the
  enemy; and Rāma, the slayer of foes, returned to his gentle nature.
'125': >-
  Thus ends, in the ancient seers’ Rāmāyaṇa—the revered Vālmīki’s Ādikāvya—in
  the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the one-hundred-and-fourteenth sarga, entitled “Mandodarī’s
  Lament.”
