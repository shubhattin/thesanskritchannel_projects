  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa, the sixty-seventh
  chapter, called “The Repetition of Sītā’s Words (as a Message).”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by the great-souled Rāghava (Rāma), Hanumān reported to Rāghava
  in full all that Sītā had spoken.
'2': >-
  “O bull among men, the goddess Jānakī spoke this to me—an identifying
  recollection of what had formerly occurred at Citrakūṭa, exactly as it
  happened.
'3': >-
  ‘Earlier, while asleep in comfort together with you, Jānakī awoke; then a crow
  suddenly swooped down and tore the space between my breasts.
'4': >-
  ‘And in turn you too were asleep, O elder brother of Bharata, upon the lady’s
  lap; then that bird again caused the lady pain, so it is said.
'5': >-
  ‘Then, coming back once more, it indeed tore her severely; and then you were
  awakened, smeared with her blood.
'6': >-
  ‘Thus, while she was continually tormented by that crow, you were awakened by
  the lady—though you had been sleeping pleasantly, O scorcher of foes.
'7': >-
  ‘Seeing her, O mighty-armed one, and seeing that she had been torn between the
  breasts, you became enraged like a furious venomous serpent and then spoke
  these words:
'8': >-
  “By whose sharp nail-tips, O timid one, has the space between your breasts
  been torn? Who sports in wrath with a five-mouthed serpent?”
'9': >-
  ‘Looking about suddenly, you beheld that crow, standing facing her, with sharp
  talons stained with blood.
'10': >-
  ‘That crow, the best among birds, was said to be the son of Śakra (Indra);
  and, swiftly entering the clefts of the earth, it was equal to the wind in
  speed.
'11': >-
  ‘Then, O mighty-armed one, with your eyes turned by anger, you formed a
  dreadful resolve against that crow—O best among the wise.
'12': >-
  ‘Taking up a blade of darbha grass from a spread of darbha, you charged it
  with the Brahmā-weapon; blazing like the fire at the end of time, it flared
  forth toward the bird.
'13': >-
  ‘You hurled that flaming darbha at the crow; and then that blazing darbha
  pursued the crow.
'14': >-
  ‘Abandoned by all the gods in fear, the crow circled through the three worlds,
  yet found no protector.
'15': >-
  ‘Then it returned again there, to you, O subduer of foes; and you—who are a
  refuge—saw it fallen upon the ground, come seeking shelter.
'16': >-
  ‘Though it deserved to be slain, O Kākutstha, you protected it out of
  compassion; for, O Rāghava, the weapon could not be made futile.”
'17': >-
  ‘And you destroyed the crow’s right eye. Then, Rāma, that crow bowed to you,
  and also to King Daśaratha.
'18': >-
  ‘Dismissed then, the crow returned to its own abode. Thus are you the foremost
  among those who know celestial weapons—mighty in spirit and possessed of noble
  conduct as well.
'19': >-
  ‘For what reason, O Rāghava, do you not employ your weapon upon the rākṣasas?
  Neither Dānavas, nor Gandharvas, nor Asuras, nor hosts of Maruts,
'20': >-
  ‘are able to withstand you in battle, O Rāma. If one so potent in valor can
  feel any agitation concerning me—if such concern exists—
'21': >-
  ‘let Rāvaṇa quickly be struck down in war with keen-edged arrows—either by
  Lakṣmaṇa, O scorcher of foes, upon learning his brother’s command.
'22': >-
  ‘Then why does Rāghava, the best among men, not protect me? Those two
  tiger-like men are able; their radiance is like wind and fire.
'23': >-
  ‘Even to the gods they are hard to assail—why then do they neglect me? Surely
  some great evil deed of mine exists; of this there is no doubt.
'24': >-
  ‘Since those two scorchers of foes, though capable and united, do not protect
  me…’ Hearing the pitiable and well-spoken words of Vaidehī,
'25': >-
  I again spoke this word to that noble lady: “Rāma is free from sorrow on your
  account, O देवी; by truth itself I swear to you.
'26': >-
  When Rāma is overcome by grief, Lakṣmaṇa too is afflicted. You have somehow
  been seen by me—this is no time for lamentation.
'27': >-
  This very moment, O fair lady, you shall behold the end of your sorrows. Those
  two royal princes, tiger-like among men, scorcher of foes,
'28': >-
  made eager by the sight of you, will reduce Laṅkā to ashes; and, having slain
  in battle the fierce Rāvaṇa together with his kinsmen,
'29': >-
  Rāghava will surely lead you, O woman of lovely hips, back to his own city.
  Yet, O blameless one, so that Rāma may recognize an identifying token,
'30': something that brings him joy—you ought to give that, to present to him.
'31': >-
  Then, looking in all directions, she unfastened her excellent braid; and from
  within her cloth she gave me this jewel, O mighty one. I received the jewel
  with both arms—for your sake, O beloved of the Raghu line.
'32': >-
  Bowing my head to her, I hastened to depart; and that fair-complexioned lady,
  seeing me eager to go,
'33': >-
  indeed addressed me—Jānaka’s daughter—her face filled with tears, wretched,
  speaking in a voice choked with sobs:
'34': >-
  Sītā, distressed by the shock at my taking flight, and struck by the force of
  grief, then said to me: “Fortunate are you, great monkey,
'35': >-
  in that you will behold the mighty-armed Rāma, lotus-eyed, and also
  mighty-armed Lakṣmaṇa—my renowned brother-in-law.
'36': >-
  Though thus spoken to by Sītā, I replied to Maithilī likewise: “Mount upon my
  back, O lady—quickly, O joy of Janaka,
'37': >-
  so that today I may show you Sugrīva together with Lakṣmaṇa, and also Rāghava,
  O greatly blessed one, your husband, O dark-eyed lady.”
'38': >-
  Then the goddess said to me: “This is not dharma, O great monkey, that I
  should ride upon your back by my own will, O foremost of monkeys.
'39': >-
  Formerly too, O hero, my limbs were touched by a rākṣasa; what could I do
  then, being oppressed by time and circumstance?
'40': >-
  “Go, O tiger among monkeys, to where the two sons of the king are.” Speaking
  thus, she then set herself again to send a message.
'41': >-
  “Hanumān, to those two—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—who are like lions, and also to
  Sugrīva together with his ministers—to all of them you should convey my
  freedom from illness.
'42': >-
  “And in what manner that mighty-armed Rāghava will deliver me from this
  barrier, this enclosure of the ocean of sorrow—this too you are fit to relate.
'43': >-
  “And this—my intense surge of grief, and the insults hurled by these
  rākṣasas—having gone near to Rāma, you should tell him. May your journey be
  auspicious, O hero among monkeys.”
'44': >-
  Such were the words that the noble, self-controlled Sītā spoke—tinged with
  despondency—to you, O king. Knowing this message exactly as spoken, you should
  place faith in Sītā—that she is well in her whole being.
'45': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-seventh chapter of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the revered
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Repetition of Sītā’s Words (as a
  Message).”
