  holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Uttara-Kanda.

  There, when that night had passed, Raghu’s joy (Lakshmana) rose again at dawn
  and then set forth.
'2': >-
  Then, when half the day had elapsed, that great warrior entered Ayodhya—filled
  with treasures and gems, thronged about by people who were glad and
  well-nourished.
'3': >-
  But Saumitri, though of very great understanding, fell into extreme dejection,
  thinking, “Having reached Rama’s feet, what indeed shall I say of what has
  happened?”
'4': >-
  While he thus pondered, there appeared before him the exceedingly noble palace
  of Rama, shining like the moon.
'5': >-
  At the door of the king’s palace, he descended from his excellent chariot and,
  with face cast down and mind distressed, entered unrestrained.
'6': >-
  He beheld Raghava seated sorrowfully upon the supreme seat; and with both eyes
  filled with tears he looked upon his elder brother before him.
'7': >-
  Lakshmana, his heart afflicted, clasped his feet; and, with hands joined in
  reverence and composed, he spoke in a sorrowful voice:
'8': >-
  “Acting in obedience to my noble lord’s command, I abandoned Janaka’s daughter
  at the bank of the Ganga, as directed, at the pure hermitage of Valmiki.
'9': >-
  “Having left there that illustrious lady of auspicious conduct at the edge of
  the hermitage, O hero, I have come back again to attend upon your feet.”
'10': >-
  “Grieve not, O tiger among men; such indeed is the course of Time. Men like
  you—wise and steadfast—do not lament.”
'11': >-
  “All accumulations end in destruction; all elevations end in a fall. All
  unions end in separation; and life itself ends in death.”
'12': >-
  “Therefore, with sons, with wives, with friends, and with riches, one should
  not form excessive attachment; for separation from them is surely inevitable.”
'13': >-
  “You are able, by your very self, to govern yourself by your mind alone, O
  Kakutstha—and even all the worlds besides; how much more, then, your own
  sorrow?”
'14': >-
  “Men like you, bulls among men, do not become deluded in such matters. That
  slander concerning you, O Raghava, will again return upon those who utter it.”
'15': >-
  “For the sake of which Maithili was abandoned—through fear of reproach—that
  very reproach, O king, will arise in the city, O ruler, without doubt.”
'16': >-
  “Therefore you, O lion among men, firmly composed in fortitude, abandon this
  feeble notion; do not give way to anguish.”
'17': >-
  Thus addressed by Lakshmana, the great-souled Kakutstha—affectionate to his
  friends—spoke to Saumitri with the highest delight:
'18': >-
  “So indeed it is, O best of men, just as you say, Lakshmana. And, O hero, I am
  pleased with your guidance in my duty.”
'19': >-
  “Calm has returned to me, O gentle one, and my anguish has been dispelled. By
  your words—fair and soothing—I have been comforted, Lakshmana.”
'20': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-second chapter, called “The Consolation of Rama,” in the
  sacred Valmiki Ramayana, the Adi-Kavya, in the Uttara-Kanda.
