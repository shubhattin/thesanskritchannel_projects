  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-seventh chapter, named “The Sight of the King of Vultures (Jaṭāyu).”
'1': >-
  Though he was the elder, Rāghava (Rāma), grasping what was essential, accepted
  as most weighty the well-spoken words that Lakṣmaṇa had merely uttered.
'2': >-
  The mighty-armed Rāma, restraining the swelling wrath within himself, and
  gripping his wondrous bow firmly, spoke to Lakṣmaṇa.
'3': >-
  “What shall we do, dear child? Where shall we go, Lakṣmaṇa? By what means
  shall we behold Sītā? Consider this here.”
'4': >-
  To him, thus tormented by burning anguish, Lakṣmaṇa spoke these words: “This
  very Janasthāna is what you must search.”
'5': >-
  “It is strewn with many rākṣasas, and filled with trees and creepers of
  various kinds; here are mountain-fastnesses, trackless places, and ravines as
  well.”
'6': >-
  “There are many dreadful caves, crowded with herds of diverse beasts, and also
  dwelling-places of Kinnaras and abodes of Gandharvas.”
'7': >-
  “Along with me, you should search them out. Great-souled lords among men,
  endowed with discernment such as yours—”
'8': >-
  “—do not tremble in calamities, like mountains unmoved by the speed of the
  winds.” Thus addressed, Rāma, with Lakṣmaṇa, ranged through that entire
  forest.
'9': >-
  Rāma, in anger, set upon his bow a terrible, sharp-edged arrow; then he beheld
  the most excellent of birds, most illustrious, like a mountain-peak in form.
'10': >-
  He saw Jaṭāyu fallen upon the ground, drenched with blood from his wounds.
  Seeing him, mountain-crag-like, Rāma said to Lakṣmaṇa:
'11': >-
  “By this one, Vaidehī Sītā has been eaten—of this there is no doubt. This
  clearly is a rākṣasa roaming the woodland in the form of a vulture.”
'12': >-
  “Having devoured the large-eyed one, he lies content, as he pleases. I shall
  slay him with blazing-pointed, terrible, unfaltering arrows.”
'13': >-
  Having spoken thus, the enraged Rāma rushed forward to see him, fitting the
  sharp arrow upon his bow, as though he were shaking the earth whose borders
  are the ocean.
'14': >-
  Then that bird addressed Rāma, son of Daśaratha, with a voice most pitiable,
  vomiting blood mingled with foam:
'15': >-
  “O long-lived one, the goddess whom you seek in this great forest—like a
  life-giving herb—she, and my very life-breath, both were carried off by
  Rāvaṇa.”
'16': >-
  “When the goddess was separated from you and from Lakṣmaṇa, O Rāghava, I saw
  her being borne away by the mighty Rāvaṇa.”
'17': >-
  “I confronted Rāvaṇa in battle, lord, for Sītā’s sake; and he, with chariot
  and parasol shattered, fell upon the earth.”
'18': >-
  “This is his bow, broken; and these are his arrows as well. Here, O Rāma, is
  his battle-chariot, broken in the fight.”
'19': >-
  “And this is his charioteer, struck down upon the ground by my wings. But
  Rāvaṇa, with a sword, cut off my wings, as I was exhausted.”
'20': >-
  “Taking Vaidehī Sītā, he leapt up into the sky. I, already struck down by the
  rākṣasa, you ought not to slay.”
'21': >-
  But Rāma, understanding from him that dear account bound up with Sītā, cast
  away his great bow and embraced the king of vultures.
'22': >-
  Overpowered, he fell upon the ground and wept, together with Lakṣmaṇa—Rāma,
  though steadfast by nature, now afflicted with grief twofold intensified.
'23': >-
  Seeing him in that grievous pass, sighing again and again, sunk in solitary
  distress, the sorrowing Rāma spoke this to Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa):
'24': >-
  “The kingdom is lost; there is dwelling in the forest; Sītā is lost; the
  twice-born bird is dying. Such misfortune of mine could burn even fire
  itself.”
'25': >-
  “Even if today I could completely cross the great ocean, surely, by my
  ill-luck, even the lord of rivers would be dried up.”
'26': >-
  “There is none in this world—moving and unmoving—more unfortunate than I, for
  by me has this vast snare of calamity been attained.”
'27': >-
  “This mighty king of vultures is my father’s friend of equal age; he lies
  slain upon the ground because my fortune has turned adverse.”
'28': >-
  Speaking thus again and again, Rāghava, with Lakṣmaṇa, touched Jaṭāyu, showing
  a fatherly affection.
'29': >-
  Embracing that king of vultures—his wings cut off and his body drenched in
  blood—Rāghava cried, “Where has Maithilī, equal to my very life, gone?” And,
  his voice failing, he fell to the ground.
'30': >-
  Thus ends, in the venerable, holy Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki—the first epic—in the
  Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the sixty-seventh chapter, named “The Sight of the King of
  Vultures.”
