  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa,
  begins the eighty-fifth canto, called “The Slaying of Vṛtra.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words of Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma—the subduer of foes—said to that
  noble-souled one of excellent vows: “Relate to me, in full and without
  omission, the account of the slaying of Vṛtra.”
'2': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāghava, Lakṣmaṇa—who ever increased the joy of
  Sumitrā—again narrated at length that divine account, being steadfast in his
  sacred observances.
'3': >-
  Having heard the words of the Thousand-eyed (Indra), and also of all the
  dwellers in heaven, Viṣṇu spoke these words to all the gods, with Indra at
  their head:
'4': >-
  “Formerly I was bound to that great-souled Vṛtra by ties of friendship;
  therefore, for the sake of what is dear to you, I do not myself slay that
  mighty Asura.
'5': >-
  “Yet your highest welfare and happiness must surely be brought about;
  therefore I shall declare the means by which Vṛtra may be slain.
'6': >-
  “O best of the Suras, I shall divide myself into three parts; by that, the
  Thousand-eyed will slay Vṛtra—of this there is no doubt.
'7': >-
  “Let one portion enter Vāsava (Indra); let the second become the thunderbolt
  itself; let the third enter the very earth. Then Śakra will slay Vṛtra.”
'8': >-
  When the Lord of the gods spoke thus, the gods then replied with these words:
  “So indeed it is—there is no doubt—just as you say, O slayer of Dānavas.
'9': >-
  “May auspiciousness be yours. We shall go, seeking the destruction of the
  Asura Vṛtra. O supremely generous one, strengthen Vāsava with your own
  radiance.”
'10': >-
  Thereupon all those great-souled gods, with the Thousand-eyed at their
  forefront, set forth toward that forest where the mighty Asura Vṛtra was.
'11': >-
  They beheld the foremost of Asuras, made formidable by his own fiery
  energy—burning with austerity as it were—drinking up, as though, the three
  worlds, and scorching, as though, the very sky.
'12': >-
  Seeing that chief of Asuras, the gods were seized with terror, thinking: “How
  shall we slay him? How shall there not be defeat?”
'13': >-
  While they were thus reflecting there, the Thousand-eyed Purandara took the
  thunderbolt in both hands and hurled it upon Vṛtra’s head.
'14': >-
  As that dread thunderbolt, blazing with great effulgence like the fire of Time
  at the world’s end, fell upon Vṛtra’s head, the universe was overwhelmed with
  fear.
'15': >-
  Indra, lord of the gods, deeming the slaying of Vṛtra to be something almost
  beyond belief, and pondering it, swiftly went to the far end of the world, he
  of great renown.
'16': >-
  And Brahmahatyā—the sin of slaying a brāhmaṇa—quickly pursued Indra as he
  fled; it fell upon his limbs, and great sorrow entered Indra.
'17': >-
  When the foe had been slain and Indra was lost (withdrawn in fear), the gods,
  with Agni at their head, again and again worshipped Viṣṇu, the Lord of the
  three worlds.
'18': >-
  “You are our refuge, O Supreme Lord; you are the first-born, the Father of the
  world. For the protection of all beings you have assumed the state of Viṣṇu
  (the all-pervading preserver).”
'19': >-
  “By you this Vṛtra has been slain; yet Brahmahatyā afflicts Vāsava. O tiger
  among the gods, declare the means for his release from that sin.”
'20': >-
  Hearing those words of the gods, Viṣṇu said: “Let Śakra sacrifice to Me; I
  shall purify the wielder of the thunderbolt.”
'21': >-
  “Having worshipped Me through the meritorious Horse-sacrifice (Aśvamedha),
  Pākaśāsana (Indra), freed from fear on every side, shall regain the lordship
  of Indrahood among the gods.”
'22': >-
  Having thus delivered to the gods that speech, nectar-like, Viṣṇu—the Lord of
  the gods—departed to Triviṣṭapa (heaven), being praised.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-fifth canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Slaying of Vṛtra.”
