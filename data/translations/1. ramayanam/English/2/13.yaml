  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  thirteenth canto, called “Daśaratha’s Lament.”
'1': >-
  Then he beheld the great king lying there—unworthy of that plight, and not in
  keeping with his station—like Yayāti, when, his merit exhausted, he had fallen
  down from the world of the gods.
'2': >-
  That lady—whose boons had taken the form of calamity, whose desired end was
  not truly achieved, who was fearless yet a revealer of fear—once again pressed
  upon him that very boon.
'3': >-
  “You boast, O great king, that you are a speaker of truth and steadfast in
  your vow; then why do you wish not to uphold this boon of mine?”
'4': >-
  Thus addressed by Kaikeyī, King Daśaratha then replied—angry, and as though
  reeling in bewilderment for a moment.
'5': >-
  “When I am dead, and when Rāma, the foremost of men, has gone to the
  forest—ah, O ignoble woman, my enemy—then, your desire fulfilled, be happy and
  live at ease!”
'6': >-
  “Even in heaven, the welfare of Rāma would surely be proclaimed to me by the
  gods at their command; but how, alas, shall I endure such words?”
'7': >-
  “If Rāma is exiled to the forest for the sake of Kaikeyī’s cherished desire—if
  I speak this as truth, then that truth itself will become untruth.”
'8': >-
  “Though I was without a son, with very great toil I obtained this great,
  mighty Rāma, possessed of great splendor; how can I cast him away?”
'9': >-
  “He is valiant and accomplished in learning, one who has conquered anger and
  is devoted to forbearance—how can I banish Rāma, lotus-petaled-eyed?”
'10': >-
  “How shall I set Rāma—dark as the blue lotus, long-armed, of great strength,
  and wholly charming—amid the Daṇḍaka forests?”
'11': >-
  “How could I behold suffering in the wise Rāma—he who is fit only for
  happiness, and to whom sorrows are utterly unfitting?”
'12': >-
  “If only my passing from this life could occur without causing him grief, then
  I might attain peace—since Rāma, who is undeserving of sorrow, would then
  obtain happiness.”
'13': >-
  “O ruthless one, whose resolve is sinful—Rāma’s valor is founded on truth;
  why, O Kaikeyī, by what is hateful, do you seek to join what is dear for me?”
'14': >-
  As he lamented thus, his mind whirling in confusion, matchless infamy in the
  world was certain to befall him.
'15': >-
  The sun went down, and night came on; and for that afflicted one, that night
  of three watches arrived, adorned by the orb of the moon.
'16': >-
  Yet the night did not seem to shine for the king as he wailed; the aged King
  Daśaratha kept ever breathing out hot sighs.
'17': >-
  With eyes fixed upon the sky, he lamented in anguish and grief: “I do not
  desire dawn, O night, adorned with stars!”
'18': >-
  “Have mercy on me, O gentle one—see, these palms are joined by me in
  supplication. Or else, depart quickly; I do not wish to look upon a pitiless
  woman.”
'19': >-
  Unable to bear the sight of cruel Kaikeyī—because of whom this calamity had
  befallen him—the king spoke thus, with palms held together.
'20': >-
  Knowing the duties of kings, he again sought to appease Kaikeyī—he who was
  righteous in conduct, now wretched, wholly dependent on her, and as one whose
  life was slipping away.
'21': >-
  “Grant your favor, O noble lady—O queen—especially to this king. This, O
  fair-hipped one, has not been spoken by me without cause.”
'22': >-
  “Show me a righteous grace, O child; for you are compassionate at heart. Be
  pleased, O queen: Rāma is mine, and the kingdom, bestowed by you, shall be
  imperishable.”
'23': >-
  “O woman with dark glances, obtain renown—you shall attain the highest fame.
  This will be dear to me, to my Rāma, to the people, to the elders, and to
  Bharata as well. O broad-hipped one, do this, O lovely-faced, fair-eyed lady.”
'24': >-
  But the cruel one uttered no word, even after hearing the strange and piteous
  lament of her lord—the king of pure intent, while she was of wicked
  intent—wretched, with coppery tears clinging to his eyes.
'25': >-
  Then that king, fainting once more, and seeing his beloved displeased and
  speaking contrary to him regarding his son’s banishment, fell down upon the
  ground, senseless and overwhelmed with sorrow.
'26': >-
  Thus that night passed for the afflicted, high-minded man, breathing painfully
  and in dread; and when they tried to rouse him, that best of kings then kept
  warding off every attempt to awaken him.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the thirteenth canto, called “Daśaratha’s Lament,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
