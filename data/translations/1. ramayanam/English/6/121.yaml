  Now begins, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-twenty-first canto, called “The Receiving Back of Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Hearing these auspicious words spoken by the Grandfather (Brahmā), Vibhāvasu
  (Agni, the Fire-god) at once sprang up, taking Vaidehī upon his lap.
'2': >-
  Then Havyavāhana (the Bearer of oblations), shaking off that funeral pyre,
  quickly rose up in embodied form, holding Janaka’s daughter in his grasp.
'3': >-
  She shone like the young sun, adorned with ornaments of heated gold; clad in
  red garments, a youthful maiden, with dark hair curling in waves.
'4': >-
  Wearing garlands and ornaments unsoiled and unwearied, and of that very same
  blameless and lovely form, Vibhāvasu placed Vaidehī upon his lap and delivered
  her to Rāma.
'5': >-
  Then Pāvaka (Fire), the witness of the world, spoke to Rāma: “This is your
  Vaidehī, O Rāma; in her there is no sin.”
'6': >-
  “Neither in speech, nor in mind, nor in understanding, nor even by her
  glance—this noble lady of pure conduct has in any way transgressed you.”
'7': >-
  “She was carried off by Rāvaṇa, that rākṣasa swollen with valour; separated
  from you, she became wretched and helpless, dwelling in a lonely place.”
'8': >-
  “Shut up within the inner apartments and kept under guard, her mind fixed on
  you and wholly devoted to you, she was watched over by rākṣasī women—terrible
  and of dreadful intent.”
'9': >-
  “Though tempted in many ways and threatened again and again, Maithilī, with
  her inmost self absorbed in you, never gave a thought to that rākṣasa.”
'10': >-
  “Accept Maithilī, of purified disposition and free from sin. Nothing further
  is to be said; this I command you.”
'11': >-
  Then righteous-souled Rāma, best of speakers, hearing those words, with eyes
  trembling in joy, became glad at heart and reflected for a moment.
'12': >-
  Thus addressed, the great-splendoured Rāma—steadfast, of mighty prowess, best
  among upholders of dharma—spoke to the foremost of the thirty gods (Agni).
'13': >-
  “In the worlds, Sītā indeed must necessarily be held to be pure; for this
  auspicious lady has dwelt for a long time within the inner apartments of
  Rāvaṇa.”
'14': >-
  “If I do not have Jānakī purified, people will surely say of me—‘Foolish
  indeed is Rāma, slave to desire, the son of Daśaratha.’”
'15': >-
  “Yet I myself know Sītā, Janaka’s daughter, to be one whose heart is devoted
  to none other, who keeps my very mind as her sole refuge and safeguard.”
'16': >-
  “This large-eyed one, protected by her own splendour—Rāvaṇa could not overstep
  her any more than the great ocean can overpass its shoreline.”
'17': >-
  “But for the sake of establishing faith among the three worlds, taking truth
  as my support, I endured even Vaidehī’s entering into the blazing fire.”
'18': >-
  “For that utterly wicked one was not able—even in his mind—to violate
  Maithilī, unattainable as she was, like a flaming tongue of fire.”
'19': >-
  “She does not deserve this misery, dwelling in Rāvaṇa’s inner palace; for Sītā
  is not other than me, as sunlight is not other than the Sun.”
'20': >-
  “Maithilī, Janaka’s daughter, is pure in the three worlds; I cannot abandon
  her, any more than a self-possessed man can abandon his own fame.”
'21': >-
  “And surely it is for me to do what is beneficial to the words of you all—of
  the lords of the world who are affectionate and who speak thus for what is
  good.”
'22': >-
  Having spoken thus, the victorious, mighty-armed Rāma—praised for the deed he
  had done—was reunited with his beloved; and Rāghava, of great renown, fit
  indeed for happiness, experienced happiness.
'23': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa—composed by the seer, the revered epic
  poem—in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the one-hundred-and-twenty-first canto, called “The
  Receiving Back of Sītā.”
