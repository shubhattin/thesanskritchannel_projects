  Now, in the revered Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  Thirtieth Sarga, named “Hanumān’s Deliberation on What Ought and Ought Not to
  Be Done.”
'1': >-
  Hanumān too, bold and valiant, heard everything exactly as it was—Sītā’s
  words, Trijaṭā’s words, and also the threats hurled by the rākṣasīs.
'2': >-
  Gazing upon that noble lady, like a goddess in a celestial grove, the monkey
  began to ponder many kinds of thoughts.
'3': >-
  “She whom thousands upon thousands of monkeys—many tens of thousands—have been
  searching for in all directions, has been found by me indeed.”
'4': >-
  “By well-arranged espionage—moving about concealed, observing the enemy’s
  strength—so far I have examined this thoroughly.”
'5': >-
  “The distinctions among the rākṣasas have been observed; this city too has
  been inspected; and the might of that lord of rākṣasas, Rāvaṇa, has also been
  assessed.”
'6': >-
  “How shall I hearten his wife—she who longs to behold her husband—so that she
  may be consoled by seeing her lord, that immeasurable one who is compassionate
  to all beings?”
'7': >-
  “I shall console her—she whose face is like the full moon—who has never before
  seen sorrow, and who, fallen into sorrow now, cannot find its end.”
'8': >-
  “If I depart without consoling this chaste lady, whose mind is crushed by
  grief, my going would be attended with fault.”
'9': >-
  “For if I go away, this illustrious princess—seeing no refuge—Jānakī may
  abandon her life.”
'10': >-
  “And that mighty-armed one, whose face is like the full moon, yearning to see
  Sītā, is indeed the proper person to comfort her.”
'11': >-
  “Yet before the rākṣasīs, speaking openly is impossible and unsafe. What then
  must be done? I have fallen into a hard strait.”
'12': >-
  “If, within what remains of this night, she is not consoled by me, then in
  every way there is no doubt—she will give up her life.”
'13': >-
  “If Rāma were to ask me, ‘What words did Sītā speak to me?’ what shall I
  answer him, having not spoken with that fair-waisted lady?”
'14': >-
  “If I go from here in haste without Sītā’s message, the scion of Kakutstha
  would burn me with the fierce fire of his angered eyes.”
'15': >-
  “And if I rouse her lord for Sītā’s sake without securing the purpose, then
  the coming of him and his army will become fruitless.”
'16': >-
  “Therefore, finding an interval while the rākṣasīs stand about, I shall today
  gently console this lady who is overwhelmed with anguish.”
'17': >-
  “For I am exceedingly small of body, and moreover a monkey; and here I shall
  utter human speech, well-formed and refined.”
'18': >-
  “If I speak in refined, Sanskrit-like words, like a twice-born, Sītā may
  become afraid, thinking me to be Rāvaṇa.”
'19': >-
  “Yet it is necessary that I speak human words, meaningful and apt; only thus
  can I soothe this blameless lady—there is no other way.”
'20': >-
  “Beholding my form and hearing such speech, Jānakī—who has previously been
  terrified by rākṣasas—will again fall into fear.”
'21': >-
  “Then, seized by dread, that high-minded, large-eyed lady, knowing Rāvaṇa to
  be a shape-shifter at will, may raise a cry.”
'22': >-
  “And when Sītā makes a sound, the troop of rākṣasīs—terrible, armed with
  diverse weapons, like Death itself—would rush in at once.”
'23': >-
  “Then, surrounding me on every side, those grim-faced ones, mighty in
  strength, would strive either to slay me or to seize me.”
'24': >-
  “Seeing me running about, they would become suspicious even of the branches,
  twigs, and trunks of the best of trees.”
'25': >-
  “And seeing my great form moving in the grove, the rākṣasīs, terrified with
  fear, would cry out with distorted voices.”
'26': >-
  “Then the rākṣasīs would summon the rākṣasas as well—those appointed by the
  lord of rākṣasas—within the residence of the rākṣasa-king.”
'27': >-
  “Those wielding spears, arrows, swords, and weapons of many kinds would fall
  upon this fray with speed, driven by alarm.”
'28': >-
  “Hemmed in all around by them, I might indeed crush the rākṣasa host; yet I
  would not be able to reach the farther shore of the great ocean.”
'29': >-
  “Or many swift-acting ones might surround and capture me; then this mission
  would remain unaccomplished, and my capture would come to pass.”
'30': >-
  “Fond of violence, they might harm this daughter of Janaka; then the
  undertaking of Rāma and Sugrīva would be ruined.”
'31': >-
  “In this place, where the path is lost and rākṣasas surround on all sides, and
  which is encircled by the sea and well-guarded, Jānakī dwells.”
'32': >-
  “If, in battle, I am slain or captured by the rākṣasas, I see no other helper
  for Rāma in accomplishing the task.”
'33': >-
  “Reflecting, I do not see any monkey who, if I were slain, could cross the
  great ocean that spans a hundred yojanas.”
'34': >-
  “Indeed, I am capable—if I so wish—of slaying even thousands of rākṣasas; yet
  I would not be able to reach the farther shore of the great ocean.”
'35': >-
  “Indeed, I am capable—if I so wish—of slaying even thousands of rākṣasas; yet
  I would not be able to reach the farther shore of the great ocean.”
'36': >-
  “Here is a great fault if I speak to Sītā; yet if I do not speak, the princess
  of Videha may abandon her life.”
'37': >-
  “Things and purposes, opposed to place and time, come into conflict—like
  darkness when the sun rises—when one meets a messenger who is irresolute.”
'38': >-
  “Even a decision made between what is beneficial and what is harmful does not
  shine when it wavers; for messengers who fancy themselves wise do indeed
  destroy undertakings.”
'39': >-
  “How may the mission not be ruined? How may indecision not be mine? And how
  may my crossing of the ocean not become vain?”
'40': >-
  “How shall she hear my words and yet not be agitated?” Thus pondering,
  Hanumān—the wise—formed his resolve.
'41': >-
  “Praising Rāma, whose deeds are untroubled, and who is her true and noble
  kinsman, I shall not alarm her, whose mind is set upon that kinsman.”
'42': >-
  “Offering auspicious words, consonant with dharma, of Rāma—best among the
  Ikṣvākus, and self-possessed—”
'43': >-
  “I shall cause her to hear everything, speaking sweetly; I shall arrange all
  matters so that Sītā will have faith.”
'44': >-
  “Thus, having deliberated in many ways, mighty in power, and gazing upon the
  beloved lady of the Lord of the world, Hanumān—stationed amidst the branches
  and boughs of a tree—spoke words that were sweet and truthful.”
'45': >-
  Thus ends the Thirtieth Sarga, named “Hanumān’s Deliberation on What Ought and
  Ought Not to Be Done,” in the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the
  Primeval Epic.
