  Now begins the Thirty-sixth Sarga in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Attainment of Boons by Hanūmān, and related matters.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon Vāyu, sorely afflicted by grief over his son’s being struck down, on
  beholding the Grandsire (Brahmā), lifted up that child and rose up before
  Dhātṛ (the Creator).
'2': >-
  Adorned with quivering earrings, with a garlanded diadem, and with ornaments
  of refined gold, Vāyu fell at the feet of the Ordainer (Brahmā), and with
  threefold reverence stood waiting upon him.
'3': >-
  Then that knower of the Vedas (Brahmā), beholding Vāyu resplendent with his
  long ornaments, raised him up with his hand and gently stroked and caressed
  that child.
'4': >-
  The moment he was touched, he—by the sportive, lotus-born Lord—at once
  regained life, even as grain, when sprinkled with water, revives.
'5': >-
  Seeing him restored to life, Prāṇa (the vital breath), borne by the
  Fragrance-bearing Wind, moved about among all beings with joy, as formerly,
  when it had been restrained.
'6': >-
  Freed from the obstruction of the Maruts, those creatures became glad;
  released from cold and burning, they were like lotus-ponds with their lotuses
  again surrounded by water.
'7': >-
  Then Brahmā—the three-yoked, three-peaked, three-aboded Lord, worshipped by
  the gods—spoke, desiring to do what was pleasing to Māruta (Vāyu).
'8': >-
  “O Mahendra, and Īśvara, and Varuṇa, and Prajeśvara, and Dhaneśvara! Though
  all of you know it already, I shall declare what is wholesome—listen.
'9': >-
  By this child a task must be accomplished—one that will have to be done for
  you all. Therefore, to gratify this Māruta, each of you declare fitting
  boons.”
'10': >-
  Then the Thousand-eyed (Indra), filled with delight and with auspicious
  countenance, lifting up a garland made of blue lotuses, spoke these words:
'11': >-
  “As his jaw (hanu) was struck down by the thunderbolt discharged from my hand,
  this tiger among monkeys shall be known by name as Hanumān.”
'12': >-
  “And I shall grant him a supreme and wondrous boon: from this day onward he
  shall be invulnerable to my thunderbolt.”
'13': >-
  Then Mārtaṇḍa (the Sun), the blessed dispeller of darkness, spoke there: “Of
  my own radiance I bestow upon him a hundredth part.”
'14': >-
  “And when the power arises in him to study the śāstras, then I shall give him
  that śāstra by which he shall become eloquent.”
'15': >-
  “And none shall be his equal in the discernment of the śāstras.” Varuṇa too
  bestowed a boon: “Death shall not come upon him even in a hundred thousand
  years—neither through my noose nor through water.”
'16': >-
  Yama, being pleased, said: “I grant him invulnerability to my staff, and
  perpetual freedom from disease, and also the absence of dejection in battle.”
'17': >-
  “This mace of mine shall not slay him in combats.” Thus spoke the boon-giver,
  the tawny-eyed one (Yama).
'18': >-
  “From me and from my weapons he shall not be slain.” Thus was bestowed upon
  him even by Śaṅkara (Śiva) the highest boon.
'19': >-
  “He shall be invulnerable to all Brahmā’s rods (all punishments/fiats of
  Brahmā); and he shall be long-lived and great-souled.” Thus Brahmā spoke the
  words.
'20': >-
  And Viśvakarmā, seeing that infant like the young Sun, that foremost of
  artisans, the great-minded one, bestowed a boon upon him.
'21': >-
  “By the divine weapons fashioned by me, in battle he shall attain
  invulnerability; and he shall be long-lived.”
'22': >-
  Then, seeing him adorned with the boons of the gods, the four-faced Lord
  (Brahmā), pleased in mind, spoke to Vāyu, the Guru of the world:
'23': >-
  “O Māruta, your son—Māruti—shall be a terror to foes and a giver of
  fearlessness to friends; he shall be unconquerable.”
'24': >-
  “Assuming any form at will, moving as he wills, going where he wills—best of
  leapers—his course shall be unobstructed, and he shall become famed.”
'25': >-
  “For the destruction of Rāvaṇa and for the accomplishment of what is dear to
  Rāma, he shall perform deeds in battle that cause the hair to stand on end.”
'26': >-
  Having spoken thus, and taking leave of Māruta together with the immortals,
  all of them—Brahmā going foremost—departed, each as he had come.
'27': >-
  And the Fragrance-bearing Wind too, taking up his son, brought him home, and
  declared to Añjanā that her child had come forth endowed with boons.
'28': >-
  Having obtained those boons, he became possessed of the power of the
  boon-giving; and with strength established within himself, he swelled full,
  like the ocean.
'29': >-
  Even while thus being filled with force, the best of monkeys then, fearless,
  committed offences in the hermitages of the great Ṛṣis.
'30': >-
  He would break, tear apart, and utterly destroy the ladles and vessels, the
  sacred fires of the Agnihotra, and the stores of bark-garments and
  antelope-skins belonging to the tranquil sages.
'31': >-
  Such deeds did the mighty one set in motion; made invulnerable by Śambhu, he
  could not be slain by any of Brahmā’s rods.
'32': Knowing him well, the Ṛṣis endured it, because of his power.
'33': >-
  Just as this monkey—son of Añjanā by Keśarī and by Vāyu—though forbidden,
  still transgresses the bounds, so he continued.
'34': >-
  Then the great Ṛṣis, angered—descended from the line of Bhṛgu and
  Aṅgiras—cursed him, O best of the Raghus, not with excessive wrath, yet filled
  with indignation.
'35': >-
  “Since, O plavaṅgama, you harass us relying upon your strength, you shall, for
  a long time, be unaware of it—your understanding deluded by our curse. But
  when your fame is brought to your remembrance, then shall your strength
  increase.”
'36': >-
  Then, his fiery energy and vigor being taken away by the potency of the sages’
  words, he moved about those hermitages with a gentle disposition.
'37': >-
  Now there was a certain Ṛkṣarajas by name, father of Vāli and Sugrīva; he was
  king over all the monkeys, shining with splendor like the Sun.
'38': >-
  That lord of the monkeys, having ruled the Vānaras for a long time, came to
  his end in due course of time, in accordance with the law of death.
'39': >-
  When he had thus set, then, by counsellors skilled in counsel, Vāli was
  installed in the paternal position; and Sugrīva was placed in Vāli’s station.
'40': >-
  With Sugrīva, his friendship was without duplicity and free from breach, from
  childhood—like that of Fire with the Wind.
'41': >-
  By the power of the curse alone, he does not know his own strength, at the
  time when the enmity between Vāli and Sugrīva arose, O Rāma.
'42': >-
  For this Sugrīva, O Rāma, is not (in truth) to be blamed, even though he was
  driven about by Vāli.
'43': >-
  The god (indeed) knows: this Māruti does not know the strength within
  himself—this best of monkeys, whose power was taken away by a Ṛṣi’s curse.
'44': >-
  Whether a lion be blocked by an elephant, or stands firm, supported in
  battle—(so is he, when roused).
'45': >-
  In valor, zeal, surpassing might, good conduct, sweetness of disposition, in
  policy and impolicy, in depth, in skill, in great heroism and in steadfast
  courage—who in the world is superior to Hanūmān?
'46': >-
  Again, this lord of monkeys, intending to learn grammar, with mind set on
  questioning and facing the Sun, went from the rising mountain to the setting
  mountain, bearing a great treatise beyond measure.
'47': >-
  With its aphorisms, explanations, meanings, words, and import—complete with
  compendium—this lord of monkeys indeed mastered it; for in śāstra none equal
  to him exists, nor in sharp intelligence, nor likewise in the course of metre.
'48': >-
  In all branches of knowledge and in the ordinances of austerity, he rivals
  even the preceptor of the gods. This one, knower of the meaning of the new
  grammar, shall become a Brahmā as it were, by your favor.
'49': >-
  Who shall stand before Hanūmān—like the ocean eager to overflow, like fire
  eager to burn up the worlds, like Death himself at the dissolution of the age?
'50': >-
  And he indeed, and other great lords of monkeys—Sugrīva, Mainda, Dvivida,
  together with Nīla; Tārā, Tārā’s son (Aṅgada), Nala, and Rambha—were created
  by the gods for your sake, O Rāma.
'51': >-
  Thus has all been related—the very matter about which you asked me. I have
  recounted this deed of Hanūmān in his childhood.
'52': >-
  Hearing what Agastya had told, Rāma and Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) went into the
  utmost astonishment—(and so did) the Vānaras together with the Rākṣasas.
'53': >-
  Then Agastya said to Rāma: “You have heard all this; and you have also seen
  and conversed (with him). O Rāma, let us depart.”
'54': >-
  Hearing this word of Agastya of terrible splendor, Rāghava—with joined palms,
  bowing low—spoke this to the great Ṛṣi:
'55': >-
  “Today my deities are gladdened—my Pitṛs and great-grandfathers as well. By
  your very sight, they are ever pleased, together with my kinsmen.
'56': >-
  “But this indeed is to be made known by me—what I say with longing: by
  compassion you must do it for my sake.
'57': >-
  “Having established the townsmen and the country folk in their proper duties,
  I have come for my own purpose. By the influence of you righteous ones, I
  shall perform sacrifices as well.”
'58': >-
  “In my sacrifices you, O mighty ones, shall ever be the officiating
  members—indeed, ever seeking to show me favor.”
'59': >-
  “Taking refuge in you, whose sins have been burnt away by austerity, I shall
  be blessed by the Pitṛs and shall remain in deep contentment.”
'60': >-
  “Therefore you must come here constantly, gathered together.” Hearing that,
  Agastya and the other Ṛṣis, of well-tempered vows—
'61': —said to him, “So be it,” and began to depart.
'62': >-
  Having thus spoken, all those Ṛṣis went away as they had come; and Rāghava,
  astonished, pondered upon that very matter.
'63': >-
  Then, when the Sun had set, dismissing the kings and the Vānaras, that best of
  men duly performed the twilight worship; and when night had begun, he entered
  the inner apartments.
'64': >-
  Thus ends the Thirty-sixth Sarga of the Uttara Kāṇḍa in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the sacred, ancient epic, entitled “The Attainment of Boons by Hanūmān, and
  related matters.”
