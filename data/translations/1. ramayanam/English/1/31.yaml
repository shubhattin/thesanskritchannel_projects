  Now begins the Thirty-first Sarga, entitled “Departure for Mithilā,” in the
  Bālakāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then, there in that place, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—having fulfilled their
  purpose—spent that night; those heroic brothers dwelt happily, their inner
  selves greatly delighted.
'2': >-
  And when the night had turned to dawn, having completed their morning rites,
  the two of them approached the sage Viśvāmitra and the other ṛṣis as well.
'3': >-
  Having saluted that best of sages, who blazed like fire itself, the two
  sweet-spoken princes addressed him with words most noble and full of respect.
'4': >-
  “O tiger among sages, here we stand, your attendants, come before you. Command
  us, O best of ascetics—what is it that we should do in obedience to your
  bidding?”
'5': >-
  When they had spoken thus, all the great ṛṣis, placing Viśvāmitra at their
  head, spoke these words to Rāma:
'6': >-
  “For Janaka, that best of men, the king of Mithilā, there will be a
  sacrifice—most righteous and supremely dharmic. There we shall go.”
'7': >-
  “And you too, O tiger among men, shall go along with us; and there you ought
  to behold a wondrous jewel among bows.”
'8': >-
  “For formerly, O best of men, that bow was bestowed in the sacrificial
  assembly by the gods—of immeasurable might, dreadful in power, and exceedingly
  resplendent in the rite.”
'9': >-
  “Neither the gods, nor Gandharvas, nor Asuras, nor Rākṣasas—and in no way men
  at all—are capable of stringing it and setting it in readiness.”
'10': >-
  “Even mighty princes and rulers of the earth, wishing to ascertain the
  strength of that bow, were unable to string it.”
'11': >-
  “That bow, O tiger among men, belongs to that great-souled king of Mithilā.
  There, O Kākutstha, you shall behold it, and you shall also behold that
  sacrifice—most wondrous indeed.”
'12': >-
  “And that excellent bow—being the fruit and reward of the sacrifice—was sought
  by that Mithilā king, O tiger among men, as a well-proportioned bow, from all
  the deities.”
'13': >-
  “O Rāghava, that bow—an object of worship and reverence—was kept in the palace
  of that king, honored with many kinds of perfumes and with incense fragrant
  with agaru.” Having spoken thus, that best of sages then set out on the
  journey, along with the host of ṛṣis and with Kākutstha, after taking leave of
  the deities of the forest.
'14': >-
  “May auspiciousness be yours. I—having accomplished my vow—shall depart from
  Siddhāśrama, and go to the northern bank of the Jāhnavī, to Himavān, that
  lofty mountain-mass.”
'15': >-
  Thus speaking, that tiger among sages—Kauśika, rich in ascetic wealth—began to
  proceed, setting his course toward the northern direction.
'16': >-
  As that best of sages went forth, a company of followers went after him; and
  in that march there was but a hundred carts of those brahma-vādins (speakers
  of sacred lore).
'17': >-
  And the herds of deer and the flocks of birds dwelling in Siddhāśrama also
  followed after the great-souled Viśvāmitra, the ascetic of mighty austerities.
'18': >-
  Then the sage-host turned those birds back. Having traveled far along the
  road, with the sun hanging low in the sky,
'19': >-
  having gone a long distance while the sun was declining, the groups of sages,
  composed and self-restrained, made their halt on the bank of the river Śoṇa.
'20': >-
  When the sun had set, they bathed, and having duly offered oblations into the
  sacred fires, those of immeasurable splendor sat down, placing Viśvāmitra at
  their head.
'21': >-
  Rāma too, together with Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), having honored those sages, sat
  in front of wise Viśvāmitra.
'22': >-
  Then Rāma, of great radiance—the tiger among men—questioned Viśvāmitra, the
  ascetic rich in tapas, filled with curiosity.
'23': >-
  “Blessed sir, what country is this—rich and prosperous, adorned with splendid
  forests? I desire to hear of it; for your good, pray tell me the truth of it
  in full.”
'24': >-
  Urged by Rāma’s words, that great ascetic of excellent vows related, in the
  midst of the sages, the entire account of that land.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the Thirty-first Sarga, entitled “Departure for Mithilā,” in the
  Bālakāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
