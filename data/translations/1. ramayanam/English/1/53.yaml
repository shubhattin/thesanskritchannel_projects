  Now begins the fifty-third canto, named “The Attempt to Purchase Shabalaa,” in
  the Baala-Kaanda of the holy Vaalmiki-Raamaayana.
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by Vasiṣṭha, O subduer of foes, Shabalaa—the wish-fulfilling
  cow—forthwith produced, according to each one’s desire, whatever each person
  sought.
'2': >-
  She produced sugarcanes, honeys, parched grains, intoxicating drinks of
  maireya, and excellent wines; and also costly beverages, and foods of many
  kinds as well.
'3': >-
  There were heaps of richly steaming boiled rice, like mountains; and delicious
  dishes, and soups, and likewise streams of curds.
'4': >-
  And there were sweetmeats of many flavors and tastes, and so too confections;
  and meals fully prepared, and jaggery preparations by the thousand.
'5': >-
  All was made exceedingly satisfying, with throngs of people delighted and
  well-nourished; and the host of Viśvāmitra, O Raama, was fully gratified by
  Vasiṣṭha.
'6': >-
  Indeed, Viśvāmitra the royal sage then became pleased and well-fed—he the king
  with his excellent inner apartments, together with brahmins and priests.
'7': >-
  Along with his ministers and counselors, and with his attendants, being
  honored at that time, he—being in accord with the supreme sage—spoke this to
  Vasiṣṭha.
'8': >-
  “I have been honored by you, O Brahman—well received by one worthy to offer
  honor. Hear now; I shall declare a statement, O master of speech and one
  skilled in words.
'9': >-
  “Let Shabalaa be given to me in exchange for a hundred thousand cows; for,
  revered sir, this is a jewel, and a king is indeed one who bears away jewels.
'10': >-
  “Therefore give Shabalaa to me; by right and in accordance with dharma she is
  mine, O twice-born.” Thus addressed, the blessed Vasiṣṭha, best of sages,
'11': >-
  —that righteous-souled one—replied to Viśvāmitra, the lord of the earth: “I
  will not give up Shabalaa, neither for a hundred thousand nor even for
  hundreds of crores of cows.
'12': >-
  “O King, I will not give Shabalaa even for heaps of silver, O tamer of foes.
  She is not fit to be relinquished by me.”
'13': >-
  “Shabalaa is everlasting for me, like the fame of a self-possessed man. In her
  depend my offerings of havya to the gods and kavya to the manes, and likewise
  the very sustenance of my life.
'14': >-
  “On her depend my Agnihotra, and oblations and sacrificial offerings; the
  invocations of ‘svaahaa’ and ‘vaṣaṭ,’ and also the various kinds of sacred
  knowledge.
'15': >-
  “O royal sage, all this is dependent upon her here—of this there is no doubt.
  By truth I declare: she is my all, and she is the cause of my contentment as
  well.
'16': >-
  “For many reasons, O King, I will not give Shabalaa to you.” Thus spoken by
  Vasiṣṭha, Viśvāmitra then spoke,
'17': >-
  —with much greater anger—he who was skilled in speech and in words: “I give
  you fourteen thousand elephants, fitted with golden caparisons and
  neck-ornaments, adorned with golden goads.
'18': “And I give you chariots of gold yoked with four white horses.
'19': >-
  “I give you eight hundred horses adorned with tinkling bells—horses of the
  best breeds, born in noble lines, of great vigor; and I give you also eleven
  thousand more, O you of excellent vows.
'20': >-
  “And I give one crore of cows, of many colors, distinguished by their kinds,
  and of fitting age. Let Shabalaa be given to me.”
'21': >-
  “Whatever jewels you desire, or gold, O best of brahmins—so much I give you,
  all of it. Let Shabalaa be given to me.”
'22': >-
  Thus addressed by the wise Viśvāmitra, the blessed Vasiṣṭha said, “O King, in
  no way whatsoever will I give Shabalaa.”
'23': >-
  “For this alone is my jewel; this alone is my wealth; this alone is my all;
  this alone is my very life.
'24': >-
  “The new-moon and full-moon rites, and sacrifices accompanied by due
  sacrificial fees—this alone is mine, O King; and likewise the various ritual
  acts.
'25': >-
  “All my rites are rooted in her, O King—of this there is no doubt. Of what use
  is much talk? I will not give away the wish-yielding cow.”
'26': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-third canto, named “The Attempt to Purchase Shabalaa,” in
  the Baala-Kaanda of the holy Vaalmiki-Raamaayana, the primeval epic.
