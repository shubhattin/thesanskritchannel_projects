  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the thirtieth
  canto, named “The Description of Autumn.”
'1': >-
  When Sugrīva had entered his dwelling, and the clouds had been released from
  the sky, Rāma remained there through the season of rains, afflicted by the
  torment of desire and sorrow.
'2': >-
  Beholding the pale, spotless sky, and the pure orb of the moon, and seeing the
  autumn night, as though anointed with moonlight,
'3': >-
  and observing Sugrīva given over to pleasures, and Jānakī lost from sight, and
  seeing time pass away—he, exceedingly distressed, sank into bewilderment.
'4': >-
  But after a short while, regaining consciousness, the wise Rāghava began to
  ponder Vaidehī, though she was only present in his mind.
'5': >-
  And seeing the clear sky, with the lightning-bearing clouds departed, and
  hearing the haunts of cranes resounding with their calls, he lamented in a
  voice choked with anguish.
'6': >-
  Seated on the summit of a mountain adorned with veins of gold-ore, gazing on
  the autumn sky, his mind went to his beloved.
'7': >-
  She who delights in the hermitage that echoes with the cries of cranes—how can
  that young maiden delight now, without me?
'8': >-
  Seeing the blossoming asana trees, spotless like gold—how can that young
  maiden take delight, seeing me not, while I behold her not?
'9': >-
  She who formerly, at the sweet call of the ruddy geese, would awaken—she of
  lovely limbs and gentle speech—how can she delight now, without me?
'10': >-
  Hearing the calls of the cakravāka birds with their companions, how will she
  fare—she whose lotus-like eyes are large and fair?
'11': >-
  Lakes and rivers and ponds, groves and forests—how can I now, wandering
  without her of deer-fawn eyes, find any happiness?
'12': >-
  May not Love, continually heightened by the qualities of autumn, grievously
  torment that delicate lady, because of separation from me and because of her
  tender nature?
'13': >-
  Thus and in many such ways the best of men, the king’s son, lamented—like a
  bird, a sāraṅga, crying for water from the lord of the gods.
'14': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, fortunate and noble, who had been roaming on delightful
  mountain-slopes seeking fruits, turned back and saw his elder brother.
'15': >-
  Seeing the high-minded Rāma, alone in a lonely place, overcome by an
  unbearable anguish of thought and as though senseless, Saumitrī, deeply
  afflicted by his brother’s despair, quickly approached and spoke in a mournful
  tone.
'16': >-
  What, noble one, is gained by falling under the power of desire? What by the
  defeat of one’s own manly effort? This composure is withdrawn through
  shame—why is it not restored here by the discipline of yoga?
'17': >-
  Undertake, dear brother, the proper exertion of action, the serenity of the
  mind, and the timely practice of collected concentration; being steadfast and
  undispirited, bring about the cause through your own deeds, and rely on the
  strength of your allies.
'18': >-
  O lord of the human race, Jānakī is not without your protection—she is not to
  be easily obtained by another. And, O hero worthy of boons, no one who draws
  near a blazing fire-tongue remains unburnt.
'19': >-
  Then Rāma spoke to Lakṣmaṇa—marked by auspicious signs, unassailable, and true
  to his nature—words beneficial and wholesome, intent on right policy, and well
  composed with conciliation, righteousness, and purpose.
'20': >-
  Without doubt the task must be kept in view, and the particular course of
  action also must be pursued; yet the fruit of a youth’s prowess—now fully
  grown and hard to withstand—need not be anxiously doubted.
'21': >-
  Then, thinking again and again of Maithilī of lotus-petal eyes, Rāma spoke to
  Lakṣmaṇa, his mouth parched.
'22': >-
  “Having satisfied the earth with water, as though Indra of the thousand eyes
  had done so; having brought the crops to completion; the season, its work
  accomplished, now stands settled,”
'23': >-
  “the clouds, with their long, deep rumblings, preceded by mountains and trees
  (beneath them), having poured forth their waters, have become calm, O prince,”
'24': >-
  “dark as blue lotus petals, having darkened all the ten quarters, those
  rain-clouds—like rut-maddened elephants—now move with their force stilled,”
'25': >-
  “pregnant with waters and swift of onset, fragrant with kuṭaja and arjuna
  blossoms, the winds of rain, having ranged about, have ceased, gentle one,
  though once they rose impetuously,”
'26': >-
  “the roar of the clouds, of the elephants, and of the peacocks, O Lakṣmaṇa,
  and the sound of the mountain-waterfalls, has suddenly become quiet,”
'27': >-
  “sprinkled by great clouds, the clear and variegated mountain-slopes shine, as
  though anointed with the moon’s rays,”
'28': >-
  “on the branches of the saptacchada trees, in the radiance of the stars, the
  sun, and the moon, and in the graceful movements of the best elephants, autumn
  has now begun, distributing beauty and splendor,”
'29': >-
  “even now Fortune, adorned with the excellences of the autumn season and
  possessing many a resting-place and varied loveliness, shines exceedingly in
  lotus-lakes awakened by the grasp of the sun,”
'30': >-
  “fragrant with the scent of saptacchada blossoms, sung by swarms of bees,
  attended by winds that follow the rut-maddened elephants, it shines more and
  more, as though dispelling pride,”
'31': >-
  “with splendid, broad-winged birds newly arrived—dear to Love—and sprinkled
  with lotus-pollen, the swans sport along with the cakravākas on the sandbanks
  of great rivers,”
'32': >-
  “among elephants bold with rut, among herds of cattle full of pride, and in
  low-lying rivers with clear waters, Fortune shines, divided in many ways,”
'33': >-
  “seeing the sky freed from clouds, peacocks in the forests—having cast off the
  adornment of their plumes—deprived of their former beauty, their cries
  subdued, their festivity gone, are intent only on brooding,”
'34': >-
  “with delightful, beloved, abundant fragrances, with boughs bent low by the
  heavy load of flowers, golden-hued and pleasing to the eyes—forest-glades
  appear as though illumined,”
'35': >-
  “the gaits of the best elephants—fond of lotus-stems, dear to their mates,
  roaming in the woods among blossoming flowers—are slow today, for they are
  violently intoxicated and languid with must,”
'36': >-
  “the sky is clear, as if its hue were cleansed by weapons; the river-streams
  are slender; cool breezes, chilled by water-lilies, blow; freed from darkness,
  the directions are bright,”
'37': >-
  “the earth, its mire dried by the tread of the sun’s heat, and its thick dust
  long since uncovered, is ready—today is the season of enterprise for kings
  joined in mutual enmity,”
'38': >-
  “bulls, their beauty and strength nourished by the qualities of autumn,
  delighted and dust-covered, fierce with rut and now eager for battle, bellow
  amid the herds of cattle,”
'39': >-
  “a she-elephant, filled with passion, with keener love, of noble lineage,
  moving with slow gait, follows in the forests her lord as he goes, surrounded
  by his rut-maddened company,”
'40': >-
  “abandoning their fine plumes, their natural adornment, and coming to the
  river-banks, peacocks, as if scolded by flocks of cranes, go away dejected and
  downcast,”
'41': >-
  “frightening karaṇḍava ducks and cakravākas with their great cries, lordly
  elephants, with their temples rent, stir and stir the water and drink in
  lotus-lakes adorned with well-bound lotus-blooms,”
'42': >-
  “in rivers where the mud has withdrawn, where sandbanks appear, where the
  waters are clear, where cowherds’ herds are present, and where the cries of
  cranes resound, swans alight joyfully,”
'43': >-
  “the clamors of rivers, dense waterfalls, peacocks stirred by strong winds,
  and monkeys whose celebrations are ended, have surely now fallen silent,”
'44': >-
  “serpents of many hues, their bodies greatly emaciated, unseen amid newly
  risen clouds, tormented by hunger and bearing dreadful venom, long dwelling in
  their holes, crawl forth,”
'45': >-
  “Touched by the darting rays of the moon, the stars open with delight—ah, the
  twilight, full of longing, as it were, abandons the sky of its own accord!”
'46': >-
  “Night, with a gentle face as the moon arises, with lovely eyes as the hosts
  of stars open forth, clothed in a garment of moonlight, shines like a woman
  covered in white raiment,”
'47': >-
  “having eaten the ripe sheaves of rice, a fair row of delighted cranes swiftly
  takes possession of the sky, like a garland strung together and blown about by
  the wind,”
'48': >-
  “the water in a great lake, with a lone swan asleep amid clusters of white
  lotuses, shines; and the sky, freed of clouds, appears like the full moon at
  night, strewn with multitudes of stars,”
'49': >-
  “the splendor of excellent ponds—girdled by scattered swans, garlanded with
  awakened lotuses and blue water-lilies—has increased today, like that of
  splendid women richly adorned,”
'50': >-
  “in the hour before dawn, a sound arises with the wind—mingled with the music
  of instruments, made distinct by the notes of flutes—swelling like the lowing
  of bulls and filling everything, as it were,”
'51': >-
  “shaken by gentle breezes, with the laughter of flowers along the rivers, and
  bright with the sheen of spotless linen-like cloth, the banks are adorned with
  tall reeds (kāśa-grass),”
'52': >-
  “wild bees, mighty in the forest and stout with honey-drinking, rejoicing with
  their companions, intoxicated in the woods, follow the course of the wind—pale
  with the pollen of lotuses,”
'53': >-
  “the clear water smiling with flowers, the cry of the krauñca birds, the
  rice-fields ripened, the soft breeze, and the spotless moon—all proclaim that
  the time of rains has passed away,”
'54': >-
  “the movements of the river-brides, their girdles revealed by fish, are slow
  today—like the languid walk of women who have been enjoyed by their beloveds
  in the early morning,”
'55': >-
  “with cakravākas and with water-weeds, veiled as though with white garments of
  kāśa-grass, marked with lines as with leaves, and bright—river-mouths are like
  the faces of brides,”
'56': >-
  “in forests painted with fully blossomed bāṇa-flowers, resonant with the
  joyful humming of bees, Love today is fierce—taking up his bow, raising his
  staff, terrible in his might,”
'57': >-
  “having gladdened the world with abundant rains, having filled rivers and
  ponds, having made the earth rich with completed crops, the rain-bearing
  clouds, leaving the sky, have vanished,”
'58': >-
  “the rivers of autumn show their sandbanks little by little, like the hips of
  women shy at a new union,”
'59': >-
  “with clear waters, O gentle one, resounding with the cries of kurara birds,
  crowded with flocks of cakravākas, the lakes and pools shine,”
'60': >-
  “for kings whose enmity is bound each to each and who desire victory, O
  prince, the time for enterprise has arrived, gentle one,”
'61': >-
  “this indeed is the first campaign-season of kings, O prince—and yet I do not
  see Sugrīva, nor such an exertion (from him),”
'62': >-
  “the asana trees, the saptaparṇa, and the kovidāra are seen in bloom; and
  bandhu-jīva flowers, and dark śyāmā blossoms, upon the mountain-slopes,”
'63': >-
  “strewn everywhere with swans, cranes, cakravāka birds, and kuraras—behold, O
  Lakṣmaṇa, the sandbanks of the rivers,”
'64': >-
  “four months of the rainy season have passed, like a hundred years, for me who
  am scorched by grief and do not behold Sītā,”
'65': >-
  “like a female cakravāka following her mate, that lady followed me into the
  forest—into the uneven Daṇḍaka wilderness—as though it were a
  pleasure-garden,”
'66': >-
  “to me—bereft of my beloved, distressed with sorrow, my kingdom taken away,
  and living in exile—King Sugrīva, O Lakṣmaṇa, shows no compassion,”
'67': >-
  “I am without refuge, my kingdom stolen, and outraged by Rāvaṇa; wretched, far
  from my home, consumed by longing—and I have come to him for shelter,”
'68': >-
  “for these reasons, gentle one, I—scorcher of foes—have been insulted by that
  evil-souled Sugrīva, the king of monkeys,”
'69': >-
  “having computed the time for searching for Sītā, though he had achieved his
  purpose after making an agreement, that ill-minded one does not comprehend
  (his duty),”
'70': >-
  “enter Kiṣkindhā, and speak, on my words, to Sugrīva, the chief of
  monkeys—foolish and attached to rustic pleasures,”
'71': >-
  “he who, after taking refuge in the hope of those who seek his aid—especially
  of those properly come and who have formerly helped him—destroys that hope, is
  the lowest of men in the world,”
'72': >-
  “whether the word spoken be auspicious or sinful, he who upholds it with
  truthfulness is a hero, a foremost man,”
'73': >-
  “those who do not become friends to friends who are successful and to those
  who are unsuccessful—carrion-eaters do not feed even on such ungrateful men
  though they be dead,”
'74': >-
  “surely you wish to see once more the form of my bow—with its golden
  back—drawn out by me in battle, like a mass of lightning,”
'75': >-
  “you wish again to hear, in combat, the dreadful sound of my bowstring when I
  am enraged—like the crash of a thunderbolt,”
'76': >-
  “even if matters have come to this, and even knowing his prowess, O heroic
  prince, since you are my ally, I have no anxiety,”
'77': >-
  “for the sake of which this undertaking was begun, O conqueror of hostile
  cities—Sugrīva, lord of monkeys, having gained his end, does not recognize the
  compact,”
'78': >-
  “having promised the time of the rains as the agreed season, the lord of
  monkeys—letting four months pass—sports on, and does not understand,”
'79': >-
  “sporting with his ministers and councilors, he indulges only in drinking; in
  us who are bowed down by grief, Sugrīva shows no pity,”
'80': >-
  “go and tell Sugrīva, O mighty-armed hero; and tell him also this speech—what
  is the form of my wrath,”
'81': >-
  “the path by which Vālī was slain and went (to death) is not a narrow one.
  Stand by the compact, Sugrīva—do not follow Vālī’s path,”
'82': >-
  “Vālī alone was slain by me in battle with a single arrow; but you—having
  transgressed truth—I shall slay, together with your kinsmen,”
'83': >-
  “if thus the task has been ordained, and if this is what is beneficial, O best
  of men—then speak it, O foremost of men; hurry, for time is slipping past,”
'84': >-
  “fulfill, O lord of monkeys, the truth you have promised, keeping in view
  eternal dharma; lest today, urged on by my arrows, you behold Vālī—gone to the
  world of spirits—in Yama’s realm,”
'85': >-
  “seeing his elder brother, whose anger had grown fierce indeed, lamenting and
  wretched, Lakṣmaṇa of terrible energy formed a resolute and stern decision
  regarding the lord of monkeys,”
'86': >-
  Thus ends the thirtieth canto, named “The Description of Autumn,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Primeval Epic.
