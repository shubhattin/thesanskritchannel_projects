  Now begins the Sixteenth Sarga, named “Hanūmān’s Distress (Peritāpa)”, in the
  Sundara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Having praised Sītā—she who is truly worthy of praise—the foremost of the
  monkeys again became absorbed in anxious reflection upon Rāma, who is
  delightful through his virtues.
'2': >-
  After contemplating, as it were, for a brief while, Hanūmān—the radiant
  one—his eyes troubled and filled with tears, lamented, taking refuge in the
  thought of Sītā.
'3': >-
  “She is honored by all, dear to her elders, and devotedly humble before her
  gurus—she who is beloved also of Lakṣmaṇa, the reverent and well-disciplined.
  If Sītā is indeed afflicted by sorrow, then time—for time is hard to
  overstep—presses on relentlessly.”
'4': >-
  “She, the देवी (noble lady), who knows Rāma’s resolute purpose and understands
  also the wise-minded Lakṣmaṇa, does not become excessively agitated—like the
  river Gaṅgā at the coming of the rain-clouds.”
'5': >-
  “Rāghava is indeed worthy of Vaidehī, who is equal to him in character, age,
  and conduct, and who bears the marks of an equal and noble lineage; and she,
  the dark-eyed one, is worthy of him.”
'6': >-
  Having beheld her—radiant like newly wrought gold, like Śrī (Fortune) herself,
  the beloved of the worlds—he went in mind to Rāma and spoke these words:
'7': >-
  “For the sake of this wide-eyed lady, mighty Vālī was slain; and Kabandha
  too—equal to Rāvaṇa in prowess—was struck down.”
'8': >-
  “And Virādha, the rākṣasa of dreadful valor, was slain in battle in the forest
  by Rāma after displaying his might—just as Indra slew Śambara.”
'9': >-
  “Fourteen thousand rākṣasas of terrible deeds were destroyed in Janasthāna by
  arrows that were like tongues of fire.”
'10': >-
  “Khara also was slain in combat, Triśiras was brought down, and Dūṣaṇa—of
  great splendor—was killed by Rāma, the knower of his own self.”
'11': >-
  “And the sovereignty among the vānaras—difficult to obtain, once guarded under
  Vālī’s rule—Sugrīva, renowned in the worlds, has attained for her sake.”
'12': >-
  “And the glorious ocean, lord of rivers and streams, has been crossed by me;
  and for the sake of this wide-eyed one, this very city has been examined.”
'13': >-
  “If Rāma were to overturn the earth bounded by the ocean, even that—for her
  sake—would indeed be fitting: such is my conviction.”
'14': >-
  “Whether it be dominion over the three worlds, or Sītā, the daughter of
  Janaka—complete sovereignty over the triple world would not equal even a
  fraction of Sītā.”
'15': >-
  “She is the very one—the daughter of the great-souled Janaka, righteous in
  conduct, the princess of Mithilā, Sītā, steadfast in vow to her husband.”
'16': >-
  “She arose by cleaving the earth, in a field torn by the ploughshare; she was
  strewn with auspicious dust of the furrows, like the pollen of lotuses.”
'17': >-
  “She is the illustrious eldest daughter-in-law of King Daśaratha—of noble
  conduct, of mighty stride, and one who never turns back in battles.”
'18': >-
  “She is the beloved wife of Rāma—who knows dharma, who is grateful, and who is
  self-possessed—yet she has fallen into the power of rākṣasīs.”
'19': >-
  “Abandoning all enjoyments, compelled by the strength of affection for her
  husband, and without giving thought to hardships, she entered the lonely
  forest.”
'20': >-
  “Content with fruits and roots, wholly devoted to serving her husband, she
  attains supreme joy in the forest just as she would in a palace-home.”
'21': >-
  “This golden-limbed lady, ever speaking with gentle smiles, endures this
  torment—she who deserves no share in misfortunes.”
'22': >-
  “Rāghava longs to behold this woman endowed with noble conduct, whom Rāvaṇa
  has afflicted—like a thirsty man longs for a water-tank.”
'23': >-
  “Surely, upon regaining her, Rāghava will attain joy—like a king who has
  fallen away from his kingdom and then gains the earth again.”
'24': >-
  “Cast away from pleasures of love, and deprived also of her kinsfolk, she
  sustains her own body, yearning for reunion with him.”
'25': >-
  “She does not look upon the rākṣasīs, nor upon these trees with flowers and
  fruits; her heart is fixed on one alone—surely she beholds only Rāma.”
'26': >-
  “For a woman, her husband is the highest adornment, more splendid even than
  ornaments; separated from him, though worthy of beauty, she does not shine.”
'27': >-
  “Rāma, the lord, performs what is hard indeed, being deprived of her; and she
  too, sustaining her body, does not sink down beneath sorrow.”
'28': >-
  “Knowing her—she whose hair is dark at the ends, whose eyes are like a
  hundred-petalled lotus—to be deserving of happiness yet plunged in misery, my
  own mind also is pained.”
'29': >-
  “That lady, patient as the earth, with eyes like a lotus, who was protected by
  Rāghava and Lakṣmaṇa—she is now being guarded beneath the root of a tree by
  rākṣasīs of distorted, cruel eyes.”
'30': >-
  “Like a lotus-bed struck by frost, her splendor destroyed; oppressed by a
  succession of calamities; like a cakravākī bird bereft of her mate—Janaka’s
  daughter has come to a pitiable condition.”
'31': >-
  “For her, even the aśoka trees, whose branch-tips are bent down by flowers,
  surely produce firm sorrow; and the cool-rayed sun, risen after the passing of
  winter, the thousand-rayed one, has not brought her relief.”
'32': >-
  “Having thus observed the matter, the monkey’s understanding became
  settled—‘This indeed is Sītā.’ Taking refuge in that tree, the powerful, swift
  bull among monkeys sat down upon it.”},{
'33': >-
  Thus ends the Sixteenth Sarga, named “Hanūmān’s Distress (Peritāpa)”, in the
  Sundara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
