  Now begins the sixty-sixth canto, named “The Birth of Kuśa and Lava,” in the
  Uttarakāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  On that very night when Śatrughna entered and took refuge in the leaf-thatched
  hermitage, on that same night Sītā too gave birth to twin sons.
'2': >-
  Then, at the hour of midnight, the young ascetic boys informed Vālmīki with
  glad tidings of Sītā’s auspicious delivery.
'3': >-
  “O Blessed One, Rāma’s consort has brought forth twin sons. Therefore, O
  mighty sage, ordain a protective rite that destroys all evil beings.”
'4': >-
  Hearing their words, the great seer came to that place. The two infants shone
  like the young moon, like sons of the gods, possessing great splendour.
'5': >-
  He went there with a rejoiced heart and beheld the two little princes, and he
  performed for them a protection—one that slays malignant spirits and destroys
  rākṣasas.
'6': >-
  Taking a handful of kuśa-grass and also a measure of lava (the cleansing
  powder), that twice-born sage Vālmīki bestowed upon the two a safeguarding
  charm that annihilates evil beings.
'7': >-
  The elder of the two was born first; because he was consecrated with sacred
  mantras along with kuśa-grass, and was at that time to be purified thereby,
  therefore his name became “Kuśa.”
'8': >-
  And the younger who was born after him—being duly composed and purified with
  lava, as elders perform the cleansing—his name became “Lava” indeed.
'9': >-
  Thus, those two twin-born sons came to be known by the names Kuśa and Lava;
  and, through the names given by me, they shall also attain renown.
'10': >-
  Attentively they received that protection from the sage’s own hand; and
  thereafter, being freed from all taint, they underwent that rite of
  safeguarding for the two.
'11': >-
  And while that protection was being performed, the elders carried out the
  rites of birth and name-giving, and also recited and proclaimed the name of
  Rāma, and Sītā’s auspicious delivery.
'12': >-
  At midnight Śatrughna heard exceedingly welcome news. Going at once to the
  leaf-hut, he said, “Mother, by good fortune (this has come to pass)!”
'13': >-
  Thus, for that great-souled Śatrughna, who was filled with delight, the annual
  night—the Śrāvaṇī night—passed by, along with the swift heroic undertaking.
'14': >-
  At daybreak, that most valiant one, having performed the morning rites,
  respectfully saluted the sage with joined palms, took leave of him, and then
  set out again, turning back on his way.
'15': >-
  Having gone to the bank of the Yamunā, and having spent seven nights upon the
  road, he approached to dwell in the hermitage of the sages of holy fame.
'16': >-
  There that illustrious king stayed in the company of the sages—Bhārgava and
  others—passing the time with fitting and agreeable conversations.
'17': >-
  Thus, in the company of sages eminent for golden austerities and the like,
  that foremost of the Raghu line—the son of a king—passed that night, the
  great-souled one delighting in many modes of sacred discourse.
'18': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-sixth canto, named “The Birth of Kuśa and Lava,” in the
  Uttarakāṇḍa of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the sacred epic of the seers.
