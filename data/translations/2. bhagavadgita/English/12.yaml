'0': Om. Salutations to the Supreme Self (Paramātman).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': 'Now, the Twelfth Chapter: Bhakti-yoga (the Yoga of Devotion).'
'3': 'Arjuna said:'
'4': >-
  Thus, those devotees who, ever steadfastly united (with You), worship You— and
  those also who worship the Imperishable, the Unmanifest—of these, who are the
  better knowers of Yoga?
'5': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'6': >-
  Those who, fixing their mind on Me, worship Me—ever steadfast, endowed with
  supreme faith—those are considered by Me to be the most perfectly united (in
  Yoga).
'7': >-
  But those who worship the Imperishable—indefinable, Unmanifest— all-pervading,
  unthinkable, unchanging, immovable, and eternal—
'8': >-
  Having fully restrained the whole group of senses, being even-minded
  everywhere, delighting in the welfare of all beings— they indeed attain Me
  alone.
'9': >-
  Greater is the hardship for those whose mind is attached to the Unmanifest;
  for the goal that is the Unmanifest is attained with difficulty by the
  embodied.
'10': >-
  But those who, renouncing all actions unto Me, regarding Me as the Supreme,
  worship—meditating on Me with unwavering Yoga of single-minded devotion—
'11': >-
  For them, I become, O Pārtha, the swift deliverer from the ocean of death and
  saṁsāra, for those whose consciousness is absorbed in Me.
'12': >-
  Fix your mind on Me alone; lodge your intellect in Me; thereafter you shall
  dwell in Me alone—of this there is no doubt.
'13': >-
  If, however, you are not able to steady your mind upon Me firmly, then by the
  Yoga of repeated practice seek to attain Me, O Dhanañjaya.
'14': >-
  If you are unable even to practise, then become devoted to action done for My
  sake; even performing actions for My sake, you shall attain perfection.
'15': >-
  But if you are not able even to do this, taking refuge in My Yoga, then,
  self-controlled, renounce the fruits of all actions.
'16': >-
  For knowledge is indeed superior to practice; superior to knowledge is
  meditation; superior to meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action;
  from renunciation, peace follows immediately.
'17': >-
  He who hates none, who is friendly and compassionate to all beings; who is
  free from possessiveness and free from egoism; who is equal in sorrow and joy;
  who is forgiving—
'18': >-
  Ever content, a yogin, self-controlled, of firm resolve, with mind and
  intellect dedicated to Me—such a devotee of Mine is dear to Me.
'19': >-
  He from whom the world is not agitated, and who is not agitated by the world;
  who is freed from joy, resentment, fear, and anxiety—he too is dear to Me.
'20': >-
  He who is without expectation, pure, skilful, indifferent, free from distress,
  and who has abandoned all undertakings—such a devotee of Mine is dear to Me.
'21': >-
  He who neither rejoices nor hates, neither grieves nor desires; who has
  renounced both the auspicious and the inauspicious—he who is full of devotion
  is dear to Me.
'22': >-
  He who is the same towards enemy and friend, and likewise in honour and
  dishonour; who is the same in cold and heat, in pleasure and pain; who is free
  from attachment—
'23': >-
  To whom censure and praise are equal; who is silent; content with anything
  whatsoever; having no fixed abode; steady-minded—such a person, devoted, is
  dear to Me.
'24': >-
  But those who follow this sacred nectar of dharma, as declared (by Me), with
  faith, holding Me as the Supreme Goal—those devotees are exceedingly dear to
  Me.
'25': >-
  Om—That is the Truth. Thus in the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, among the Upaniṣads,
  in the knowledge of Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue between
  Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, ends the Twelfth Chapter, entitled “Bhakti-yoga.”
