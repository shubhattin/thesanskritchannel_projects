  Now, in the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Aranya-kanda, the fiftieth chapter,
  named “Jatayu’s Assailing (of Ravana).”
'1': >-
  Then Jatayu, who had been asleep, heard that sound. He quickly looked about
  and beheld Ravana, and he also saw Vaidehi (Sita).
'2': >-
  Thereupon that foremost of birds—like a mountain-peak, with a sharp beak,
  illustrious—perched upon a tree, spoke words that were auspicious and
  righteous.
'3': >-
  “O Dashagriva! Abiding as you do in the ancient, eternal dharma, resting upon
  truth—O brother, you ought not at this time to do this blameworthy deed.
'4': >-
  “I am known by name as Jatayu, the king of vultures, of great might—like Indra
  and Varuna, a sovereign over all the world.”
'5': >-
  “Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is devoted to the welfare of the worlds. She is
  the righteous wife of that Lord of the world, renowned in glory.
'6': >-
  “Her name is Sita, the fair-hipped lady, whom you desire to carry off here.
  How can a king established in dharma lay hands upon another man’s wife?”
'7': >-
  “Especially must a king’s wife be protected, O mighty one. Turn back from this
  base course of laying hands upon another’s wife.”
'8': >-
  “A steadfast, wise man should not do that which another would censure in him.
  As one’s own wife is to be guarded from violation, so too should the wives of
  others be protected from being molested.”
'9': >-
  “Whether for wealth or for desire, the disciplined and well-bred do not
  undertake any course that is not sanctioned by the scriptures; O delight of
  Paulastya’s line, they follow dharma as their ruler.”
'10': >-
  “The king is dharma; the king is desire; and the king is the supreme
  treasure-house of wealth. Whether good or evil, dharma takes its course from
  the king as its root.”
'11': >-
  “Fickle and of sinful disposition—how is it that you, O best of rakshasas,
  having attained lordship, behave like an evil-doer mounted in an aerial car?”
'12': >-
  “He whose very nature is lust—he cannot easily be cleansed of it. For indeed,
  among the wicked-hearted, what is noble does not dwell long in its abode.”
'13': >-
  “When Rama, the righteous-souled, the mighty one, whether in your realm or in
  your city, commits no offense against you—how do you commit offense against
  him?”
'14': >-
  “If, because of Shurpanakha, Khara—who had come to Janasthana—went too far and
  was formerly slain by Rama of unwearied deeds,”
'15': >-
  “then speak here the truth as it is: what transgression of Rama is it, for
  which, having stolen away the wife of that Lord of the world, you will
  depart?”
'16': >-
  “Release Vaidehi at once, lest he, with his dreadful gaze—like Indra’s
  thunderbolt that burned Vritra—burn you as though he were the very fire of
  destruction.”
'17': >-
  “You do not perceive that you have bound a venomous serpent in the hem of your
  garment; and you do not see the noose of Death fastened about your neck.”
'18': >-
  “A burden, O gentle one, is to be borne only so long as it does not crush a
  man; and even food should be eaten only insofar as it is digested without
  causing disease.”
'19': >-
  “That deed by doing which there is no dharma, no fame, no enduring good
  repute, and only bodily distress—who would ever undertake such an act?”
'20': >-
  “Sixty thousand years have passed since my birth, O Ravana, during which I
  have duly upheld the kingdom inherited from my father and forefathers, as is
  proper.”
'21': >-
  “I am old, and you are young—bearing a bow, mounted on a chariot, armored, and
  skilled. Yet you shall not go safely after taking Vaidehi from me.”
'22': >-
  “You are not able to carry off Vaidehi by force while I am watching—any more
  than one could carry off a sure Vedic utterance grounded in reason and
  justice.”
'23': >-
  “Fight, if you are a hero! Stand for a moment, O Ravana. Slain, you shall lie
  upon the earth, as Khara lay before.”
'24': >-
  “He by whom, again and again in battle, daityas and danavas have been
  slain—Rama, though clad in bark garments—before long will kill you in war.”
'25': >-
  “What can I do, when the princes have gone far away? You will swiftly perish,
  O base one—there is no doubt, terrified of those two.”
'26': >-
  “So long as I live, you shall not take away this auspicious lady—Sita,
  lotus-petaled-eyed, the beloved queen-consort of Rama.”
'27': >-
  “Surely I must do what is dear to that great-souled one—dear to Rama, and
  likewise to Dasharatha—even at the cost of my own life.”
'28': >-
  “Stand, stand, O Dashagriva! Wait a moment, O Ravana! Like a fruit from its
  stalk, I shall make you fall from that excellent chariot. I shall grant you
  the hospitality of battle to the full measure of my life, O night-ranger.”
'29': >-
  Thus ends the fiftieth chapter, named “Jatayu’s Assailing,” in the
  Aranya-kanda of the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, the primeval epic.
