  Then, in the revered Valmiki Ramayana, in the Yuddha-kanda, begins the
  sixty-sixth canto, entitled “The Re-ordering and Rallying of the Vanara
  Hosts.”
'1': >-
  Leaping over the rampart, that mighty Kumbhakarna—vast like a mountain-peak
  and possessed of great strength—swiftly came forth from the city.
'2': >-
  And he roared a tremendous roar, making even the ocean resound—like one
  proclaiming victory with thunderous crashes, like one shattering mountains.
'3': >-
  Beholding that dreadful-eyed one advancing—one who seemed invincible even to
  Maghavat (Indra), to Yama, or to Varuna—the vanaras were struck with fear and
  fled in disorder.
'4': >-
  But seeing them thus fleeing, the prince Angada spoke—to Nala, Nila, Gavaksha,
  and to mighty Kumuda:
'5': >-
  “Forgetting your own deeds of prowess and your noble lineage, where do you go,
  terrified—like common monkeys?”
'6': >-
  “Well done, gentle friends—turn back! Why do you seek to preserve your lives?
  This terror raised by the rakshasa is not fit to stand against battle.”
'7': >-
  “This great terror of the rakshasas that has arisen—by our valor we shall
  crush it. Turn back, O leaping ones!”
'8': >-
  Then, with difficulty regaining their breath and collecting themselves here
  and there, the vanaras, seizing trees in their hands, set out again for the
  battlefield.
'9': >-
  Having turned back, those forest-dwellers, enraged, struck at Kumbhakarna with
  utmost fury—like rutting elephants in a musth-mad rage.
'10': >-
  With lofty mountain-peaks, with boulders, and with great trees whose tops were
  in bloom, those mighty ones assailed him; yet though he was being struck, he
  did not waver.
'11': >-
  Many rocks that fell upon his limbs shattered to pieces, and flowering-topped
  trees, broken, crashed down upon the ground.
'12': >-
  But he too, exceedingly wrathful, fell upon the armies of the mighty-spirited
  vanaras and churned them up—like a fire risen in a forest, consuming all.
'13': >-
  And many bull-like vanaras, drenched in blood, lay there—cast down, fallen
  upon the earth—like trees strewn with copper-red blossoms.
'14': >-
  Leaping and running, the vanaras did not even look back; some fell into the
  sea, and some were hurled up into the sky.
'15': >-
  And while those heroes were being slain by the rakshasa as though in sport,
  they fled by the very path by which they had crossed the ocean.
'16': >-
  Then, in fear, with faces drained of color, they reached uneven ground and
  low-lying places; some, like bears, climbed trees, and some took refuge on a
  mountain.
'17': >-
  Some sank into the waters; some took shelter in caves; others fell down; some
  did not halt at all. Some collapsed upon the ground; some lay as though
  asleep—like the dead.
'18': >-
  Observing those vanaras broken in spirit, Angada said this: “Stand fast! Let
  us fight. Turn back, O leaping ones!”
'19': >-
  “For you who flee, I see no place anywhere on this earth, even if you roam it
  all. All of you, return to your stations! Why do you seek to preserve your
  lives?”
'20': >-
  “If you advance weaponless, lacking steadfastness, vigor, and manly valor,
  your wives will indeed mock you—this is a blow worse than death for those who
  would live.”
'21': >-
  “All of you are born in noble lineages—vast and great. Where do you go,
  terror-stricken, like common monkeys? Truly it is unworthy—when frightened, to
  abandon valor and run.”
'22': >-
  “Those boasts of yours—spoken in the assemblies of the people—where have they
  gone now, those proud and self-assured words?”
'23': >-
  “Let the taunts that ‘he is a coward’ be heard; he who lives in disgrace is
  worthy of condemnation. Follow the path trodden by the good; let fear be
  abandoned.”
'24': >-
  “Either we shall lie slain upon the earth, our span of life made small, and
  attain Brahma’s world—hard to reach for evil fighters,”
'25': >-
  “Or we shall win fame by slaying the enemy in battle; or, if slain, O vanaras,
  we shall enjoy the riches of the heroes’ world.”
'26': >-
  “Kumbhakarna will not depart alive after beholding Kakutstha (Rama)—as a moth,
  approaching a blazing fire, does not survive.”
'27': >-
  “By flight we may preserve our lives—but, routed by a single foe though we are
  many, our glory will go to ruin.”
'28': >-
  As that heroic Angada—wearing golden armlets—spoke thus, those who were
  fleeing then replied to him with words condemned by the brave:
'29': >-
  “A dreadful slaughter has been wrought upon us by Kumbhakarna the rakshasa.
  This is neither the place nor the time to stand; we go—dear indeed to us is
  life.”
'30': >-
  Having said only so much, all of them fled in the directions; for, seeing that
  terrible, dreadful-eyed one advancing, the leaders of the vanara troops were
  afraid.
'31': >-
  But as those heroes were running, the mighty-armed Angada, by consolations and
  by reasoned assurances, turned them all back.
'32': >-
  Brought to renewed exhilaration by the wise son of Vali, all the leaders of
  the vanara troops stood firm again, awaiting commands.
'33': >-
  Rishabha, Sharabha, Mainda, Dhumra, Nila, Kumuda, Sushena, Gavaksha, Rambha,
  Tara, Dvivida, Panasa, and foremost among them the son of Vayu—moving with all
  speed—advanced facing the battle.
'34': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-sixth canto, called “The Re-ordering and Rallying of the
  Vanara Hosts,” in the Yuddha-kanda of the revered Valmiki Ramayana, the
  Adi-kavya.
