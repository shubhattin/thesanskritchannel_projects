  Now begins the seventieth canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, named “Bharata’s Departure.”
'1': >-
  While Bharata was thus speaking of his dream, those messengers—wearied in body
  and with their mounts exhausted—entered that lovely city of the royal palace,
  difficult to approach with its formidable moats and defenses.
'2': >-
  Having met the king and been duly honored by the prince, they clasped the
  king’s feet in reverence and then spoke these words to Bharata.
'3': >-
  “The royal priest inquires of your welfare, and all the ministers as well.
  Hurry and set forth at once; an urgent matter must be attended to by you.”
'4': >-
  “Receive these most precious garments and ornaments, O large-eyed prince, and
  have them bestowed also upon your maternal uncle.”
'5': >-
  “Here are twenty koṭis (crores) belonging to your maternal uncle, O lord of
  men; and likewise, O prince, ten koṭis in full as well.”
'6': >-
  Having accepted all of that, and being warmly disposed toward his well-wishers
  and friends, Bharata addressed the messengers, honoring them duly with such
  comforts and gifts as they desired.
'7': >-
  “Is the king—my father Daśaratha—indeed in good health? And is there no
  ill-will toward Rāma, or toward the great-souled Lakṣmaṇa?”
'8': >-
  “And is noble Kauśalyā—devoted to dharma, knowing dharma, and ever beholding
  what is righteous—the mother of wise Rāma, free from disease as well?”
'9': >-
  “And is Sumitrā, the knower of dharma—the mother of Lakṣmaṇa and of the
  valiant Śatrughna—also healthy, she who is the middle (among the queens)?”
'10': >-
  “And is Kaikeyī—ever self-willed, harsh, quick to anger, proud of her own
  understanding—also free from illness? What, indeed, did my mother say?”
'11': >-
  Thus questioned by the great-souled Bharata, the messengers then spoke to him
  these words, humbly and with due deference.
'12': >-
  “All those of whom you inquire are well, O tiger among men. And
  prosperity—Lotus-born Śrī—chooses you; and may your rākṣa (protection and
  well-being) also be secured.”
'13': >-
  And Bharata, thus addressed, spoke to the messengers: “I take leave of the
  great king (my grandfather), for the messengers are urging me to haste.”
'14': >-
  Having spoken thus to the messengers, Bharata, the king’s son, prompted on by
  them, then spoke these words to his maternal grandfather.
'15': >-
  “O King, urged on by the messengers, I shall go into the presence of my
  father. Yet I shall return again, whenever you remember me and call me to
  mind.”
'16': >-
  When Bharata had spoken thus, the king—his maternal grandfather—then spoke
  auspicious words to him, kissing the Rāghava upon the head.
'17': >-
  “Go, my child; I grant you leave. May Kaikeyī be blessed with good offspring
  through you. Convey my greetings of welfare to your mother, and to your father
  as well, O best of ascetics (in endurance).”
'18': >-
  “Convey welfare also to the royal priest, and to the other foremost
  twice-born; and to those two great archers, your brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa,
  my child.”
'19': >-
  Then Kaikeya (your grandfather), having honored him greatly, gave wealth to
  Bharata—excellent elephants, variegated blankets, and hides—as a gift of
  farewell.
'20': >-
  And having honored Kaikeyī’s son, the king of Kekaya ordered further wealth to
  be given: two thousand golden neck-ornaments (niṣkas) and sixteen hundred
  horses.
'21': >-
  Likewise he quickly bestowed upon Bharata ministers of his choosing—trusted
  men endowed with virtues—to go as his attendants and followers.
'22': >-
  His maternal uncle also gave him wealth: pleasing-to-behold elephants like
  Airāvata, with mighty temples, and swift, well-harnessed mules.
'23': >-
  And he gave as a present great dogs, reared within the inner
  apartments—endowed with the strength and valor of tigers, with mighty bodies,
  and bearing their fangs as weapons.
'24': >-
  Taking leave of his maternal grandfather and of his maternal uncle Yudhājit,
  Bharata mounted his chariot and set forth, accompanied by Śatrughna.
'25': >-
  Then a very great anxiety arose in his heart—both because of the haste of the
  messengers, and because of the vision of that dream.
'26': >-
  Passing beyond his own residence—thronged with men, elephants, and horses—the
  exceedingly splendid prince came upon the unsurpassed royal highway.
'27': >-
  Proceeding onward, that noble-minded one beheld the inner palace; and then the
  illustrious Bharata entered it, unrestrained and without being stopped.
'28': >-
  Having taken leave of his maternal grandfather and of his maternal uncle
  Yudhājit, Bharata mounted his chariot and departed, accompanied by Śatrughna.
'29': >-
  After harnessing more than a hundred chariots furnished with circular rims and
  wheels, servants followed after Bharata as he went—provided with camels,
  cattle, horses, and mules.
'30': >-
  Guarded by an army, the great-souled Bharata—accompanied by ministers equal to
  himself and to Āryaka (his elder/grandfather), taking Śatrughna with him, his
  foes driven away—departed from the house like Indra setting forth from the
  world of the Siddhas.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the seventieth canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the venerable, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki—the First Poem—entitled “Bharata’s Departure.”
