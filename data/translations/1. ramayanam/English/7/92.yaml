'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninety-second canto, called “The Guarding and Course of the Sacrificial
  Horse.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon, Bharata’s elder brother (Rāma), having swiftly made every
  arrangement in full, released that horse—endowed with all auspicious marks,
  and dark as the black antelope—according to rite.
'2': >-
  And, having appointed Lakṣmaṇa—together with the officiating priests—to the
  discipline and guarding of the horse-rite, the son of Kakutstha then proceeded
  to Naimiṣa with his army.
'3': >-
  Beholding that wondrous sacrificial enclosure, the mighty-armed and
  illustrious one obtained an unsurpassed joy, and spoke these words:
'4': >-
  While he dwelt at Naimiṣa, all the kings came there and brought offerings; and
  Rāma duly honoured and received them.
'5': >-
  And the wise and best of men issued commands that the great-souled kings,
  together with their followers, should be worthily served with suitable
  honours.
'6': >-
  Then Bharata, together with Śatrughna, promptly distributed food and drink and
  garments to those great-souled rulers and to all their attendants.
'7': >-
  And then the great-souled Vānaras, together with Sugrīva, all bowed down in
  reverence to the Brāhmaṇas and busied themselves in serving and distributing
  portions.
'8': >-
  And Vibhīṣaṇa, surrounded by many Rākṣasas adorned with garlands, rendered
  worship to the great-souled sages of fierce austerities.
'9': >-
  Thus well-ordered, the Aśvamedha sacrifice proceeded; and the guarding and
  ranging of the horse went on, protected by Lakṣmaṇa. Such was the supreme and
  excellent best of sacrifices belonging to that lion among kings.
'10': >-
  No other cry was heard there in that Aśvamedha of the great-souled king, save
  this: “Give, according to desire—freely—until the petitioners are satisfied!”
'11': >-
  So long, within the midst of that sacrifice of the great-souled king, were all
  manner of gifts bestowed—various sweetmeats and confections, and also
  preparations of sugar-cane and the like.
'12': >-
  Before ever a word could fully issue from the lips of the supplicants, gifts
  were seen to have been already given—by the Vānaras and by the Rākṣasas.
'13': >-
  There, in that excellent sacrifice of the king—thronged with delighted and
  well-nourished people—no one was seen to be unclean, nor poor, nor even worn
  down by emaciation.
'14': >-
  And those great-souled sages there, long-lived ascetics, did not remember
  (having seen) such a sacrifice; nor indeed had it ever happened so at any
  time.
'15': >-
  He who sought to accomplish a duty with gold obtained gold; the seeker of
  wealth obtained wealth; and the seeker of jewels obtained jewels alone.
'16': >-
  And heaps were continually seen—of silver, of gold, of precious stones, and of
  garments—being given without cease.
'17': >-
  “Neither in the treasure of Śakra (Indra), nor of the Lord of Wealth (Kubera),
  nor of Yama, nor of Varuṇa have we seen anything like this,”—so spoke those
  ascetics rich in penance.
'18': >-
  Everywhere stood the Vānaras, and everywhere indeed the Rākṣasas; with hands
  filled to the full, they gave greatly—food and wealth—to the petitioners.
'19': >-
  Such was this sacrifice of the lion among kings, endowed with every
  excellence: it continued for a full year and more, and did not diminish.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-second canto, called “The Guarding and Course of the
  Sacrificial Horse,” in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primeval epic.
