  Then, in the revered Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-fifth canto, called “The Command to Abandon Sītā.”
'1': >-
  When all of them had taken their seats, and the hearts of all were cast down
  with sorrow, the Kakutstha (Rāma) spoke these words, his mouth grown dry (with
  grief and anguish).
'2': >-
  “All of you, listen—may welfare be yours. Do not set your minds otherwise.
  Such, indeed, is the tale that is current among the citizens concerning my
  Sītā.”
'3': >-
  “A very great reproach of the townsmen—and of the countryside as well—prevails
  regarding me; it is loathsome, and it rends my very vitals.”
'4': >-
  “I, indeed, am born in the illustrious lineage of the great-souled Ikṣvākus;
  and Sītā also is born in a noble house—the lineage of the great-souled
  Janakas.”
'5': >-
  “You know, gentle one, how in the wilderness—within the lonely forest of
  Daṇḍaka—Sītā was carried off by Rāvaṇa, and how he was destroyed by me.”
'6': >-
  “Thereupon this thought arose in me concerning the daughter of Janaka: ‘Having
  had this Sītā dwell there (in another’s place), how may I bring her into the
  city?’”
'7': >-
  “Then, for the sake of assurance (and proof), Sītā entered the blazing fire at
  that time, in your very presence, Saumitre (Lakṣmaṇa). The Fire-god, the
  bearer of oblations, openly declared Maithilī to be sinless; and Vāyu also,
  moving through the sky, (bore witness).”
'8': >-
  “And the Moon and the Sun likewise proclaimed—formerly, in the presence of the
  gods—and in the presence of all the sages as well, that the daughter of Janaka
  was free from sin.”
'9': >-
  “Thus, of purified conduct, in the presence of gods and Gandharvas, on the
  island of Laṅkā, she was placed into my hand by great Indra himself.”
'10': >-
  “And my own inner self knows Sītā—the glorious one—to be pure. Therefore,
  taking Vaidehī, I came to Ayodhyā.”
'11': >-
  “Yet this mighty outcry and grief abide within my heart—the very great
  reproach of the townsmen, and of the realm as well.”
'12': >-
  “For whatever person’s ill-fame is sung in the world, he falls into the most
  wretched of worlds, so long as that report continues to be spoken.”
'13': >-
  “Ill-fame is censured even by the gods; fame is honored in the worlds. And for
  the sake of fame, undertaking (hard acts) is made by all the greatly noble.”
'14': >-
  “I might even abandon my life—or even you, O best of men—out of fear of
  reproach; how much more, then, the daughter of Janaka!”
'15': >-
  “Therefore, behold me fallen into an ocean of sorrow; for I do not see any
  suffering greater than this.”
'16': >-
  “Tomorrow at dawn, Saumitre, mount the chariot placed under Sumantra’s charge;
  placing Sītā upon it, abandon her at the border of the realm.”
'17': >-
  “On the farther bank of the Gaṅgā is the hermitage of the great-souled
  Vālmīki, radiant as something divine, resting by the bank of the Tamasā.”
'18': >-
  “There, in a solitary place, leave her, O delighter of the Raghus; then return
  swiftly—may good be yours. Do my command.”
'19': >-
  “And in this matter no reply is to be made to me in any way concerning Sītā.
  Therefore go, Saumitre; no deliberation is to be done here.”
'20': >-
  “For if you obstruct this, extreme displeasure will be mine; for you have been
  bound by me—as it were by a curse—by my arms and by my very life.”
'21': >-
  “Those who, by speaking otherwise than my words, would in any way try to
  dissuade me—those are ever called unfriendly, since they thwart what I
  desire.”
'22': >-
  “If you honor me, standing within my command, then today let Sītā be taken
  away from here. Do my word.”
'23': >-
  “Formerly, she told me: ‘I would see the hermitages on the bank of the Gaṅgā.’
  Let this her wish be brought to fulfillment now.”
'24': >-
  Having spoken thus, the Kakutstha, his face covered with tears, that
  righteous-souled lord entered (within), surrounded by his brothers.
'25': His heart fastened upon sorrow, he heaved sighs like an elephant.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the forty-fifth canto, named “The Command to Abandon Sītā,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Primeval Epic.
