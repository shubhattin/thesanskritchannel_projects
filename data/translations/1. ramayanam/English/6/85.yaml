  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  eighty-fifth chapter, called “The March to Nikumbhilā.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words spoken by that rākṣasa, Rāghava, worn down by grief, could
  not clearly take in and grasp what had been said by him.
'2': >-
  Then Rāma, the conqueror of enemy cities, steadying himself with fortitude,
  spoke to Vibhīṣaṇa who sat near him, in the presence of the vānaras.
'3': >-
  “O Vibhīṣaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, I wish to hear again the words that were
  spoken to you. Tell me what you intend to say.”
'4': >-
  Having heard Rāghava’s words, Vibhīṣaṇa—skilled in speech—then spoke again
  those very words.
'5': >-
  “As you commanded, O mighty-armed one, regarding the encampment of the
  detachments—so indeed, O hero, it has been carried out immediately upon your
  instruction.”
'6': >-
  “All those forces have been divided all around, and the troop-leaders too have
  been stationed in due order, according to their proper divisions.”
'7': >-
  “And further, O great lord, hear what I have to submit. When you are afflicted
  without cause, we are afflicted at heart.”
'8': >-
  “Abandon this sorrow, O king—this torment that has arisen in vain. Let this
  anxiety be cast away, for it increases the joy of the enemy.”
'9': >-
  “Let effort be undertaken, O hero; let cheer be embraced. If Sītā is to be
  regained by you, then the night-rangers must be slain.”
'10': >-
  “O delight of the Raghu line, I shall speak; listen to my beneficial counsel.
  Let Saumitri go forth well—surrounded by a great host.”
'11': >-
  “Having reached Nikumbhilā, let the great battle-archer slay Rāvaṇa’s son in
  combat, with arrows released from the circle of the bow, like venom comparable
  to that of poisonous serpents.”
'12': >-
  “Let that mighty bowman, the conqueror of battles, slay Rāvaṇa’s son with
  arrows. For by the austerity of that hero, and by a boon from the Self-born
  Brahmā himself, he has obtained the weapon called Brahmaśiras; and he
  possesses steeds that go at will.”
'13': >-
  “Indeed, he has, with his army, reached Nikumbhilā. If he should rise up after
  accomplishing his rite, know that all of us are slain.”
'14': >-
  “But if the enemy is reached at Nikumbhilā before the sacred fire-rite is
  completed, then—O Indra’s foe—if he would strike you, the assailant, that will
  be his death.”
'15': >-
  “Such indeed is the boon granted by the Lord of all the worlds, O mighty-armed
  one. Thus, O king, has the death of that intelligent one been ordained in this
  manner.”
'16': >-
  “Therefore, O Rāma, command the mighty force for the slaying of Indrajit. When
  he is slain, know Rāvaṇa too to be slain, along with the circle of his
  friends.”
'17': >-
  Hearing Vibhīṣaṇa’s words, Rāma then spoke: “I know the sorcery of that fierce
  one, O you whose prowess is true.”
'18': >-
  “For he is skilled in Brahmā-weapons, wise, possessed of great illusion and
  great strength; in battle he renders senseless even the gods, along with
  Varuṇa.”
'19': >-
  “As he moves through the sky upon his chariot, O greatly renowned one, his
  course cannot be discerned—like the sun when the heavens are overwhelmed by
  masses of clouds.”
'20': >-
  But Rāghava, understanding the power of illusion and prowess of that
  wicked-souled enemy, spoke these words to Lakṣmaṇa, endowed with glory:
