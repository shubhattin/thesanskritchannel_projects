  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  thirteenth chapter, called “The Commendation of Mahāpārśva’s Words.”
'1': >-
  Knowing that Rāvaṇa was enraged, Mahāpārśva, mighty in strength, reflected for
  a moment, and then, with joined palms, spoke these words:
'2': >-
  He who, having reached the forest frequented by deer and wild beasts, would
  not drink honey when it has been obtained—such a man would indeed be deemed
  childish and foolish.
'3': >-
  Who is there that is the lord over the Lord—over you, O subduer of enemies?
  Take your delight with Vaidehī, after trampling your foes beneath your feet
  and striking them down.
'4': >-
  Proceed with force, in the manner of a cock’s boldness, O great and powerful
  one; assailing and assailing, enjoy that Sītā indeed—partake of her and revel.
'5': >-
  When your desire is fulfilled, what fear can come to you thereafter? Whether
  it be what has arrived or what is yet untimely, you will be able to meet and
  counter everything.
'6': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa along with us, and Indrajit too, mighty of strength—both are
  capable of repelling even the thunderbolt-bearing Indra, even with his vajra.
'7': >-
  Setting aside the granting of gifts, conciliation, or even sowing
  dissension—measures devised by the skilful—I approve the gaining of objectives
  here by punishment and force.
'8': >-
  Here, all these enemies who have come against you, O mighty-armed one—we shall
  bring under control by the power of weapons; of this there is no doubt.
'9': >-
  Thus addressed then by Mahāpārśva, King Rāvaṇa, honoring his words, spoke this
  reply:
'10': >-
  Mahāpārśva, listen to a certain secret of mine. I shall relate to you an old
  occurrence—something that once befell me.
'11': >-
  I saw Puñjikāsthalā going to the abode of the Grandsire (Brahmā), being tossed
  about in the sky like a flame’s crest of fire.
'12': >-
  I forcibly enjoyed her, and then made her naked; thereafter she reached the
  abode of the Self-born (Brahmā), trembling and shaken like a lotus-plant.
'13': >-
  And this, I deem, was known to that great-souled one (Brahmā) exactly as it
  had occurred. Then the Creator, angered, spoke these words to me:
'14': >-
  ‘From this day onward, if you approach any other woman by force, then your
  head shall split into a hundred pieces—of this there is no doubt.’
'15': >-
  Therefore, fearing that curse of his, I do not, by sheer force, place Vaidehī
  Sītā upon my auspicious bed, nor make her mount it against her will.
'16': >-
  My impetuosity is like the ocean’s surge; my speed is like the Wind-god’s
  course. Dāśarathi Rāma does not know this; and it is for that reason that he
  advances against me.
'17': >-
  For who would wish to awaken a lion lying asleep in a mountain-cave—or Death
  himself, seated there—when enraged?
'18': >-
  Rāma does not behold in battle my arrows once loosed—two-tongued like
  serpents; and therefore he comes forth against me.
'19': >-
  Swiftly, with thunderbolt-like arrows, shot from the bow by the hundred, I
  shall set Rāma ablaze, as with firebrands one would inflame an elephant.
'20': >-
  And I shall strip away his strength, being surrounded by my great force—just
  as the risen sun at the proper time takes away the radiance of the stars.
'21': >-
  Not even together with Vāsava (Indra) of a thousand eyes, nor again with
  Varuṇa, is it possible to contend with me in battle. By the might of my arms,
  this city was formerly conquered by me—this city once protected by Vaiśravaṇa
  (Kubera).
'22': >-
  Thus ends the thirteenth chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Commendation of Mahāpārśva’s
  Words.”
