  Now begins, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the First
  Sarga, named “The Meeting with the Great Seers.”
'1': >-
  Having entered the great forest—the Daṇḍaka forest—Rāma, self-possessed and of
  irresistible prowess, beheld the circle of hermitages of the ascetics.
'2': >-
  Encircled with kuśa-grass and bark-garments, and enclosed by holy splendour
  befitting Brahman, it was difficult to gaze upon—like the orb of the sun
  blazing in the sky.
'3': >-
  It was a refuge for all beings, with its courtyard ever well-swept and kept
  clean; it was thronged with many deer and encompassed by flocks of birds.
'4': >-
  It was constantly honoured and attended, and ever graced by companies of
  Apsarases who performed worshipful dances; and it was furnished with spacious
  fire-altars, ladles and sacrificial vessels, deer-skins, and kuśa-grass.
'5': >-
  Adorned with bundles of fuel-sticks, water-pots, and with fruits and roots;
  and surrounded by forest-great trees—holy, bearing sweet fruits.
'6': >-
  Made sacred by offerings, oblations, and worship, and resounding with the
  solemn chant of the Vedas; strewn all around with flowers of many kinds, and
  embellished with lotus-ponds bearing lotuses.
'7': >-
  It was inhabited by disciplined sages whose food was fruits and roots, who
  were self-restrained, clad in bark-garments and black antelope-skins; and by
  ancient munis who shone like the sun and like the fire Vaiśvānara.
'8': >-
  It was made splendid by supreme seers—holy men of regulated diet; it appeared
  like the very abode of Brahmā, and echoed with the reverberation of Vedic
  recitation.
'9': >-
  It was further adorned by fortunate Brāhmaṇas who were knowers of Brahman.
  Beholding that circle of ascetics’ hermitages, the illustrious Rāghava—endowed
  with prosperity—drew near.
'10': >-
  The great-tejā Rāma approached, having strung his mighty bow. Those great
  seers, possessed of divine knowledge, upon seeing Rāma,
'11': >-
  came forward then with gladness to meet him, and also the illustrious Vaidehī.
  Seeing the righteous one—like the moon rising—those sages,
'12': >-
  and seeing Lakṣmaṇa too, and Vaidehī the renowned, they uttered auspicious
  benedictions and received them—men firm in their vows.
'13': >-
  The forest-dwelling ascetics, their looks filled with wonder, beheld Rāma’s
  beauty of form and build, his radiance, his tenderness, and his excellent
  attire.
'14': >-
  With eyes as though unblinking, all those forest-dwellers gazed upon Vaidehī,
  upon Lakṣmaṇa, and upon Rāma—marvelling as at a wondrous sight.
'15': >-
  Thereupon those highly fortunate ones, devoted to the welfare of all beings,
  seated Rāghava—an honoured guest—in a leaf-hut.
'16': >-
  Then, having duly honoured Rāma according to the proper rite, those
  illustrious sages—like fire in brilliance and devoted to righteousness—brought
  water for him.
'17': >-
  Uttering auspicious blessings, filled with supreme joy, they presented roots,
  flowers, and all manner of fruits, and whatever belonged to the great-souled
  one’s hermitage.
'18': >-
  Having thus offered these, those knowers of dharma, with hands joined in
  reverence, spoke: “Thou art the guardian of the dharma of this people, a
  refuge to all, and of great renown.
'19': >-
  A king, bearing the rod of punishment, is to be honoured and revered—he is a
  guru. Even as one portion of Indra, O Rāghava, he protects the subjects.
'20': >-
  Therefore the king, being saluted, enjoys excellent and delightful royal
  pleasures. We who dwell within thy realm are to be protected by thee—whether
  we abide in the city or in the forest. Thou art our king, O lord of men.
'21': >-
  We have laid aside punishment, O King; we have conquered anger and subdued the
  senses. Yet we, rich in austerity, must ever be protected by thee, as though
  we were within the womb (helpless and dependent).”
'22': >-
  Having spoken thus, they honoured Rāghava with fruits and roots, with other
  flowers, and with various kinds of forest fare—together with Lakṣmaṇa.
'23': >-
  So also other ascetics, accomplished and perfected, resembling Vaiśvānara in
  splendour, living by righteousness, in due manner satisfied that lord (Rāma)
  with what was proper.
'24': >-
  Thus ends the First Sarga, named “The Meeting with the Great Seers,” in the
  Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
