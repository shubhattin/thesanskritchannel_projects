'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (Paramātman).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': 'Now, the Third Chapter: Karma-yoga (the Yoga of Action).'
'3': 'Arjuna said:'
'4': >-
  If, O Janārdana, knowledge (buddhi) is held by You to be superior to action,
  then why, O Keśava, do You urge me to engage in this dreadful action (battle)?
'5': >-
  With speech as though mixed and perplexing, You seem to bewilder my
  understanding; therefore, tell me decisively that one path by which I may
  attain the Highest good (śreyas).
'6': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'7': >-
  In this world, O sinless one, a twofold steadfast discipline was declared by
  Me in former times: the path of knowledge (jñāna-yoga) for the Sāṅkhyas (those
  devoted to discernment), and the path of action (karma-yoga) for the yogins
  (those devoted to selfless work).
'8': >-
  Not by abstaining from the undertaking of actions does a man attain
  actionlessness (naiṣkarmya); nor does he reach perfection merely by
  renunciation (saṃnyāsa).
'9': >-
  For no one can ever remain even for a moment without performing action;
  indeed, everyone is helplessly made to act by the guṇas born of Prakṛti
  (material nature).
'10': >-
  He who restrains the organs of action, yet sits brooding in the mind on the
  objects of the senses—such a deluded soul is called a hypocrite, one of false
  conduct.
'11': >-
  But he who, O Arjuna, restraining the senses with the mind, undertakes the
  yoga of action through the organs of action, without attachment—he excels.
'12': >-
  Perform your prescribed duty; for action is superior to inaction. Even the
  maintenance of your body would not be possible through inaction.
'13': >-
  Except for action done for the sake of sacrifice (yajña), this world is bound
  by action; therefore, O son of Kuntī, perform action for that purpose, free
  from attachment.
'14': >-
  Having created beings together with sacrifice, Prajāpati (the Lord of
  creatures) said of old: ‘By this shall you prosper; let this be to you the
  wish-fulfilling cow (granting desired enjoyments).’
'15': >-
  Nourish the devas by this (sacrifice), and may those devas nourish you; thus,
  nourishing one another, you shall attain the highest good.
'16': >-
  For the devas, nourished by sacrifice, will indeed grant you the desired
  enjoyments; but he who enjoys what is given by them without offering (in
  return) to them—he is verily a thief.
'17': >-
  The righteous, who eat the remnants of sacrifice, are freed from all sins; but
  those sinful ones who cook only for their own sake eat sin.
'18': >-
  From food beings come forth; from rain arises the production of food; from
  sacrifice comes rain; and sacrifice arises from action.
'19': >-
  Know that action is born of Brahman; Brahman is born of the Imperishable
  (Akṣara). Therefore the all-pervading Brahman is eternally established in
  sacrifice.
'20': >-
  He who does not follow here the wheel thus set in motion—living in sin,
  delighting in the senses—he lives in vain, O Pārtha.
'21': >-
  But the man who rejoices only in the Self, is satisfied with the Self, and is
  contented in the Self alone—for him there is no duty to be done.
'22': >-
  For him there is no gain at all from what is done, nor any loss from what is
  not done; and he does not depend on any being whatsoever for any purpose.
'23': >-
  Therefore, being without attachment, always perform the work that is to be
  done; for, performing action without attachment, a man attains the Supreme.
'24': >-
  Indeed, Janaka and others attained perfection through action alone; and even
  with a view to the maintenance of the world (lokasaṅgraha), you ought to act.
'25': >-
  Whatever a श्रेष्ठ (excellent) person does, that the common people do
  likewise; whatever standard he sets, the world follows.
'26': >-
  For Me, O Pārtha, there is nothing whatsoever that must be done in the three
  worlds; nor is there anything unattained that must be attained; yet I continue
  in action.
'27': >-
  For if I did not ever engage in action unwearied, O Pārtha, men would in every
  way follow My path.
'28': >-
  These worlds would perish if I did not perform action; and I would become the
  cause of confusion of castes (saṅkara), and would destroy these beings.
'29': >-
  As the ignorant act with attachment to action, O Bhārata, so should the wise
  act without attachment, desiring the welfare and cohesion of the world
  (lokasaṅgraha).
'30': >-
  Let him not create confusion in the understanding of the ignorant who are
  attached to action; rather, the wise man, being disciplined, should cause them
  to engage joyfully in all actions, while himself performing them rightly.
'31': >-
  All actions are in every way performed by the guṇas of Prakṛti; but he whose
  self is deluded by egoism thinks, ‘I am the doer.’
'32': >-
  But he who knows the truth, O mighty-armed one, regarding the distinctions of
  guṇas and actions—understanding that ‘the guṇas move among the guṇas’—does not
  become attached.
'33': >-
  Those bewildered by the guṇas of Prakṛti become attached to the actions of the
  guṇas; the man of perfect knowledge should not disturb those dull-witted ones
  of incomplete understanding.
'34': >-
  Renouncing all actions in Me, with the mind intent on the Self, free from
  longing and free from possessiveness, fight—without fever (without inner
  agitation).
'35': >-
  Those men who constantly practice this teaching of Mine, endowed with faith
  and not cavilling—those too are freed from the bondage of actions.
'36': >-
  But those who, finding fault, do not practice this teaching of Mine—know them
  to be deluded in all knowledge, devoid of discernment, and ruined.
'37': >-
  Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature; beings follow their
  nature. What will restraint accomplish?
'38': >-
  Attraction and aversion are fixed with regard to each sense and its object;
  one should not come under the sway of those two, for they are his enemies and
  obstacles.
'39': >-
  Better is one’s own dharma, though lacking in merit, than the dharma of
  another well performed. Better is death in one’s own dharma; the dharma of
  another is fraught with fear.
'40': 'Arjuna said:'
'41': >-
  Then by what is a man impelled to commit sin, O Vārṣṇeya, even unwillingly, as
  if driven by force?
'42': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'43': >-
  It is desire; it is anger—born of the guṇa of rajas; all-devouring, greatly
  sinful. Know this here to be the enemy.
'44': >-
  As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as an embryo is covered
  by the womb—so is this covered by that.
'45': >-
  Knowledge is enveloped by this constant enemy of the wise, O son of Kuntī,
  taking the form of desire—insatiable as fire.
'46': >-
  The senses, the mind, and the intellect are said to be its seat; through these
  it deludes the embodied one by veiling knowledge.
'47': >-
  Therefore, O best of the Bhāratas, first restraining the senses, slay this
  sinful one—this destroyer of knowledge and realized wisdom (jñāna and
  vijñāna).
'48': >-
  They say the senses are superior (to the body); superior to the senses is the
  mind; superior to the mind is the intellect; but He (the Self) is superior
  even to the intellect.
'49': >-
  Thus, knowing That which is higher than the intellect, and steadying the self
  by the Self, slay, O mighty-armed one, this enemy in the form of desire, hard
  to overcome.
'50': >-
  Om Tat Sat—thus, in the Upaniṣads of the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, in the science
  of Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna,
  ends the Third Chapter, entitled ‘Karma-yoga’ (the Yoga of Action).
