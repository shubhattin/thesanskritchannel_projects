  Now begins the forty-third canto in the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Burning of the Sacred Shrine (Caitya-prāsāda).”
'1': >-
  Then Hanumān, having slain the kinkaras, stood absorbed in thought: “By me the
  grove has been shattered, yet the sacred shrine has not been destroyed.”
'2': >-
  “Therefore, this very day I shall demolish this palace-shrine.” Thus
  resolving, Hanumān, displaying his might in his mind, set himself to the task.
'3': >-
  Leaping up to the caitya-prāsāda, lofty like the peak of Meru, Hanumān—best of
  the monkeys, the son of Māruta—climbed upon it.
'4': >-
  Mounting that palace, vast as a mountain, that leader of the monkey-host,
  blazing with great splendour, shone forth like the risen sun.
'5': >-
  Assailing that elevated, hard-to-approach shrine-palace with fearless prowess,
  Hanumān, radiant with fortune, appeared like the Pāriyātra mountain.
'6': >-
  Becoming of exceedingly vast form, that powerful son of Māruta boldly snapped
  his fingers, filling Laṅkā with the sound.
'7': >-
  By that great finger-snap—loud and striking to the ears—birds there fell down,
  and the guardians of the shrine were stunned and bewildered.
'8': >-
  “Rāma is victorious—Rāma who is supreme among those skilled in weapons! Mighty
  Lakṣmaṇa is victorious! King Sugrīva is victorious, protected by Rāghava!”
'9': >-
  “I am the servant of Rāma, lord of Kosala, whose actions are untiring. I am
  Hanumān, son of Māruta, the slayer of the enemy’s armies!”
'10': >-
  “Not even a thousand Rāvaṇas would prove a match for me in battle, even as I
  strike with rocks and with trees by the thousand!”
'11': >-
  “Having humbled the city of Laṅkā and having paid homage to Maithilī, I shall
  depart with my purpose fulfilled, while all the rākṣasas look on!”
'12': >-
  Thus speaking, that colossal leader of the monkey-host, standing upon the
  shrine, roared with a dreadful reverberation, causing fear among the rākṣasas.
'13': >-
  By that mighty roar, a hundred shrine-guardians rushed forth, taking up
  various weapons—spears, swords, and battle-axes.
'14': >-
  Hurling themselves forward, those huge-bodied ones surrounded Māruti; they
  came armed with diverse maces, iron clubs, and golden armlets.
'15': >-
  They advanced upon the best of monkeys with arrows resembling the sun—like the
  vast, mighty swirl of the waters of the Gaṅgā.
'16': >-
  Encircling the foremost of monkeys, that troop of rākṣasas appeared all around
  him. Then the son of the Wind, enraged, assumed a terrible form.
'17': >-
  Tearing out with force a great pillar of that palace—adorned with
  gold—Hanumān, the son of Māruta, wrenched it free with speed.
'18': >-
  Then that mighty one whirled it about, the pillar streaming in a hundred
  lines; and thereupon fire arose, and the palace too began to burn.
'19': >-
  Seeing that palace aflame, the leader of the monkey-host slew a hundred
  rākṣasas—like Indra with his thunderbolt slaying the asuras.
'20': >-
  Then the illustrious one, stationed in the sky, spoke these words: “Thousands
  like me—great-souled ones—have been dispatched.
'21': >-
  Powerful lords of monkeys, obedient to Sugrīva’s command—both we and other
  vānaras—range over the entire earth.
'22': >-
  Some possess the strength of ten elephants; some are tenfold stronger than
  that; some are equal in valour to a thousand elephants.
'23': >-
  Some have the strength of a mighty flood; some are comparable to the force of
  the wind; some possess immeasurable strength—such leaders of monkey-hosts are
  there.
'24': >-
  Surrounded by such monkeys, whose weapons are their teeth and nails—by
  hundreds, by hundreds of thousands, by crores, and even by tens of thousands—
'25': >-
  Sugrīva will come—the destroyer of you all. Neither will this city Laṅkā
  remain, nor you, nor even Rāvaṇa—since you have incurred enmity with that
  great-souled hero of the Ikṣvāku line.”
'26': >-
  Thus ends the forty-third canto of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the ancient epic, called “The Burning of the Sacred Shrine (Caitya-prāsāda).”
