  Then, in the glorious Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Yuddha-kanda, begins the
  Forty-third Canto, called “The Combat of Single Duels.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, while those great-souled monkeys and the rakshasas were engaged in
  fighting, a most dreadful fury of strength and wrath arose among them.
'2': >-
  Mounting horses with golden caparisons, elephants like blazing tongues of
  fire, and chariots shining like the sun—clad in splendid and delightful
  armour—
'3': >-
  those valiant rakshasas set forth, making the ten quarters resound—terrible in
  deeds, striving for Ravana’s victory.
'4': >-
  The vast host of the monkeys also, desiring triumph, rushed upon that army of
  the rakshasas, men of grim and fearful exploits.
'5': >-
  In that interval, as they ran at one another, between the rakshasas and the
  monkeys there arose a battle of single combats—duel against duel.
'6': >-
  Then Angada, the son of Vali, fought with Indrajit; and that rakshasa of great
  splendour battled him, as Andhaka once fought with Tryambaka (Shiva).
'7': >-
  Sampati engaged Prajangha, ever hard to overcome in war; and Hanuman the
  monkey set upon Jambumali.
'8': >-
  Vibhishana, the younger brother of Ravana, possessed of mighty wrath, met
  Shatrughna in battle with swift and keen onset.
'9': >-
  Nila also, of great radiance, fought in combat with the powerful rakshasa
  Nikumbha, together with the elephant named Tapana.
'10': >-
  Sugriva, lord of the monkeys, joined battle with Praghasa; and the illustrious
  Lakshmana met Virupaksha in the fight.
'11': >-
  The rakshasas Agniketu, most difficult to assail, and Rashmiketu, and also
  Suptaghna and Yajnakopa, encountered Rama in combat.
'12': >-
  Vajramushti confronted Mainda, and Ashaniprabha confronted Dvivida—thus those
  two foremost monkeys met those two exceedingly dreadful rakshasas.
'13': >-
  The grim rakshasa Pratapana, a heroic warrior hard to withstand in battle,
  fought in the fray with Nala of swift attack.
'14': >-
  That great monkey famed as Sushena, the powerful son of Dharma, fought
  together with Vidyunmali.
'15': >-
  Other terrible monkeys too, with other rakshasas, suddenly entered into duels,
  fighting along with many opponents.
'16': >-
  There took place a very great battle—tumultuous and hair-raising—between the
  heroic rakshasas and monkeys, all eager for victory.
'17': >-
  From the bodies of monkeys and rakshasas, in great quantity, hair and tufts
  were torn away; and streams of blood flowed, carrying along heaps of bodies.
'18': >-
  Indrajit, enraged, struck the warrior Angada—destroyer of enemy hosts—with his
  mace, as Shatakratu (Indra) strikes with the thunderbolt.
'19': >-
  The illustrious and swift Angada, that mighty monkey, smote with his mace
  Indrajit’s chariot—adorned with gold—together with its horses and charioteer.
'20': >-
  Sampati, struck by Prajangha with three arrows, felled Prajangha on the
  forefront of battle with an ashvakarna tree.
'21': >-
  Jambumali, standing on his chariot and very strong, pierced Hanuman in the
  breast in battle, enraged, with a spear cast from the chariot.
'22': >-
  Hanuman, son of the Wind-god, leapt onto that very chariot and swiftly crushed
  it underfoot, together with that rakshasa.
'23': >-
  Roaring, the grim Pratapana pursued Nala; and Nala swiftly struck down and
  destroyed Pratapana’s two eyes.
'24': >-
  Then the rakshasa Praghasa, swift-handed and wounded in his limbs by sharp
  arrows, seemed as though he would devour the armies; and the monkey-king
  (Sugriva) faced him.
'25': >-
  Sugriva struck that fearsome-looking rakshasa with great speed, using a
  seven-leaved tree, pressing him down amid a shower of arrows.
'26': >-
  Lakshmana struck Virupaksha with a single arrow. And the unassailable
  Agniketu, and the rakshasa Rashmiketu, and Suptaghna and Yajnakopa pierced
  Rama with their arrows.
'27': >-
  Enraged, Rama in battle severed the heads of those four with his
  arrows—terrible shafts like flaming tongues of fire.
'28': >-
  Vajramushti, struck in battle by Mainda with a blow of the fist, fell to the
  earth with his chariot and horses, like an uprooted ancient tree.
'29': >-
  In the fight, Nikumbha pierced Nila—dark as a mass of blue collyrium—with
  sharp arrows, as the sun pierces a cloud with his rays.
'30': >-
  Again, that swift-handed night-ranger Nikumbha in battle pierced Nila with a
  hundred arrows, and laughed aloud.
'31': >-
  Then Nila, like Vishnu in battle, with the very wheel of that chariot severed
  in combat the head of Nikumbha and also that of his charioteer.
'32': >-
  Dvivida too, whose blows were like the thunderbolt and the crashing lightning,
  struck Ashaniprabha with a mountain peak, before the eyes of all the
  rakshasas.
'33': >-
  Then Ashaniprabha pierced Dvivida, the lord of monkeys—who fought with trees
  in battle—with arrows that were like thunderbolts.
'34': >-
  Dvivida, his body transfixed by arrows and maddened with wrath, struck down
  Ashaniprabha with a sala tree, together with his chariot and horses.
'35': >-
  Vidyunmali, standing on his chariot, smote Sushena with arrows adorned with
  golden ornaments, and roared again and again.
'36': >-
  Seeing him upon the chariot, Sushena, foremost of monkeys, quickly hurled down
  that chariot with a huge mountain peak.
'37': >-
  But Vidyunmali the night-ranger, endowed with agility, quickly leapt down from
  the chariot and stood upon the ground, mace in hand.
'38': >-
  Then Sushena, seized with wrath, the bull among monkeys, took up a very large
  rock and rushed at the night-ranger.
'39': >-
  As Sushena charged, Vidyunmali the night-ranger struck that bull among monkeys
  swiftly on the chest with his mace.
'40': >-
  The foremost of monkeys, disregarding that dreadful blow of the mace, in the
  great battle hurled that rock silently upon his breast.
'41': >-
  Smitten by the удар of the rock, Vidyunmali the night-ranger, his heart
  crushed, fell lifeless upon the earth.
'42': >-
  Thus, by those heroic monkeys, the heroic night-rangers were crushed in those
  duels, like daityas (demons) by the dwellers of heaven.
'43': >-
  With sharp bhallas, and with maces, with spears, tomaras and iron clubs; and
  with chariots flung aside, and likewise with war-horses scattered,
'44': >-
  with maddened elephants slain, and with monkeys and rakshasas fallen, and with
  axles, wheels, yokes, and chariot-poles broken and strewn upon the ground,
'45': >-
  the battlefield became dreadful, frequented by packs of jackals. Trunks of
  headless bodies sprang up in all directions—of monkeys and rakshasas—amid that
  tumultuous crush, like a battle between gods and asuras.
'46': >-
  Though being slain by the bulls among monkeys, the night-rangers, fainting
  with the smell of blood, again with force took refuge in fierce fighting,
  longing for the setting of the Sun.
'47': >-
  Thus ends the Forty-third Canto of the Yuddha-kanda of the holy
  Valmiki-Ramayana, the primordial epic, entitled “The Combat of Single Duels.”
