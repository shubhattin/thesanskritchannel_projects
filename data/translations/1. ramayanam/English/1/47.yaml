  Now, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Bala-kanda, begins the Forty-seventh
  Canto, entitled “The Arrival at Vishala.”
'1': >-
  When her embryo had been cut into seven parts, Diti, overwhelmed with great
  sorrow, addressed Indra of the thousand eyes—invincible and hard to
  assail—with words of supplication and gentle entreaty.
'2': >-
  “Through my own offence this womb-begotten child has been divided into seven
  pieces; for, O lord of the gods, O slayer of Bala, there is no fault of yours
  in this matter.
'3': >-
  “Yet I desire a boon from you in regard to the reversal that has befallen my
  pregnancy: let those seven times seven become guardians of their allotted
  stations among the Maruts.
'4': >-
  “Let these seven groups, O dear son, roam in the heavens as masses of wind;
  let them be famed as the Maruts—divine in form—my own sons.
'5': >-
  “Let one move about in the realm of Brahma; another likewise in the world of
  Indra; and let a third, of great renown, be celebrated as ‘the divine wind.’
'6': >-
  “And the remaining four, O best of the gods, by your command, shall in due
  time range over the quarters; may good befall you—these my sons shall indeed
  do so.
'7': >-
  “And by the very name bestowed through you, they shall be renowned as
  ‘Maruts.’” Hearing Diti’s words, Indra of the thousand eyes, the destroyer of
  fortresses,
'8': >-
  with joined palms spoke this reply, O slayer of Bala: “All this shall come to
  pass exactly as you have said—of this there is no doubt.
'9': >-
  “Your sons shall roam about in forms like unto the gods; may good befall you.”
  Thus mother and son, having reached a firm resolve in that forest of
  austerities,
'10': >-
  went to the heaven of the thirty gods, O Rama—this, indeed, we have
  heard—having attained their purpose.
'11': >-
  “This is that region, O Kakutstha, which was formerly inhabited by Mahendra
  (Indra),
'12': >-
  where he attended upon Diti when her austerities had borne fruit. And from
  Ikshvaku, O tiger among men, there was born a son of supreme righteousness,
'13': >-
  from Alambusha, famed by the name Vishala; and by him, in this very place, the
  city called Vishala was founded.
'14': >-
  Vishala’s son, O Rama, was Hemachandra, of mighty strength; and after
  Hemachandra came one known as Suchandra.
'15': >-
  Suchandra’s son, O Rama, was famed as Dhumrashva; and to Dhumrashva there was
  born a son, Sṛinjaya.
'16': >-
  Sṛinjaya’s son was the illustrious and valorous Sahadeva; and Sahadeva’s son
  was Kushashva, supremely righteous.
'17': >-
  Kushashva’s son was Somadatta, of great splendor and prowess; and Somadatta’s
  son was famed as Kakutstha.
'18': >-
  His son, of great splendor, is the one who now dwells in this city—highly
  renowned and unconquerable—named Sumati.
'19': >-
  By the grace of Ikshvaku, all the kings of Vaishali have been long-lived,
  great-souled, mighty in valor, and steadfast in righteousness.
'20': >-
  “Here today we shall sleep comfortably for a single night. Tomorrow at dawn, O
  best of men, you ought to behold Janaka.”
'21': >-
  But the mighty and radiant Sumati, having heard that Vishvamitra had arrived,
  that best of kings, of great renown, came forth to greet him.
'22': >-
  Having offered him the highest honor—together with his preceptor, and with his
  kinsmen—he, with palms joined, inquired after his welfare and then spoke to
  Vishvamitra:
'23': >-
  “Blessed am I; favored am I, O sage, in that you have come within my realm. By
  obtaining your very sight, there is none more fortunate than I.”
