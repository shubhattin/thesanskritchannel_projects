  Then, in the revered Valmiki Ramayana, in the Sundara-kanda, begins the tenth
  chapter, entitled “The Vision of Mandodari.”
'1': >-
  There, as Hanuman looked about, he beheld a chief couch—marvellous and divine
  in semblance—made of crystal and adorned with precious gems.
'2': >-
  It was furnished with excellent seats inlaid with ivory and wrought with
  bright gold, and spread with exceedingly costly coverings, befitting one of
  vast wealth.
'3': >-
  And in one part of that place he saw a white, celestial canopy, beautified
  with garlands, resembling the lord of stars—the moon.
'4': >-
  Encompassed with gold, shining with the splendour of the sun, and canopied
  over with a wide-spread garland of ashoka-flowers, he saw that supreme seat.
'5': >-
  It was fanned on every side by women holding chowries of yak-tail; it was
  suffused with many kinds of perfumes, and was scented with excellent incense.
'6': >-
  It was spread with the finest coverlets, overlaid with a woollen fleece and
  skins, and was adorned on all sides with strings of exquisite flower-garlands.
'7': >-
  Upon it he saw the lord of the rakshasas, whose body was like a rain-cloud,
  whose earrings blazed brightly, whose eyes were red, whose arms were mighty,
  and who was clad in garments of great silver.
'8': >-
  His limbs were anointed with red sandal-wood, fragrant and pleasing; he
  appeared like a cloud in the evening sky, crimson-hued and endowed with
  lightning’s radiance.
'9': >-
  He was encompassed with divine ornaments, comely and able to assume forms at
  will; as he lay asleep, he seemed like Mount Mandara—clothed with trees,
  woods, and thickets.
'10': >-
  Having ceased from night-sport, adorned with splendid ornaments, beloved of
  the rakshasa maidens and a source of delight to the rakshasas, he lay there.
'11': >-
  The great monkey saw that hero—the king of the rakshasas—reclining on the
  radiant couch, having also desisted from drinking.
'12': >-
  Beholding Ravana, breathing like a great serpent, the foremost of monkeys,
  exceedingly perturbed, approached him very stealthily, as though in fear.
'13': >-
  Then, gaining an ascent and taking shelter in the inner space of the raised
  platform, the great monkey gazed upon that rakshasa-tiger, sunk in drunken
  slumber.
'14': >-
  The auspicious bed of the rakshasa-lord shone as he slept, like a great
  mountain-slope when a noble elephant has sat down upon it.
'15': >-
  The great-souled Hanuman saw the two arms of the lord of rakshasas, adorned
  with golden armlets, flung out—like Indra’s banner-staffs.
'16': >-
  Their wounds were like those made by the tips of Airavata’s tusks in the
  pressure of combat; his broad shoulders seemed as if scored by the thunderbolt
  and scarred by Vishnu’s discus.
'17': >-
  Those powerful arms were thick, evenly shaped, and well-joined; his nails and
  thumbs were auspiciously marked, and his fingers bore rings.
'18': >-
  Compact and iron-club-like, rounded and resembling elephant-trunks, those arms
  lay outstretched on the fair couch like two five-hooded serpents.
'19': >-
  They were anointed and adorned with precious sandal-wood, cool, fragrant, and
  like the hue of a hare’s blood.
'20': >-
  They were pressed and caressed by excellent women, steeped in the finest
  perfumes, and were renowned even among yakshas, nagas, gandharvas, gods, and
  danavas.
'21': >-
  The monkey beheld his arms resting upon the couch, like two great serpents
  asleep within Mount Mandara, wrathful in their might.
'22': >-
  With those two full, massive arms, the lord of rakshasas shone, resembling a
  mountain; like Mount Mandara with its two peaks.
'23': >-
  A rich fragrance went before him—the perfume of mango and punnaga blossoms
  mixed with the finest bakula—together with the savour of delicate foods and
  the scent of drink.
'24': >-
  From the great mouth of that rakshasa-king, as he lay asleep, issued his
  breath, as though filling that whole mansion.
'25': >-
  His face shone, lit by earrings, and crowned by a golden diadem wrought with
  pearls and gems, slightly slipped askew.
'26': >-
  Smeared with red sandal-paste and adorned with a splendid necklace, his broad
  and lofty chest was resplendent.
'27': >-
  His blood-red eyes were partly veiled by a pale linen cloth cast over him; and
  he was also well-covered with a costly upper garment of yellow hue.
'28': >-
  Breathing heavily like a serpent, dark as a heap of black gram, he lay like a
  great elephant asleep at the edge of the vast waters of the Ganga.
'29': >-
  Illumined in the four quarters by four golden lamps, his entire form was made
  visible—like a cloud lit up by clusters of lightning.
'30': >-
  And at the foot of that great-souled one, within the house of that lord of
  rakshasas, he saw the beloved wives of that dear consort.
'31': >-
  The leader of the monkey-host saw those women with faces bright as the moon,
  adorned with excellent earrings, their garlands and ornaments unfaded.
'32': >-
  Skilled in dance and in instrumental music, resting upon the rakshasa-king’s
  arms and lap, wearing splendid ornaments, they were seen seated there by the
  monkey.
'33': >-
  On the women’s ears he saw earrings and armlets of burnished gold, set with
  vajra and vaidurya gems, reaching to the ends of their ears.
'34': >-
  By their moonlike faces and their auspicious, graceful earrings, that aerial
  mansion shone like the sky with its multitudes of stars.
'35': >-
  Those women of the rakshasa-lord—wearied by intoxication and by amorous
  play—slept, slender-waisted, each in her own place.
'36': >-
  Another, a fair-complexioned beauty skilled in dance, lay asleep with her
  whole body placed in graceful dancing-postures and gestures, her limbs
  delicately disposed.
'37': >-
  One, clasping a veena, lay asleep and shone forth, like a lotus-plant
  scattered along a great river, clinging to a boat.
'38': >-
  Another, dark-eyed, slept with her drum held close beneath her arm; that
  lovely woman appeared like a tender mother sleeping with her little son.
'39': >-
  Another, of lovely limbs and beautiful breasts, having set aside a kettledrum,
  lay asleep—like a woman in love embracing her beloved after a long time.
'40': >-
  Another, lotus-eyed, slept clasping a veena, as though a passionate woman were
  holding fast her excellent, most beloved lover.
'41': >-
  Another, a disciplined dancer, holding a vipanchi, fell under the power of
  sleep, appearing like a fair woman who has lain down together with her lover.
'42': >-
  Another, with eyes made languid by intoxication, slept with a mridanga pressed
  to her charming, soft, full limbs that gleamed like gold.
'43': >-
  Another, slender-waisted and faultless, slept with a panava held beneath the
  noose of her arms and tucked at her side, exhausted by wine.
'44': >-
  Another, still clinging to her dindima drum, slept as though she were cuddling
  a young calf, that charming woman.
'45': >-
  One woman, lotus-petal-eyed, having taken a loud-sounding instrument and
  pressed it in the embrace of her arms, slept, deluded by intoxication.
'46': >-
  Another, having cast aside a water-pot, slept and shone—like a garland
  variegated with spring-flowers when it has been laid down after adorning.
'47': >-
  One young woman, overcome by the force of sleep, lay clasping her breasts with
  both hands—like two golden jars.
'48': >-
  Another, lotus-petal-eyed, with a face like the full moon, slept in
  wine-bewilderment, embracing another fair-hipped woman.
'49': >-
  Clasping their various, wondrous musical instruments, those noble women slept,
  pressing them against their breasts, like passionate women embracing their
  lovers.
'50': >-
  Among those women lying apart, each settled in her own place upon the
  auspicious couch, the monkey then saw one woman endowed with beauty.
'51': >-
  She was richly adorned with ornaments set with pearls and gems, as though by
  her own splendour she were adorning that excellent mansion.
'52': >-
  There the monkey saw Mandodari—fair, golden-hued, dear, the sovereign lady of
  the inner apartments—lying down, of lovely form.
'53': >-
  Beholding her—adorned and beautiful—the mighty-armed son of the Wind-god
  reasoned, “This is Sita,” judging by her beauty and the fullness of her youth;
  and the leader of the monkey-host rejoiced, filled with great delight.
'54': >-
  He snapped his fingers, kissed his tail, rejoiced, sported, sang, and moved
  about; climbing upon pillars and then leaping down to the ground, he displayed
  the natural behaviour of monkeys.
'55': >-
  Thus ends the tenth chapter of the Sundara-kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana,
  the primeval epic, entitled “The Vision of Mandodari.”
