  Now begins, in the illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the
  fifty-fifth canto, entitled “The Endeavour to Entice Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Having issued commands to eight mighty and terrible rākṣasas, Rāvaṇa—through a
  wavering of his judgment—deemed himself to have accomplished his purpose.
'2': >-
  Tormented by the arrows of desire, and brooding ever on Vaidehī, he entered
  his lovely inner mansion, hastening to behold Sītā.
'3': >-
  Entering that dwelling, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, beheld Sītā amidst
  rākṣasī women, wholly given over to sorrow.
'4': >-
  Her face filled with tears, wretched, crushed beneath the heavy burden of
  grief—like a boat sinking in the ocean, overwhelmed by the force of the winds.
'5': >-
  Like a doe separated from her herd of deer and surrounded by dogs, Sītā sat
  with downcast face; approaching her thus, the night-roamer drew near.
'6': >-
  Seeing her pitiable, helpless, and subdued by grief, the lord of rākṣasas, by
  sheer force, showed her his house, resembling the abode of the gods.
'7': >-
  It was crowded with mansions and palaces, attended by thousands of women,
  thronged with flocks of diverse birds, and furnished with many kinds of
  jewels.
'8': >-
  Its pillars—delightful to behold—were inlaid with ivory, refined gold,
  crystal, and silver, and variegated with diamond and cat’s-eye gems.
'9': >-
  Resounding with the divine sound of kettledrums, adorned with ornaments of
  heated gold, he ascended with her a wondrous stairway of gold.
'10': >-
  There were charming latticed windows of ivory and silver, and rows of palaces
  covered with nets of gold.
'11': >-
  Everywhere were floors inlaid with stucco and gems; in his own residence,
  Daśagrīva displayed these to Maithilī.
'12': >-
  He showed Sītā—still wholly intent on sorrow—ponds and lotus-tanks covered
  with flowers of many kinds.
'13': >-
  Having shown Vaidehī the entire excellent palace, that sinful-souled one spoke
  to Sītā, desiring to entice her.
'14': >-
  “There are ten crores of rākṣasas and twenty-two crores besides—excluding the
  aged and decrepit and the young among the night-rangers.
'15': >-
  Of all those dreadful in action, I am the lord, O Sītā. Each one has a
  thousand at his command, and all are set foremost to do my bidding.
'16': >-
  This whole apparatus of my sovereignty rests upon you; and my very life as
  well, O large-eyed one—dearer to me than my own breath are you.
'17': >-
  Among many excellent women that are my possession, you are their mistress, O
  Sītā. Become my wife, O beloved.
'18': >-
  Why do you hold a mind turned otherwise? Accept my words. Unite with me who am
  consumed by love; you ought to grant me your favour.
'19': >-
  This Laṅkā, a hundred yojanas in extent, is girdled by the sea; it cannot be
  violated—even by gods and asuras with Indra at their head.
'20': >-
  Not among gods, nor yakṣas, nor gandharvas, nor seers of men do I behold, in
  all the worlds, anyone who could be my equal in prowess.
'21': >-
  What will you do with Rāma—fallen from his kingdom, wretched, an ascetic, a
  foot-traveller, a mere man of little splendour?
'22': >-
  Choose me alone, O Sītā; I am a husband worthy of you. Youth is uncertain, O
  timid one—take your delight here with me.
'23': >-
  Do not set your mind, O fair-faced one, upon the sight of Rāghava. What power
  has he to come here at all, even in his desires, O Sītā?
'24': >-
  Just as the swift wind in the sky cannot be bound with cords, and the spotless
  flames of a blazing fire cannot be seized—so is it here.
'25': >-
  Among the three worlds as well, O lovely one, I do not see anyone who, by
  valour, could take you away—protected within the encircling of my arms.
'26': >-
  Rule this exceedingly great kingdom of Laṅkā. Both the gods and all beings,
  moving and unmoving—together with those like me—shall be your attendants.
'27': >-
  Sprinkled with the waters of consecration, be satisfied and revel. Whatever
  evil deed you did in former times—that has passed away through your dwelling
  in the forest.
'28': >-
  And whatever good deed you have done—receive its fruit here. Here are all
  garlands and divine fragrances, O Maithilī.
'29': >-
  And here are chief ornaments—enjoy them with me. This aerial car named
  Puṣpaka, O fair-hipped one, belonged to my brother Vaiśravaṇa.
'30': >-
  That chariot of the sky, radiant like the sun—swiftly won by me in battle—is
  vast and delightful, moving with the speed of thought.
'31': >-
  There, O Sītā, roam with me at your pleasure. Your face is like a lotus—pure
  and lovely to behold.
'32': >-
  But, O slender-waisted one, O fair-faced lady, a face afflicted by sorrow does
  not shine. While he spoke thus, that noble woman—
'33': >-
  —covering her moonlike face with the end of her garment, let gentle tears
  flow: Sītā, as though absorbed in thought, unwell, her radiance struck down by
  anxiety.
'34': >-
  Then the hero Rāvaṇa, the night-roamer, spoke these words: “Enough of
  bashfulness, O Vaidehī, for you have committed a transgression against dharma.
'35': >-
  This man is a mere rustic, O goddess—motionless and powerless—who imagines he
  will overcome you. These two feet of yours I have affectionately pressed upon
  with my head.
'36': >-
  Show me favour quickly; I am your submissive servant. These words of mine are
  vain, spoken by one who is wasting away (with desire).”
'37': >-
  And never does Rāvaṇa bow his head to any woman. Having spoken thus to
  Maithilī, Janaka’s daughter, Daśagrīva—fallen under the sway of Death—thinks,
  ‘She is mine.’
'38': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fifth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Endeavour to Entice Sītā.”
