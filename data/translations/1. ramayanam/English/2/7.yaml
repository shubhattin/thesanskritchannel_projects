  Now, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Ayodhya-kanda, begins the seventh
  sarga, called “Manthara’s Lamentation (Paridevana).”
'1': >-
  Manthara—who had been born as a maidservant among Kaikeyi’s own kinsfolk and
  had dwelt together with her—by chance ascended a palace that shone like the
  moon.
'2': >-
  From that palace Manthara looked down upon the whole of Ayodhya, with its
  royal highways freshly sprinkled with water, and with lotus and water-lily
  blossoms strewn about.
'3': >-
  She saw it adorned with costly banners and with standards, and sprinkled with
  sandal-scented water, and filled with people whose heads were newly bathed.
'4': >-
  She saw it resounding with the cries of best of twice-born Brahmins holding
  garlands and sweetmeats in their hands; its gateways of white shrines of the
  gods; and every quarter made loud with the sound of all kinds of musical
  instruments.
'5': >-
  She saw it thronged with men exulting in joy, reverberating with the chanting
  of Vedic hymns; with fine elephants and horses delighting and prancing; and
  with bulls and cows lowing loudly.
'6': >-
  Seeing Ayodhya with its rows of flags and garlands raised aloft, and with
  townsmen joyous and greatly delighted, Manthara was seized with the utmost
  astonishment.
'7': >-
  Then Manthara saw a nurse (a female attendant) standing not far away, her eyes
  opened wide with happiness and her garments of pale linen; and she questioned
  her.
'8': >-
  Endowed with overflowing joy and intent upon the matter, Manthara said: “For
  what reason does Rama’s mother bestow wealth upon the people?”
'9': >-
  “Tell me—why is there such excessive rejoicing among these people? And what
  will the king, so delighted, cause to be done?”
'10': >-
  The nurse, as though bursting with joy and filled with supreme gladness, then
  informed the hunchback of the great prosperity and honor that had come to
  Raghava (Rama).
'11': >-
  “Tomorrow, under the Pushya constellation, King Dasharatha will consecrate as
  Yuvaraja the sinless Rama of Raghava’s line, whose anger is conquered.”
'12': >-
  On hearing the nurse’s words, the hunchback at once became intolerant and
  furious; and from the palace, towering like the peak of Mount Kailasa, she
  hurried down.
'13': >-
  Burning with anger, Manthara, of evil vision, spoke these words to Kaikeyi as
  she lay upon her couch.
'14': >-
  “Rise, you foolish woman! Why do you lie asleep? Fear is coming upon you.
  Overwhelmed by a flood of calamity, you do not understand your own plight.”
'15': >-
  “In misfortune, you of fair appearance, you boast because of your good
  fortune! Yet your good fortune is fickle—like the stream of a river in the
  heat of summer.”
'16': >-
  Thus addressed with harsh words by the angry hunchback of evil sight, Kaikeyi
  fell into deep dejection.
'17': >-
  Kaikeyi said to the hunchback: “Is all well, Manthara? For I observe you with
  a downcast face, exceedingly distressed.”
'18': >-
  Hearing Kaikeyi’s sweetly worded speech, Manthara—skilled in speech—replied
  with words joined with anger.
'19': >-
  The hunchback, becoming yet more despondent, though professing herself a
  well-wisher to Kaikeyi, spoke to cast her into grief and to sow division
  against Raghava.
'20': >-
  “O Queen, an inexhaustible and most dreadful ruin directed toward your
  destruction has begun: King Dasharatha will consecrate Rama as Yuvaraja.”
'21': >-
  “I, plunged into a fathomless fear, accompanied by sorrow and grief, have come
  here for your welfare, burning as though in a fire.”
'22': >-
  “By your sorrow, O Kaikeyi, my sorrow becomes great; and by your advancement
  my advancement too would be—of this there is no doubt.”
'23': >-
  “You were born in a line of kings, and you are the chief queen of a monarch;
  how, O Queen, do you not understand the harshness of the duties and ways of
  kings?”
'24': >-
  “Your husband speaks of dharma yet is deceitful; his speech is smooth, yet he
  is cruel. In your guileless trust you fail to know him; thus you are being
  deluded by him.”
'25': >-
  “Present before you, he employs meaningless words of consolation; but in
  truth, by his actions today your husband will bind Kaushalya to power and
  advantage.”
'26': >-
  “Having pushed aside Bharata—your son—among your own relatives, that
  wicked-minded king will tomorrow install Rama in a kingdom from which
  obstacles have been removed.”
'27': >-
  “Like a hidden enemy, under the pretext of a husband, he is cherished by you
  as though he were a mother seeking your good—like a venomous serpent carried
  close upon the body, O naïve one.”
'28': >-
  “For just as an enemy, or a serpent that has been neglected and left
  unchecked, would act—so has King Dasharatha acted toward you today, together
  with your son.”
'29': >-
  “O simple woman, ever accustomed to comfort, by his sinful and false
  consolations you will be destroyed along with your following, when he
  establishes Rama in the kingdom.”
'30': >-
  “Therefore, O Kaikeyi, seeing that the time has come, quickly do what is good
  for you. Save your son, yourself, and me as well, O you whose fortunes are
  wondrous to behold.”
'31': >-
  Hearing Manthara’s words, that fair-faced Kaikeyi rose from her bed, filled
  with joy—like an autumnal moonbeam.
'32': >-
  Kaikeyi, exceedingly pleased and full of astonishment, gave to the hunchback a
  splendid divine ornament.
'33': >-
  Having given that ornament to the hunchback, Kaikeyi—the best of
  women—joyfully spoke again to Manthara these words:
'34': >-
  “This, O Manthara, is supremely delightful news you have told me. Since you
  have told me what is dear to me, what more shall I do for you?”
'35': >-
  “Between Rama and Bharata I perceive no distinction. Therefore I am satisfied
  that the king will consecrate Rama to the kingdom.”
'36': >-
  “There is nothing beyond this here that is a better or more welcome thing for
  me, O you worthy of what is dear—sweet is your speech, a word like nectar.
  Since you have spoken this to me, I shall grant you a boon higher and greater
  than what is dear: choose that boon.”
'37': >-
  Thus ends the seventh sarga, called “Manthara’s Lamentation,” in the
  Ayodhya-kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the primeval epic.
