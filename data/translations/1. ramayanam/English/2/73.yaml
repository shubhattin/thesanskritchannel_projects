  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  seventy-third canto, called “The Condemnation of Kaikeyī.”
'1': >-
  But Bharata, having heard what had befallen his father and that both his
  brothers had been sent into exile, his heart scorched with grief, spoke these
  words:
'2': >-
  Of what use to me here is this kingdom, when I am stricken as one whose very
  self is slain, lamenting—bereft both of my father and of my brothers who were
  as a father to me?
'3': >-
  In my sorrow you have created yet more sorrow—like applying alkali to a
  wound—having brought the king to the state of one departed and made Rāma an
  ascetic.
'4': >-
  You have come for the ruin of this lineage like the night of doom; embracing a
  live coal, my father did not recognize it.
'5': >-
  The king has been brought to death by you, O sinful-minded woman; through
  delusion, happiness has been cast away in this family, O polluter of the
  dynasty.
'6': >-
  Indeed, on obtaining you, my father—true to his vows and of great renown—was
  consumed by sharp grief; such was the course of King Daśaratha.
'7': >-
  My father, the great king, devoted to dharma, has been destroyed. Why was Rāma
  banished? Why indeed was he sent to the forest?
'8': >-
  And Kauśalyā and Sumitrā, oppressed by grief for their sons—how could they
  even live, having you as my mother?
'9': >-
  And yet the noble one, righteous-souled and knowing the proper conduct toward
  elders, maintained toward you the highest manner of behaviour, as one behaves
  toward one’s mother.
'10': >-
  Even so, my eldest mother, Kauśalyā, far-seeing, taking her stand upon dharma,
  behaves toward you as toward a sister.
'11': >-
  Having sent her son—self-controlled, clothed in bark and deerskin—to dwell in
  the forest, how, O sinful woman, do you not grieve?
'12': >-
  Rāma, who beholds no sin, who is heroic, self-governed, and illustrious—having
  exiled him, clad in bark-garments, what cause do you now claim to see?
'13': >-
  I deem that, being greedy, you do not care for a Rāghava at all; for through
  you this great calamity has been brought about for the sake of kingdom and
  power.
'14': >-
  For I, not seeing those tiger-like men, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—by the might of what
  strength can I dare to protect the realm?
'15': >-
  For Rāma, ever the mighty one—though himself of great strength—relied upon
  that righteous-souled great king, as Mount Meru is supported by the
  Meru-forest.
'16': >-
  How shall I bear this burden, heavy and fit for great draught-beasts, when it
  has been taken up—like a broken ox approaching the yoke—by what force of
  energy can I endure it?
'17': >-
  Or if strength should arise in me—by discipline, or by the power of
  intellect—then I shall not fulfil your desire, O you who are greedy for a son.
'18': >-
  I would have no wish at all to abandon you, O woman resolved on sin, if in you
  there were regard for Rāma, as there is always in a mother.
'19': >-
  But how did this notion arise in you, O sinful-minded woman—fallen from good
  conduct—one censured by our forefathers?
'20': >-
  For in this dynasty the eldest of all is consecrated to the kingdom, and the
  other brothers then proceed in due order, composed and in harmony.
'21': >-
  I do not think, O cruel one, that you heed the dharma of kings; nor do you
  know the everlasting course of royal conduct.
'22': >-
  For always, according to royal practice, the eldest is consecrated to
  sovereignty; and this is the accepted custom of kings—especially among the
  Ikṣvākus.
'23': >-
  In that line—guarded by dharma alone and devoted to ancestral conduct—the
  pride in righteous character has been turned back on obtaining you.
'24': >-
  Even in your own lineage there were exceedingly fortunate lords of men,
  leaders of the family in former times; how then has this blameworthy delusion
  arisen in your mind?
'25': >-
  I shall not do as you wish, O woman resolved on sin; by you a calamity has
  been set in motion that is life-ending for me.
'26': >-
  Now, this very day, I shall reverse that blameless one’s distressing purpose
  of yours; I shall bring back from the forest my brother, beloved of his own
  people.
'27': >-
  And having brought Rāma back, I—radiant in energy—shall become his servant,
  with an inward heart firmly at peace.
'28': >-
  Thus having spoken, great-souled Bharata—piercing her with many words, some
  pleasing and some otherwise—though tormented with grief, roared again and
  again like a lion dwelling in a mountain cave.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-third canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic, entitled “The Condemnation of Kaikeyī.”
