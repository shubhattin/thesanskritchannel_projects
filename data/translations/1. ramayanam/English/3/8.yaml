  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  eighth sarga, called “Sutīkṣṇa’s Permission.”
'1': >-
  Rāma, together with Saumitrī (Lakṣmaṇa), having been duly honoured by
  Sutīkṣṇa, passed the night there; and when morning came, he awoke.
'2': >-
  And rising at the proper time, the scion of Raghū, along with Sītā, performed
  his morning ablutions, touching pure water that was cool and fragrant like
  blue lotuses.
'3': >-
  Then Vaidehī (Sītā), Rāma, and Lakṣmaṇa, in that forest which was a refuge of
  ascetics, worshipped in due rite the sacred fire and the gods in the early
  morning.
'4': >-
  Seeing the sun rising, and being free from impurity, they approached Sutīkṣṇa
  and spoke these gentle words:
'5': >-
  “O venerable sir, we have dwelt happily here, being honoured by you who are
  worthy of honour. We now take leave to depart; the sages are urging us
  onward.”
'6': >-
  “We are eager to behold the entire circle of hermitages of the ṛṣis—of holy
  conduct—who dwell in the Daṇḍaka forest.”
'7': >-
  “We wish to take your permission, together with these foremost of sages—ever
  steadfast in dharma, subdued by austerity—who are like fires without smoke.”
'8': >-
  “So long as the sun does not blaze with intolerable heat—like one who, devoid
  of lineage, obtains fortune that has come by an improper path—we desire to set
  out by then.”
'9': >-
  Having spoken thus, Rāghava, with Saumitrī and with Sītā, bowed at the sage’s
  feet.
'10': >-
  The foremost of sages raised them up as they touched his feet, embraced them
  firmly with affection, and spoke these words:
'11': >-
  “Go forth, Rāma, with Saumitrī, and with this Sītā beside you, following you
  like your very shadow; travel an auspicious, untroubled path.”
'12': >-
  “Behold, O hero, the delightful sites of the hermitages of those ascetics who
  dwell in the Daṇḍaka forest—men whose selves have been refined by austerity.”
'13': >-
  “You will see forests rich with excellent roots and fruits, woods in bloom,
  herds of worthy deer, and companies of birds that are calm and unalarmed.”
'14': >-
  “You will see ponds and lakes strewn with kāraṇḍava ducks, having clear
  waters, and tracts of fully blossomed lotuses.”
'15': >-
  “You will behold mountain-streams delightful to the sight, charming
  wildernesses, and places resounding with the cries of peacocks.”
'16': >-
  “Go then, dear child; and let Saumitrī also proceed. After you have seen them,
  you should return once more to this hermitage.”
'17': >-
  Thus addressed, the Kakutstha prince, along with Lakṣmaṇa, replied, “So be
  it,” and, having circumambulated the sage, began to set out.
'18': >-
  Then Sītā of large eyes gave to the two brothers their most auspicious quivers
  and bows; and then she also gave them two spotless swords.
'19': >-
  Binding on the fine quivers and taking up the bows that gave forth a sound,
  those two—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—departed from the hermitage to go forth.
'20': >-
  Soon, those two handsome princes, having received the great ṛṣi’s leave, set
  out with bows in hand—Rāghava together with Sītā.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the eighth sarga, named “Sutīkṣṇa’s Permission,” in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa
  of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
