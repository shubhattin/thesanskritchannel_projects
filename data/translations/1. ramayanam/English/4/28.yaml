  Now begins the twenty-eighth canto, entitled “The Uprising of the Rains
  (Prāvṛḍ-ujjṛmbhaṇam),” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Having then slain Vālī and having installed Sugrīva upon the throne, Rāma,
  dwelling upon the slope of Mount Mālyavat, spoke to Lakṣmaṇa.
'2': >-
  “This season has now arrived—the appointed time of the coming of waters.
  Behold, the sky is covered today with clouds that resemble mountains.”
'3': >-
  “After holding for nine months, having drunk in the sun’s rays and having
  imbibed the essence of the oceans, the heaven now brings forth the life-giving
  elixir in the form of rain.”
'4': >-
  “The Sun, ascending the firmament by stair-like rows of clouds, is as though
  able to adorn it with garlands of kuṭaja and arjuna blossoms.”
'5': >-
  “With cloud-fragments—coppery with the blush born of twilight, and within them
  also pale—smooth and glossy—the sky appears like a wound that has been bound
  up with bandages.”
'6': >-
  “Breathing with a gentle breeze and tinged with the sandal-hue of evening, the
  sky, with its pale clouds, shines like one afflicted by desire.”
'7': >-
  “The earth, tormented by the heat and now flooded with fresh waters, sheds
  tears, like Sītā consumed by the fever of sorrow.”
'8': >-
  “Released from the belly of the clouds, cool as flakes of camphor, and scented
  with ketaka, the winds can be drunk, as it were, with cupped palms.”
'9': >-
  “This mountain, with its arjuna trees in bloom and perfumed by ketaka, is
  bathed by streams of rain—like Sugrīva, his enemies pacified, being
  consecrated by ablutions.”
'10': >-
  “Wearing dark cloud-like hides, girt with rain as with sacred threads, and
  having their caves filled by the wind, the mountains appear like students who
  have duly studied their lesson.”
'11': >-
  “Lashed on every side by lightning like golden whips, with thunder resounding
  within, the sky seems as though it were suffering pain.”
'12': >-
  “Lightning, resting upon blue-black clouds, flashing again and again, appears
  to me like the ascetic Vaidehī flashing in Rāvaṇa’s lap.”
'13': >-
  “These directions—dear to those who are under Kāma’s sway—are checked and
  obscured by dense clouds, as though smeared over, with the planets and the
  moon no longer visible.”
'14': >-
  “Somewhere, O Saumitri, look at the kuṭaja trees upon the mountain
  slopes—blossoming, their view dimmed as though by tears, eager at the advent
  of the rains—standing there as exciters of desire for me who am overcome by
  grief.”
'15': >-
  “The dust has been stilled; the wind today is cool; the wide-spread faults of
  the hot season have subsided. The journeys of kings have come to a halt, and
  men who dwell away from home go to their own country.”
'16': >-
  “Now the cakravāka birds, intent on the waters of the lakes and accompanied by
  their beloveds, have set forth; yet on roads cut up by incessant rain-water,
  vehicles do not proceed.”
'17': >-
  “The sky appears—here bright, here not bright—strewn with clouds; and in
  places, blocked by mountains, like the form of the great ocean when it is
  calm.”
'18': >-
  “Fresh waters, mingled with the blossoms of śirīṣa and kadamba, new and
  copper-tinged with mountain minerals, accompanied by the cries of peacocks,
  are borne swiftly by the mountain streams.”
'19': >-
  “The jambu fruit, full of juice and dark like a swarm of bees, is plentifully
  enjoyed; and the ripe mango fruit, of many hues, shaken down by the wind,
  falls upon the ground.”
'20': >-
  “Clouds with banners of lightning and garlands of cranes, resembling the peaks
  of lordly mountains, roar with upsurging sound like intoxicated king-elephants
  stationed for battle.”
'21': >-
  “Behold how the forests, with grass nourished by rain-water and peacocks busy
  with the festival of dance, shine even more in the afternoons when the clouds
  have poured down their rain.”
'22': >-
  “Bearing the heavy burden of water, the cloud-masses, filled with cranes and
  rumbling, rest again and again upon the great summits of mountains and then
  depart once more.”
'23': >-
  “The line of cranes, delighted, hastening toward the beloved clouds, appears
  like a long, lovely garland of fine white lotuses, blown by the wind, upon the
  beautiful sky.”
'24': >-
  “The earth shines with fresh green grass variegated with young indragopa
  insects, like a woman with limbs anointed with lac-dye, wearing a blanket
  bright as a parrot’s sheen.”
'25': >-
  “Sleep slowly approaches Keśava; swiftly the river approaches the sea; the
  joyful crane approaches the cloud; the beloved woman, filled with desire,
  approaches her dear one.”
'26': >-
  “The forest tracts have come alive with peacocks dancing well; kadamba trees
  have come forth with their kadamba-laden branches; the bulls among the cows
  are stirred with equal desire; the earth has become delightful with crops and
  forests.”
'27': >-
  “They bear along, they pour, they rumble, they gleam; they brood, they dance,
  they take comfort—rivers, clouds, intoxicated elephants, forest tracts,
  peacocks bereft of their mates, and monkeys.”
'28': >-
  “Great elephants, exhilarated by inhaling the fragrance of ketakī flowers and
  maddened in the forest cascades, with their ears filled with the clamour of
  waterfall-sounds, trumpet in delight along with the peacocks, sharing the same
  intoxication.”
'29': >-
  “Struck by the falling sheets of rain and hanging down from kadamba branches,
  bees gradually abandon their intoxication—won in a moment—after plunging deep
  into the nectar-juice of flowers.”
'30': >-
  “The branches of jambu trees shine with fruits like heaps of powdered embers,
  rich and abundantly filled with juice, as though being drunk up by swarms of
  bees.”
'31': >-
  “Adorned with banners of lightning and uttering deep and mighty roars, the
  forms of the rain-clouds appear like war-elephants eager for combat.”
'32': >-
  “An elephant-lord, following the path and ranging along mountains and forests,
  having set forth on hearing the roar of clouds, eager for battle and
  suspecting a challenge in the answering thunder, has turned back to face it.”
'33': >-
  “Forest margins, sheltering many creatures, appear—here as though sung by
  swarms of bees, here as though danced by peacocks, and here as though made
  frenzied by lordly elephants.”
'34': >-
  “The woodland ground, rich with tender shoots of kadamba, śirīṣa, and arjuna
  and filled with honeyed moisture, shines like a drinking-ground, with peacocks
  intoxicated and dancing about.”
'35': >-
  “Water, pearl-like and very clear, falling and clinging in leaf-cups—thirsty
  birds, delighted though their plumage has lost its colour, drink it as though
  it were bestowed by Indra.”
'36': >-
  “With bees as its lute-strings and sweet notes as its very name, with the
  monkeys providing rhythm by their throats, and made manifest by the sound of
  cloud-drums, it is as though music has begun in the forests.”
'37': >-
  “With peacocks—here dancing, here calling loudly, and here sitting upon the
  tops of trees, wearing pendent tail-feathers as ornaments—it is as though
  music has begun in the forests.”
'38': >-
  “Awakened by the sound of the clouds, the monkeys, abandoning the
  long-restrained sleep, cry out—struck by fresh showers—of many forms, shapes,
  colours, and calls.”
'39': >-
  “The rivers, carrying along the cakravāka birds, washing away their crumbling
  banks, and swollen with the full current of the new rainy season, proudly go
  to meet their own lord—the ocean.”
'40': >-
  “Among the blue the blue stands out—new waters full among dark things; among
  clouds, clouds appear closely massed; among hills burned by forest-fire, hills
  likewise burned seem rooted together upon the mountains.”
'41': >-
  “Elephants roam the exceedingly lovely forest regions—filled with peacocks
  calling in frenzy and with grassy tracts crowded with indragopa
  insects—haunted by blossoming nīpa and arjuna trees.”
'42': >-
  “Struck by new showers, quickly leaving the lotuses whose filaments are beaten
  down, the delighted bees drink the fresh kadamba blossoms along with their
  filaments.”
'43': >-
  “Elephants are in rut, bulls are gladdened, lions in the forests are more
  valiant, mountains are charming, kings are hidden away, and Indra sports with
  the rain-clouds.”
'44': >-
  “The clouds, whose rumblings arise from the ocean, hanging in the sky with
  mighty torrents, sweep away rivers, ponds, lakes, wells, and the entire earth
  itself.”
'45': >-
  “Violent rains fall in abundance; winds blow with upsurging force; rivers,
  their banks destroyed, swiftly carry their waters, their channels thrown into
  confusion.”
'46': >-
  “Like kings honoured by men, the lordly mountains—sprinkled by
  cloud-water-jars brought by the wind and bestowed by Indra—display, as it
  were, the splendour of their own sovereign majesty.”
'47': >-
  “The sky, enveloped by dense clouds, shows neither stars nor does the sun come
  into view; the earth is satisfied by fresh floods of water; the directions,
  smeared with darkness, are without light.”
'48': >-
  “The great peaks of mountains, washed by the descending streams, shine all the
  more—by reason of huge, broad waterfalls hanging down like clusters of
  pearls.”
'49': >-
  “The vast waterfalls of lofty mountains, their force slipping over rock-slabs,
  in caves resounding with peacocks, appear like necklaces being scattered
  abroad.”
'50': >-
  “Swift-flowing and vast, the waterfalls—washing the rocky surfaces of mountain
  peaks, like cascades of pearls as they fall—are held upon the ledges and
  floors of great mountain-caves.”
'51': >-
  “Everywhere around, in the quarters, the streams of water fall—restless—like
  pearl-strings from the necklaces of celestial women broken off in the ardour
  of love-play.”
'52': >-
  “From birds melting away into silence, from lotuses closing, and from the
  mālatī jasmine blossoming, the setting of the sun is known.”
'53': >-
  “The expedition of kings has ceased; the army stays as though it were on a
  safe road. Rivalries as well as roads are made even and level by the water.”
'54': >-
  “In the month of Prauṣṭhapada, O Brahman, for brahmins who desire to recite,
  this is the time for study; the season for Sāma-chanters has arrived.”
'55': >-
  “Surely Bharata, lord of Kośala, having withdrawn to a place free of official
  duties and having gathered his stores, has now entered upon the Āṣāḍhī
  observance.”
'56': >-
  “Surely, as the Sarayū fills up, its speed increases—like the sound of Ayodhyā
  itself coming to meet me as I draw near.”
'57': >-
  “These rains, rich in abundance, Sugrīva enjoys in happiness—his enemies
  subdued, united with his consort, and established in his vast kingdom.”
'58': >-
  “But I—deprived of my wife and fallen from a great kingdom—sink down, O
  Lakṣmaṇa, like a riverbank made sodden and collapsing.”
'59': >-
  “My sorrow is wide-spread, and the rains are exceedingly hard to pass through;
  and Rāvaṇa, that great enemy, seems to me boundless and insurmountable.”
'60': >-
  “Seeing this impossibility of travel and the roads made exceedingly difficult,
  and seeing Sugrīva bowed down (in submission), I said nothing at all.”
'61': >-
  “Moreover, since the monkey has, after a long time, attained the hardship-worn
  reunion with his wife, I do not wish to speak—because my own purpose weighs
  more heavily upon me.”
'62': >-
  “Sugrīva himself, surely, after resting and recognizing that the proper time
  has arrived, will understand the service done to him—of this there is no
  doubt.”
'63': >-
  “Therefore I remain, awaiting the time, O you of auspicious marks, longing for
  the favour (good disposition) of Sugrīva and for the rivers to become calm.”
'64': >-
  “For a hero is joined to requital by means of a good deed; an ungrateful man,
  who does not return what was done, strikes at the heart of the noble.”
'65': >-
  “Thus addressed, Lakṣmaṇa, having composed himself, with palms joined, duly
  honoured those words; and then he spoke to Rāma of pleasing countenance,
  showing (by his expression) the auspicious intention of his own heart.”
'66': >-
  “All that has been spoken by you, O lord of men, is desirable; and the lord of
  monkeys will accomplish it before long. Let your honour bear with this waiting
  for the autumn; in the subduing of the foe, this downpour of waters is a
  restraint.”
'67': >-
  “Thus ends the twenty-eighth canto, called “The Uprising of the Rains,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.”}]}
