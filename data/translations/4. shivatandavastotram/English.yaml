'0': Now begins the Śiva Tāṇḍava Stotram, composed by Rāvaṇa.
'1': >-
  May Śiva ever bestow auspiciousness upon us—He who performed the fierce
  Tāṇḍava dance; in whose matted locks the streaming waters (of Gaṅgā) flow,
  sanctifying the very ground; upon whose neck there hangs, suspended, the lofty
  garland of serpents; and whose ḍamaru resounds again and again with the
  reverberating “ḍamaḍ-ḍamaḍ-ḍamaḍ” thunder.
'2': >-
  At every moment may my delight rest in Him—upon whose head the celestial
  river, stirred within the basin of His matted hair, whirls and sways as its
  playful waves spread forth in a brilliant cascade; upon whose forehead the
  fire blazes with the crackling “dhagad-dhagad” radiance; and who bears the
  young crescent-moon as His crown.
'3': >-
  May my mind find pleasure in that Reality—Śiva, the Digambara (the sky-clad
  Lord), whose heart rejoices with the ever-expanding exultation of the
  horizons, made radiant by the charming companionship of the Daughter of the
  Mountain (Pārvatī); and by the continuous stream of His compassionate,
  sidelong glances even the most unbearable calamity is checked and held at bay.
'4': >-
  May the Wielder and Sustainer of all beings (Bhūta-bhartṛ) uphold in me
  wondrous joy—He whose serpent-adorned locks glow with the tawny brilliance of
  the jewels upon the hoods of the serpents; whose directions are, as it were,
  anointed with flowing vermilion from that splendor, as though painting the
  faces of the quarters’ brides; and whose mighty upper garment is the hide of
  an elephant, swelling and shining as it quivers, like a rut-maddened lord of
  elephants.
'5': >-
  May the Lord, who wears the moon—the friend of the cakora birds—be for our
  prosperity, and may that prosperity endure long: He whose footstool is greyed
  by the thick, continuous dust of flowers fallen from the crowns of the
  thousand-eyed Indra and all the other gods; He whose piled matted hair is
  firmly bound and garlanded with the king of serpents.
'6': >-
  May our well-being be of the nature of the Great Skull-bearer’s majesty—of
  Śiva whose tangled hair is crowned by the line of the moon’s nectar-bearing
  rays; before whom the leader of the gods bows after the five arrows of Kāma
  are, as it were, drunk up; and from whose brow’s broad expanse the blazing
  fire sends forth sparks like the flame of Dhanañjaya (Arjuna) in its burning
  intensity.
'7': >-
  At every moment may my love be in the Three-eyed Lord—He upon whose terrible
  forehead the blazing fire crackles “dhagad-dhagad,” and in that fierce
  oblation the five arrows of Kāma are utterly consumed; He who is the sole
  supreme artisan, fashioning wondrous designs upon the bosom’s forefront of the
  Daughter of the Mountain (Pārvatī).
'8': >-
  May He, the Bearer of the celestial river (Gaṅgā), the Lord who wears the
  elephant-hide, grant us prosperity—He whose neck is bound with the dense
  darkness of the new-moon night, deep and hard to pierce, like a mass of
  freshly gathered storm-clouds; He who is charming as the treasury of all arts
  (the Moon); and He who bears and sustains the whole universe.
'9': >-
  I worship Him—who is the slayer of Smara (Kāma), the destroyer of the triple
  city, the cutter of worldly bondage, the destroyer of the sacrifice, the
  slayer of Gaja, the slayer of Andhaka, and the destroyer of Yama (Death);
  whose neck is adorned with a dangling, spreading splendor, dark as the
  abundant blackness of a fully blossomed blue lotus.
'10': >-
  I worship Him—Smara-antaka, Pura-antaka, Bhava-antaka, Makha-antaka,
  Gaja-antaka, Andhaka-antaka, and Antaka-antaka (the Destroyer of Death); Him
  whose auspicious glory is vast and unbroken, like a cluster of many blossoming
  buds; and whose honeyed sweetness flows forth in an ever-expanding stream,
  drawing in the bee-swarms of devotion.
'11': >-
  Victorious indeed is Śiva, whose fierce Tāṇḍava is set in motion by the
  powerful sequence of auspicious sounds—“dhimiddhimiddhimi”—from the exalted
  mṛdaṅga; while from the whirling motion of the serpent, tossed by the play of
  His roaming arms, the terrible fire on His dreadful forehead flares forth and
  streams outward with each breath and movement.
'12': >-
  When shall I worship Sadāśiva, who makes the mind move in perfect
  equality—towards a bed of bare rock and towards a richly ornamented couch;
  towards a garland of pearls and towards a mere lump of stone; towards friend
  and towards enemy; towards a blade of grass and towards a lotus; and likewise
  towards the common people and towards Indra, the lord of the earth (the king
  of gods)—seeing all with the same vision?
'13': >-
  When shall I be truly happy—dwelling within the hollow groves along the
  celestial river’s banks; ever free from perverse and misguided thoughts;
  continually bearing upon my head the folded hands of reverent offering; with
  restless, wandering eyes stilled; absorbed in the sign upon the noble
  forehead; and ceaselessly uttering the mantra, “Śiva, Śiva”?
'14': >-
  Truly, this sublime hymn—ever to be recited in this very manner—when a person
  reads it, remembers it, and speaks it aloud, he attains unbroken purity. He
  quickly reaches true devotion to Hari and to Guru, and he attains no other
  course (than this highest way). For the contemplation of the supremely
  beneficent Śaṅkara alone is the true enchantment and liberating fascination
  for embodied beings.
'15': >-
  May it grant our minds delight day and night—the captivating sweetness that
  drips forth abundantly from the garlanded cluster of jasmine (mālatī) crowning
  the city of the Lord of the gods; may it ever bestow playful joy; it is the
  supreme splendor, the highest state, and the amassed radiance of those who are
  born from His own limbs (His divine progeny and manifestations).
'16': >-
  May it be for the victory of the universe—this radiant proclamation, brilliant
  as the fierce submarine fire, that spreads auspiciously forth; this utterance
  invoked by multitudes of maidens (yoginīs) desiring the great eight siddhis;
  this sound that rose at the marriage, setting free the beautiful left eye (of
  the Goddess) in joyous expression; adorned with the ornament of the mantra,
  “Śiva”.
'17': >-
  I bow to the Lord of Pārvatī; I bow to the Lord of the Jāhnavī (Gaṅgā); I bow
  to Him who is tenderly affectionate to His devotees; I bow to the One with the
  eye upon His forehead. I bow to the Moon-crested Lord; I bow to the Remover of
  sorrow. I remember the lotus-feet of that Naṭeśvara (Lord of Dance).
'18': >-
  At the conclusion of worship, in the sacred time of pradoṣa, whoever recites
  this song sung by the ten-faced one (Rāvaṇa), being wholly devoted to the
  worship of Śambhu—unto him Śambhu bestows ever and again a steady and enduring
  Lakṣmī (prosperity): gracious and fair-faced, accompanied by chariots,
  elephants, and horses.
'19': Thus ends the Śiva Tāṇḍava Stotram, composed by Śrī Rāvaṇa, complete.
