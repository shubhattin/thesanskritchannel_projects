atha shrImadbhagavadgItA

And Now, We start the Holy Bhagavadgita

अथ षष्ठोऽध्यायः ।   आत्मसंयमयोगः
atha ShaShThoadhyAyaH    AtmasanyamaYogaaH

Thus starts the sixth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, called AtmasanyamaYogaH.

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
shrIbhagavAnuvAcha 

Lord Krishna, continuing his explanation of the nature of activity that leads to liberation, spoke thus: 

अनाश्रितः कर्मफलं कार्यं कर्म करोति यः ।
स संन्यासी च योगी च न निरग्निर्न चाक्रियः ॥ ६-१॥
anAshritaH karmaphalaM kAryan karma karoti yaH 
sa sannyAsI cha YogaI cha na niragnirna chAkriyaH  6.1

Someone who performs activity that needs to be done, without fixating on the results, is a true yogi and a sage.
Not someone who merely stopped performing all extrenal or internal activity.

यं संन्यासमिति प्राहुर्योगं तं विद्धि पाण्डव ।
न ह्यसंन्यस्तसङ्कल्पो योगी भवति कश्चन ॥ ६-२॥
yaM sannyAsamiti prAhurYogaaM taM viddhi pANDava 
na hyasannyastasankalpo YogaI bhavati kashchana  6.2

O son of pAnDu, know that what is talked about as renunciation is the same as yoga.
No one becomes a true yogI, without renouncing the desire for results to action.

आरुरुक्षोर्मुनेर्योगं कर्म कारणमुच्यते ।
योगारूढस्य तस्यैव शमः कारणमुच्यते ॥ ६-३॥
ArurukShormunerYogaaM karma kAraNamuchyate 
YogaArUDhasya tasyaiva shamaH kAraNamuchyate  6.3

Equanimous activity is the means to climb on the path towards yoga.
Once someone is established in yoga, renunciation is the means to liberation.

यदा हि नेन्द्रियार्थेषु न कर्मस्वनुषज्जते ।
सर्वसङ्कल्पसंन्यासी योगारूढस्तदोच्यते ॥ ६-४॥
yadA hi nendriyArtheShu na karmasvanuShajjate 
sarvasankalpasannyAsI YogaArUDhastadochyate  6.4

When one is neither attached to sense objects nor to actions, such a person who has renounced all desires for the fruits of actions, is said to be elevated in the path of Yoga.

उद्धरेदात्मनात्मानं नात्मानमवसादयेत् ।
आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुरात्मैव रिपुरात्मनः ॥ ६-५॥
uddharedAtmanAtmAnaM nAtmAnamavasAdayet 
Atmaiva hyAtmano bandhurAtmaiva ripurAtmanaH  6.5

One should elevate oneself and not degrade oneself.
You can be the best friend to your own self, or your own worst enemy.

बन्धुरात्मात्मनस्तस्य येनात्मैवात्मना जितः ।
अनात्मनस्तु शत्रुत्वे वर्तेतात्मैव शत्रुवत् ॥ ६-६॥
bandhurAtmAtmanastasya yenAtmaivAtmanA jitaH 
anAtmanastu shatrutve vartetAtmaiva shatruvat  6.6

The self is the best friend for such a person who is victorious over one's own compulsions.
For one who has no control over one's own compulsions of the self, it is one's own worst enemy.

जितात्मनः प्रशान्तस्य परमात्मा समाहितः ।
शीतोष्णसुखदुःखेषु तथा मानापमानयोः ॥ ६-७॥
jitAtmanaH prashAntasya paramAtmA samAhitaH 
shItoShNasukhaduHkheShu tathA mAnApamAnayoH  6.7

The divine is established in such a person who has won over one's own self.
Such a person is at peace within, amidst the dualities of hot and cold, pleasure and pain, or honour and shame.

ज्ञानविज्ञानतृप्तात्मा कूटस्थो विजितेन्द्रियः ।

jnAnavijnAnatRptAtmA kUTastho vijitendriyaH 
yukta ityuchyate YogaI samaloShTAshmakAnchanaH  6.8

Such a person who is content with true knowledge of the self, who is victorious over one's own senses, and perceives either gold and stone with the same perspective, is said to be a true yogi.

सुहृन्मित्रार्युदासीनमध्यस्थद्वेष्यबन्धुषु ।

suhRnmitrAryudAsInamadhyasthadveShyabandhuShu 
sAdhuShvapi cha pApeShu samabuddhirvishiShyate  6.9

Such a person who looks upon all—well-wishers, friends, strangers, foes, the pious, and the sinners—with an impartial mind, such a person is considered to be distinguished among humans.

योगी युञ्जीत सततमात्मानं रहसि स्थितः ।
एकाकी यतचित्तात्मा निराशीरपरिग्रहः ॥ ६-१०॥
YogaI yunjIta satatamAtmAnaM rahasi sthitaH 
ekAkI yatachittAtmA nirAshIraparigrahaH  6.10

Those who seek the state of Yoga should reside in seclusion, constantly engaged in meditation with a controlled mind and body, getting rid of desires and possessions for enjoyment.

शुचौ देशे प्रतिष्ठाप्य स्थिरमासनमात्मनः ।
नात्युच्छ्रितं नातिनीचं चैलाजिनकुशोत्तरम् ॥ ६-११॥
shuchau deshe pratiShThApya sthiramAsanamAtmanaH 
nAtyuchChritaM nAtinIchan chailAjinakushottaram  6.11

To practice Yoga, one should settle in an fixed asana in a sanctified place, 
that is not too high above or too down below,
and covered with either a clean cloth, deer skin, or kusha grass.

तत्रैकाग्रं मनः कृत्वा यतचित्तेन्द्रियक्रियः ।
उपविश्यासने युञ्ज्याद्योगमात्मविशुद्धये ॥ ६-१२॥
tatraikAgraM manaH kRtvA yatachittendriyakriyaH 
upavishyAsane yunjyAdYogaamAtmavishuddhaye  6.12

One should settle into an asana, and then with a focused mind, one should strive to purify the knowledge of the self, by control over the sway of the senses. 

समं कायशिरोग्रीवं धारयन्नचलं स्थिरः ।
सम्प्रेक्ष्य नासिकाग्रं स्वं दिशश्चानवलोकयन् ॥ ६-१३॥
samaM kAyashirogrIvaM dhArayannachalaM sthiraH 
samprekShya nAsikAgraM svaM dishashchAnavalokayan  6.13

By holding one's torso, neck and head in a straightline, one should sit unmoving, and hold a steady and undisturbed focus at the peak of one's nose.

प्रशान्तात्मा विगतभीर्ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थितः ।
मनः संयम्य मच्चित्तो युक्त आसीत मत्परः ॥ ६-१४॥
prashAntAtmA vigatabhIrbrahmachArivrate sthitaH 
manaH sanyamya machchitto yukta AsIta matparaH  6.14

Thus, with a serene, fearless, and unwavering mind,
in steady pursuit to realize brahman=the supreme consciousness,
one should be immersed onself in the nature of the self.

युञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी नियतमानसः ।
शान्तिं निर्वाणपरमां मत्संस्थामधिगच्छति ॥ ६-१५॥
yunjannevaM sadAtmAnaM YogaI niyatamAnasaH 
shAntin nirvANaparamAM matsansthAmadhigachChati  6.15

And thus, a yogi who is of a disciplined mind, should constaly try to united with the identity of the true self.
By doing so, one shall attain true inner peace of liberation, that eternally resides within 'Me".

नात्यश्नतस्तु योगोऽस्ति न चैकान्तमनश्नतः ।
न चातिस्वप्नशीलस्य जाग्रतो नैव चार्जुन ॥ ६-१६॥
nAtyashnatastu Yogaoasti na chaikAntamanashnataH 
na chAtisvapnashIlasya jAgrato naiva chArjuna  6.16

O Arjuna, the state of yoga is not possible for one who consumes too much. There is no focus for someone who doesn't consume at all. It is neither possible for a person who is overly involved in dreams, and nor for someone who exerts oneself in prolonged wakefulness.

युक्ताहारविहारस्य  युक्तचेष्टस्य कर्मसु ।
युक्तस्वप्नावबोधस्य योगो भवति दुःखहा ॥ ६-१७॥
yuktAhAravihArasya  yuktacheShTasya karmasu 
yuktasvapnAvabodhasya Yogao bhavati duHkhahA  6.17

For a person who consciously consumes, who consciously let's go, and performs all all activity including sleep and wakefulness consciously, the state of yoga is attained, removing all suffering.

यदा विनियतं चित्तमात्मन्येवावतिष्ठते ।
निःस्पृहः सर्वकामेभ्यो युक्त इत्युच्यते तदा ॥ ६-१८॥
yadA viniyatan chittamAtmanyevAvatiShThate 
niHspRhaH sarvakAmebhyo yukta ityuchyate tadA  6.18

When one's disciplined mind is always established in the knowledge of the true self,
such a person who is not swayed by any kind of desires is then called a yogi.

यथा दीपो निवातस्थो नेङ्गते सोपमा स्मृता ।
योगिनो यतचित्तस्य युञ्जतो योगमात्मनः ॥ ६-१९॥
yathA dIpo nivAtastho nengate sopamA smRtA 
Yogaino yatachittasya yunjato YogaamAtmanaH  6.19

Just as a lamp is steady in the absence of breeze, so is the disciplined mind of a yogi, who remains steady in meditation of the self.

यत्रोपरमते चित्तं निरुद्धं योगसेवया ।
यत्र चैवात्मनात्मानं पश्यन्नात्मनि तुष्यति ॥ ६-२०॥
yatroparamate chittaM niruddhaM YogaasevayA 
yatra chaivAtmanAtmAnaM pashyannAtmani tuShyati  6.20

Where the mind dwells in joy, by absolute control brought about through yoga,
there one witnesses the nature of one's true self, and stays in bliss.

सुखमात्यन्तिकं यत्तद् बुद्धिग्राह्यमतीन्द्रियम् ।
वेत्ति यत्र न चैवायं स्थितश्चलति तत्त्वतः ॥ ६-२१॥
sukhamAtyantikaM yattad buddhigrAhyamatIndriyam 
vetti yatra na chaivAyaM sthitashchalati tattvataH  6.21

The one who understands the possibility, of that highest state of joyfulness which is beyong the realm of the senses, such a person then starts to walk thatpath of self-realization steadily.

यं लब्ध्वा चापरं लाभं मन्यते नाधिकं ततः ।
यस्मिन्स्थितो न दुःखेन गुरुणापि विचाल्यते ॥ ६-२२॥
yaM labdhvA chAparaM lAbhaM manyate nAdhikaM tataH 
yasminsthito na duHkhena guruNApi vichAlyate  6.22

By attaining that highest gain, after which there is nothing superior left to attain;
and in which state one doesn't get swayed even by the strongest of unpleasant situations,

तं विद्याद् दुःखसंयोगवियोगं योगसंज्ञितम् ।
स निश्चयेन योक्तव्यो योगोऽनिर्विण्णचेतसा ॥ ६-२३॥
taM vidyAd duHkhasanYogaaviYogaaM Yogaasanjnitam 
sa nishchayena yoktavyo YogaoanirviNNachetasA  6.23

know that to be the state of being called yoga, where there is no more suffering.
A seeker should strive for such a state with certainty, without doubt and despair in the mind.

सङ्कल्पप्रभवान्कामांस्त्यक्त्वा सर्वानशेषतः ।
मनसैवेन्द्रियग्रामं विनियम्य समन्ततः ॥ ६-२४॥
sankalpaprabhavAnkAmAnstyaktvA sarvAnasheShataH 
manasaivendriyagrAmaM viniyamya samantataH  6.24

One should do so, by letting go of fixating upon the desire for results for all action,
by gaining total control over one's mind and all sense organs.

शनैः शनैरुपरमेद् बुद्ध्या धृतिगृहीतया ।
आत्मसंस्थं मनः कृत्वा न किञ्चिदपि चिन्तयेत् ॥ ६-२५॥
shanaiH shanairuparamed budhdhyA dhRtigRhItayA 
AtmasansthaM manaH kRtvA na kinchidapi chintayet  6.25

One shall progress on this path Slowly and steadily, with a mind that is steady and focused.
The mind should be unwavering and focused on the true knowledge of the self.

यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् ।
ततस्ततो नियम्यैतदात्मन्येव वशं नयेत् ॥ ६-२६॥
yato yato nishcharati manashchanchalamasthiram 
tatastato niyamyaitadAtmanyeva vashaM nayet  6.26

Whenever and wherever the restless and unsteady mind wanders, one should bring it back and continually focus it within one's own self.

प्रशान्तमनसं ह्येनं योगिनं सुखमुत्तमम् ।
उपैति शान्तरजसं ब्रह्मभूतमकल्मषम् ॥ ६-२७॥
prashAntamanasaM hyenaM YogainaM sukhamuttamam 
upaiti shAntarajasaM brahmabhUtamakalmaSham  6.27

Ultimate bliss is attained by such a yogi, who is of a calm mind, who has pacified his need for action and who is rid of his false sense of self.

युञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी विगतकल्मषः ।
सुखेन ब्रह्मसंस्पर्शमत्यन्तं सुखमश्नुते ॥ ६-२८॥
yunjannevaM sadAtmAnaM YogaI vigatakalmaShaH 
sukhena brahmasansparshamatyantaM sukhamashnute  6.28

Such a yogi, who is rid of his false identity, who is always immersed in the true knowledge of the self, enjoys utmost bliss, which in other words is true contact with divinity.

सर्वभूतस्थमात्मानं सर्वभूतानि चात्मनि ।
ईक्षते योगयुक्तात्मा सर्वत्र समदर्शनः ॥ ६-२९॥
sarvabhUtasthamAtmAnaM sarvabhUtAni chAtmani 
IkShate YogaayuktAtmA sarvatra samadarshanaH  6.29

Such a being who is established in the state of yoga, is of an equanimous perception,and sees one's own self in all living beings, and all living beings within one's own self. 

यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति ।
तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति ॥ ६-३०॥
yo mAM pashyati sarvatra sarvan cha mayi pashyati 
tasyAhaM na praNashyAmi sa cha me na praNashyati  6.30

Such a person who sees "Me" in everything and sees everything within "Myself", "I" am not not lost for such a person, and such a person is not lost to "Me"

सर्वभूतस्थितं यो मां भजत्येकत्वमास्थितः ।
सर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि स योगी मयि वर्तते ॥ ६-३१॥
sarvabhUtasthitaM yo mAM bhajatyekatvamAsthitaH 
sarvathA vartamAnoapi sa YogaI mayi vartate  6.31

When such a person who is established in this unity with eveyrthing, meditates upon "Me",
one constatly resides in my own self despite being engaged in all kinds of activities.

आत्मौपम्येन सर्वत्र समं पश्यति योऽर्जुन ।
सुखं वा यदि वा दुःखं स योगी परमो मतः ॥ ६-३२॥
Atmaupamyena sarvatra samaM pashyati yoarjuna 
sukhaM vA yadi vA duHkhaM sa YogaI paramo mataH  6.32

Such a Yogi who is empowered by the knowledge of the true self, who looks upon pleasantness or unpleasantness with the same perspective is said to be of the highest order.

अर्जुन उवाच ।
arjuna uvAcha

Arjuna who was unable to grasp this teaching of Lord Krishna, expressed his doubts thus:

योऽयं योगस्त्वया प्रोक्तः साम्येन मधुसूदन ।
एतस्याहं न पश्यामि चञ्चलत्वात्स्थितिं स्थिराम् ॥ ६-३३॥
yoayaM YogaastvayA proktaH sAmyena madhusUdana 
etasyAhaM na pashyAmi chanchalatvAtsthitin sthirAm  6.33

O Madhusudana, I don't see how this state of yoga that you have described can be achieved.
I don't see how I can practice this method of eqanimity because my mind is wavering constantly.

चञ्चलं हि मनः कृष्ण प्रमाथि बलवद् दृढम् ।
तस्याहं निग्रहं मन्ये वायोरिव सुदुष्करम् ॥ ६-३४॥
chanchalaM hi manaH kRShNa pramAthi balavad dRDham 
tasyAhaM nigrahaM manye vAyoriva suduShkaram  6.34

The mind is very restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate, O Krishna. 
It feels to me that it is more difficult to control the mind than to control the wind.

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
shrIbhagavAnuvAcha 

Lord Krishna then replied thus

असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम् ।
अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते ॥ ६-३५॥
asanshayaM mahAbAho mano durnigrahan chalam 
abhyAsena tu kaunteya vairAgyeNa cha gRhyate  6.35

O mighty-armed son of Kunti, undoubtedly it is very difficult to control the mind; 
It can only be brought about by repeated practice and through dis-identification with passions.

असंयतात्मना योगो दुष्प्राप इति मे मतिः ।
वश्यात्मना तु यतता शक्योऽवाप्तुमुपायतः ॥ ६-३६॥
asanyatAtmanA Yogao duShprApa iti me matiH 
vashyAtmanA tu yatatA shakyoavAptumupAyataH  6.36

I think that it is impossible for someone who does not work towards equanimity to attain yoga.
However, someone who has attained mastery over one's own self, it is very much a possibility, that can attained through the right practices. 

अर्जुन उवाच ।
arjuna uvAcha 

Arjuna then had a question which he expressed thus:

अयतिः श्रद्धयोपेतो योगाच्चलितमानसः ।
अप्राप्य योगसंसिद्धिं कां गतिं कृष्ण गच्छति ॥ ६-३७॥
ayatiH shraddhayopeto YogaAchchalitamAnasaH 
aprApya Yogaasansiddhin kAn gatin kRShNa gachChati  6.37

O Krishna, if someone starts on the path of yoga, but then gives up the practice and gets off track;
What will happen to such a person who doesn't attain the final objective!

कच्चिन्नोभयविभ्रष्टश्छिन्नाभ्रमिव नश्यति ।

kachchinnobhayavibhraShTashChinnAbhramiva nashyati

Will such a person be deprived of both material security and spiritual success?
Will someone who started on the path of yoga but left it midway dissipate, like a cloud which neither has it's form nor falls as rain!

एतन्मे संशयं कृष्ण छेत्तुमर्हस्यशेषतः ।

O Krishna, please dispel this doubt of mine completely!
I do not see who else can answer this question apart from you!

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
shrIbhagavAnuvAcha 

Then Lord Krishna replied:

पार्थ नैवेह नामुत्र विनाशस्तस्य विद्यते ।
न हि कल्याणकृत्कश्चिद् दुर्गतिं तात गच्छति ॥ ६-४०॥
pArtha naiveha nAmutra vinAshastasya vidyate 
na hi kalyANakRtkashchid durgatin tAta gachChati  6.40

O Partha, there is no harm for such a person in the material or the spiritual realm.
The one who performs auspicious action doesn't attain to inauspicious outcome.

प्राप्य पुण्यकृतां लोकानुषित्वा शाश्वतीः समाः ।
शुचीनां श्रीमतां गेहे योगभ्रष्टोऽभिजायते ॥ ६-४१॥
prApya puNyakRtAn lokAnuShitvA shAshvatIH samAH

Someone who strayed from the pursuit of yoga midway, will enjoy the benefits of one's auspicious deeds. 
One shall enjoy the pleasant, but impermanent outcome of one's actions, 
and then be born again in a home of auspicious and prosperous people.

अथवा योगिनामेव कुले भवति धीमताम् ।
एतद्धि दुर्लभतरं लोके जन्म यदीदृशम् ॥ ६-४२॥
athavA YogainAmeva kule bhavati dhImatAm 
etaddhi durlabhataraM loke janma yadIdRsham  6.42

Otherwise, they shall be born into a house of attained yogis.
This kind of a birth is very difficult to attain in this world.

तत्र तं बुद्धिसंयोगं लभते पौर्वदेहिकम् ।
यतते च ततो भूयः संसिद्धौ कुरुनन्दन ॥ ६-४३॥
tatra taM buddhisanYogaaM labhate paurvadehikam 
yatate cha tato bhUyaH sansiddhau kurunandana  6.43

And there, O descendant of Kurus, such people regain the knowledge belonging to the bodies of previous lifetimes.
They then continue their seeking with renewed effort. 

पूर्वाभ्यासेन तेनैव ह्रियते ह्यवशोऽपि सः ।
जिज्ञासुरपि योगस्य शब्दब्रह्मातिवर्तते ॥ ६-४४॥
pUrvAbhyAsena tenaiva hriyate hyavashoapi saH 
jijnAsurapi Yogaasya shabdabrahmAtivartate  6.44

Due to the practice they put in during previous lifetimes, they get drawn towards this path as if beyond their control. A seeker of this path of yoga, goes beyond the materialistic manifestations of creation. 

प्रयत्नाद्यतमानस्तु योगी संशुद्धकिल्बिषः ।
अनेकजन्मसंसिद्धस्ततो याति परां गतिम् ॥ ६-४५॥
prayatnAdyatamAnastu YogaI sanshuddhakilbiShaH 
anekajanmasansiddhastato yAti parAM gatim  6.45

Such a yogi who continuously gets rid of his false identities though multiple lifetimes of continued preparation and effort, attains to the ultimate state of pure consciousness.

तपस्विभ्योऽधिको योगी ज्ञानिभ्योऽपि मतोऽधिकः ।
कर्मिभ्यश्चाधिको योगी तस्माद्योगी भवार्जुन ॥ ६-४६॥
tapasvibhyoadhiko YogaI jnAnibhyoapi matoadhikaH 
karmibhyashchAdhiko YogaI tasmAdYogaI bhavArjuna  6.46

A Yogi is superior to the tapasvī (an ascetic), superior to the jñānī (a person of knowledge), and even superior to the karmī (a person of action). Therefore, O Arjuna, strive to be a Yogi.

योगिनामपि सर्वेषां मद्गतेनान्तरात्मना ।

Even among all the Yogis, those whose minds are always absorbed in me, and who are constantly established in my very sense of self, them I consider to be the highest of all.

And thus ends the sixth chapter, by the name of Atmasamyama yogaH.
This is taken from Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of Yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality, called as brahma vidya.
