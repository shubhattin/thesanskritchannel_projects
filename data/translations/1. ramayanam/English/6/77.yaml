  Now, in the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  seventy-seventh chapter, called “The Slaying of Nikumbha.”
'1': >-
  Nikumbha, seeing his brother struck down by Sugrīva, looked upon the lord of
  the Vānaras, as though he were burning with wrath.
'2': >-
  Then that steadfast warrior took up a splendid iron club (parigha), bound with
  garlands and festoons, auspicious, and furnished with five finger-breadths (as
  a grip), resembling a peak of great Indra’s mountain.
'3': >-
  It was encircled with bands of gold, adorned with diamond-like hardness and
  coral-like ornaments—terrible, like Yama’s staff of punishment, and a
  destroyer of fear for the Rākṣasas.
'4': >-
  Wielding it, that mighty, greatly radiant Nikumbha—whose energy was equal to
  Indra’s banner—roared aloud, his mouth wide open, he of dreadful prowess.
'5': >-
  With a breast-ornament upon his chest, with armlets and bracelets upon his
  arms, with wondrous earrings, and with a garland richly variegated,
'6': >-
  Nikumbha shone with those ornaments and with that very club—like a cloud that
  glitters with Indra’s bow, accompanied by lightning and thunder.
'7': >-
  At the point of the club there burst forth a mighty, wind-whirled blaze; it
  flared up with a loud sound, like smokeless fire.
'8': >-
  With the city and its tree-crowned avenues, with its excellent mansions like
  the dwellings of Gandharvas, with the hosts of stars and constellations, with
  the moon and the great planets—everything seemed to whirl as though in the sky
  itself, under the sweep of Nikumbha’s spinning club.
'9': >-
  Hard to approach he became, glowing with the splendor of his club as an
  ornament; the fire of Nikumbha, fed by the fuel of wrath, rose up like the
  fire at the end of an age.
'10': >-
  Both the Rākṣasas and the Vānaras were unable even to stir, out of fear; but
  mighty Hanumān, baring his chest, stood firm at the very front.
'11': >-
  Nikumbha, whose arms were like clubs, brought down upon that mighty one’s
  chest a club blazing with the radiance of the sun.
'12': >-
  But when it struck upon his broad and steadfast chest, that club was shattered
  into a hundred pieces, scattering suddenly like a hundred meteors in the sky.
'13': >-
  Yet by that blow the great monkey did not move at all—though struck with the
  club—like a mountain unmoved even when the earth trembles.
'14': >-
  Thus smitten by him, Hanumān, foremost among those who leap, of exceeding
  might, gathered his fist with strength.
'15': >-
  Lifting it up, the radiant and valorous one—swift as the wind in his
  onset—hurled it with speed upon Nikumbha’s chest.
'16': >-
  Thereupon his armor burst open and blood flowed forth; by that fist the flash
  arose as lightning rises within a cloud.
'17': >-
  By that blow Nikumbha reeled; yet, regaining himself, he seized mighty
  Hanumān.
'18': >-
  Then the dwellers of Laṅkā cried out terribly in that battle, seeing mighty
  Hanumān held fast by Nikumbha.
'19': >-
  Even while he was being borne and restrained by that Rākṣasa, Hanumān, son of
  the Wind, struck him with a fist like a thunderbolt.
'20': >-
  Then, freeing himself, he sprang down upon the ground; and at once Hanumān,
  the son of Māruta, lifted up Nikumbha.
'21': >-
  Casting him down with utmost force, he crushed Nikumbha; and then, leaping up,
  the swift one fell with speed upon his chest.
'22': >-
  Then, seizing him with both arms, twisting around his neck and the line of his
  head, he tore off his head, while the fearful one roared loudly.
'23': >-
  And when Nikumbha was felled and roaring, in that battle the combat became
  most dreadful—between the son of the Wind and the son of the lord of the
  Rākṣasas, both inflamed with exceeding rage.
'24': >-
  But when Nikumbha’s life had departed, the Plavaṅgas rejoiced and roared on
  all sides with resounding cries; the earth seemed to quake, the sky seemed to
  fall, and fear entered the hosts of the Rākṣasas, and their strength was
  broken.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-seventh chapter, called “The Slaying of Nikumbha,” in
  the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
