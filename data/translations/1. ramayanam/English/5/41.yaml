  Now begins the Forty-first Sarga of the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Rending of the Pleasure-Grove
  (Pramadā-vana-bhañjana).”
'1': >-
  And that vānar (Hanumān), about to depart from that place, being honored by
  her (Sītā) with words of praise, withdrew from that region and began to
  reflect.
'2': >-
  “This task is now but little remaining; the dark-eyed lady has been seen.
  Having not transgressed the three methods, a fourth is now to be employed
  here.
'3': >-
  “Conciliation (sāma) does not suit the rākṣasas as a means to good; gifts
  (dāna) are not fitting for those who are already swollen with wealth; those
  who are intoxicated with strength cannot be brought to submission by division
  (bheda). Therefore this course—valor (parākrama)—is what pleases me here.
'4': >-
  “And in this undertaking, no clear resolve can be established without valor.
  If the rākṣasas, whose foremost heroes have been slain in battle, should today
  somehow come to softness or meekness here—how could that ever be?”
'5': >-
  “He is fit to accomplish a task who, when engaged in an enterprise and having
  brought it to completion, can also carry out many other things—without coming
  into conflict with the earlier work.
'6': >-
  “For not even for a small act here is there only a single means that
  accomplishes it. He who understands an objective in many ways—he is competent
  in securing that objective.
'7': >-
  “Here itself, having come to a firm decision, I should go today to the abode
  of the Lord of the Plavagas (Sugrīva). Knowing precisely the special truth of
  the clash of mighty selves (the conflict of great powers), then my master’s
  command will indeed have been fulfilled by me.”
'8': >-
  “How indeed might it come to pass today that, by force, a battle with the
  rākṣasas befall me as a pleasing occurrence? Then, truly, Rāvaṇa (the
  Ten-faced one) would also bring me into battle, along with the full essence of
  his own strength.”
'9': >-
  “Then, having met in battle with the Ten-faced one, together with his circle
  of counselors, with his forces and attendants, and having easily understood
  the intent settled in his heart as well as his strength, I shall return from
  here once again.”
'10': >-
  “This is that excellent grove of this cruel one (Rāvaṇa), supreme like Nandana
  (Indra’s garden)—a delight to the eyes and to the mind, filled with many kinds
  of trees and creepers.”
'11': >-
  “This I shall lay waste, as fire consumes a dry forest. When this has been
  shattered, then Rāvaṇa will surely be roused to wrath.”
'12': >-
  “Thereafter the lord of the rākṣasas will bring forth a great army with
  horses, mighty chariots, and elephants—bearing weapons of tridents, black iron
  clubs, and spears; then this battle will become immense.”
'13': >-
  “And I, unbroken in prowess, shall meet those rākṣasas in combat—fierce in
  valor—and, having slain that host urged on by Rāvaṇa, shall go in comfort to
  the dwelling of the lord of the monkeys (Sugrīva).”
'14': >-
  “Then Māruti (Hanumān), wrathful like the wind itself, of dreadful prowess,
  began to hurl trees with a great surge of his thigh-force.”
'15': >-
  “Thereupon that heroic Hanumān shattered the pleasure-grove (Pramadā-vana),
  resounding with the cries of intoxicated birds, filled with varied trees and
  creepers.”
'16': >-
  “That forest, with its trees crushed and churned, its ponds and
  water-reservoirs split open, and its mountain-peaks pulverized, became a sight
  most unpleasant to behold.”
'17': >-
  “With the calls of many kinds of birds, with water-reservoirs burst and
  overflowing, with copper-red tender shoots worn and withered, and with
  exhausted trees and creepers—thus it stood.”
'18': >-
  “That forest did not appear there as though merely scorched by a forest-fire;
  its creepers, their coverings disordered, shone forth in confusion, as if
  faint and distraught.”
'19': >-
  “With bowers of creepers and delightful pavilions brought down; with serpents,
  deer, and birds crying out in distress; with rock-built halls and other
  dwellings torn up— that great forest’s form was utterly ruined.”
'20': >-
  “That woodland—once spread with flowering creepers—became a tract of creepers
  overwhelmed by agitation and grief, by the sheer might of the monkey, in that
  Pramadā-vana belonging to the ten-faced one; indeed, in that very
  pleasure-grove.”
'21': >-
  “Then, having committed a great offense against the magnanimous lord of the
  earth (Rāvaṇa), the mighty monkey—desiring battle, alone against many of great
  strength, blazing with splendor—took his stand upon the gateway (toraṇa).”
'22': >-
  “Thus ends the Forty-first Sarga of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first poet, entitled “The Rending
  of the Pleasure-Grove (Pramadā-vana-bhañjana).”
