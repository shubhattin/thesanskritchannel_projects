  Now begins the fourteenth canto in the Kishkindha-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, entitled “Sugriva’s Roaring.”
'1': >-
  All of them, going swiftly to Kishkindha, the city of Vali, concealed
  themselves by covering their bodies with trees and stood waiting within the
  dense forest.
'2': >-
  Then Sugriva—broad-necked, and fond of the woods—casting his gaze on every
  side through the woodland, took up fierce wrath within himself.
'3': >-
  Thereupon, making a dreadful roar, he challenged Vali to battle; surrounded by
  his attendants, with his cries he seemed to rend the very firmament.
'4': >-
  Roaring like a great cloud driven onward by the speed of the wind, shining
  like the newly risen sun, and moving with the proud gait of a lion, he
  advanced.
'5': >-
  Beholding Rama, skillful in action, Sugriva spoke these words—(standing
  before) Kishkindha, adorned with golden gateways and spread about with snares
  set for monkeys.
'6': >-
  “We have reached Kishkindha, the city of Vali, rich with banners and engines
  (of defense). O hero, the pledge that you formerly made for Vali’s slaying—”
'7': >-
  “Make that promise quickly come to fruition; time has come upon us like Death
  itself.” Thus addressed by Sugriva, that righteous-souled Raghava—
'8': >-
  the slayer of foes—spoke these words to Sugriva: “You have been furnished with
  a mark of recognition by this creeper named Gaja-sahvaya.
'9': >-
  Torn up by Lakshmana, it has been placed about your neck. Indeed, O hero, you
  shine all the more with this creeper fastened to your throat.
'10': >-
  Like the sun in the sky set in contrast with a garland of stars, today, O
  monkey, the fear and the enmity that arise from Vali are yours.
'11': >-
  With a single discharge of an arrow in the battle, I shall set you free (from
  that fear and enmity). Show me, O Sugriva, your enemy—one who wears the form
  of a brother.
'12': >-
  So long as Vali, when struck down, writhes in the dust of the forest—if,
  having come within the range of sight, he should turn back still alive—
'13': >-
  then through my fault he would return, and you would straightway reproach me.
  Yet plainly, seven sala trees have been split by my arrow.
'14': >-
  By that strength, know this day that Vali will be slain in battle. Never
  before have I spoken untruth, even while long abiding in hardship.
'15': >-
  Nor shall I ever speak falsely, even under the sway of greed for righteousness
  (or any pretext of dharma). I shall make the pledge successful—cast away your
  agitation.
'16': >-
  As Shatakratu (Indra) causes a field to bring forth a crop by rain, so too let
  the summons be made—the challenge that is the occasion for calling out Vali,
  he who is garlanded with gold.
'17': >-
  “O Sugriva, utter that cry by which the monkey will rush out—he who boasts of
  victory, prides himself on conquest, and was formerly insulted by you.
'18': >-
  Vali, delighting in battle, will spring forth at once and without hesitation;
  for warriors, hearing that their enemies have insulted them, do not endure it
  in the midst of combat,
'19': >-
  knowing their own valor—especially before women.” Having heard Rama’s words,
  Sugriva, golden-brown in hue,
'20': >-
  roared with a savage roar, as though splitting the sky; there, terrified by
  that sound, the cows went away, their luster gone.
'21': >-
  And women of noble families fled in confusion, like women distressed by a
  king’s wrongdoing; deer ran quickly, like horses broken and fleeing from
  battle; and birds fell to the earth like planets whose merit is exhausted.
'22': >-
  Then he—whose thunderous sound was like that made by clouds—hurriedly released
  that roar, as though urged on: the son of the Sun, his radiance increased by
  valor, like the lord of rivers (the ocean) whose wind-tossed waves are
  restless.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the fourteenth canto of the Kishkindha-kanda in the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the primeval epic, entitled “Sugriva’s Roaring.”
