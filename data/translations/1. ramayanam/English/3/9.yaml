  Now begins the ninth canto in the Aranya-kanda of the glorious Valmiki
  Ramayana, entitled “Sita’s Communication of Dharma.”
'1': >-
  Having taken leave of Sutikshna and set forth, the delighter of the Raghus,
  Rama, was addressed by his wife with words that were pleasing to the heart and
  full of affection.
'2': >-
  Great adharma is brought about through a procedure that is exceedingly subtle;
  and by one who has turned back (from it), it is possible here to withdraw from
  calamity that arises from desire.
'3': >-
  Here, indeed, there are three misfortunes that are born of desire; and among
  them false speech is the foremost—therefore the other two are even more
  weighty (in consequence).
'4': >-
  Consorting with another’s wife, and cruelty without enmity—these; but
  falsehood in speech has not been in you, nor shall it ever be, O Raghava.
'5': >-
  How could there be in you any longing for the wives of others—(an act) that
  brings about the ruin of dharma? In you this does not exist, O lord among men,
  nor has it ever been in you at any time.
'6': >-
  Even in the mind, O Rama, this is not found anywhere in you; and you are ever
  devoted only to your own wife, O prince.
'7': >-
  You are most righteous, firmly established in truth, and an executor of your
  father’s command. In you dharma and truth—indeed everything—stands well
  founded.
'8': >-
  And all that, O mighty-armed one, can be borne and upheld by those who have
  conquered their senses; and your mastery over the senses I know, O you of
  auspicious countenance.
'9': >-
  But the third—this wrathful course of action, namely the harming of another’s
  life—when done without enmity, arises from delusion; and that has now come
  before you.
'10': >-
  For you have vowed, O hero, the slaying in battle of the rakshasas dwelling in
  the Dandaka forest, for the sake of protecting the rishis.
'11': >-
  And for this reason the forest is famed by the name ‘Dandaka’; and you have
  set out together with your brother, holding your bow and arrows.
'12': >-
  Then, seeing you thus departed, my mind becomes distressed with anxiety; and
  while thinking over your conduct, what is for your highest good and welfare
  would come to be (clear to me).
'13': >-
  For, O hero, I do not approve your going toward the Dandaka forest. I shall
  tell the reason for that; listen to me as I speak.
'14': >-
  You, with bow and arrows in hand, have gone to the forest along with your
  brother; upon seeing all the forest-dwellers, might you perhaps cause an
  expenditure of arrows?
'15': >-
  For warriors of the kshatriya order, here, the bow is like fuel for the fire:
  when its fiery energy and strength stand close at hand, they blaze up
  exceedingly.
'16': >-
  Formerly indeed, O mighty-armed one, there was a certain ascetic—truthful and
  pure—who dwelt in some holy forest, abounding in deer and birds.
'17': >-
  Indra, the lord of Shachi, wishing to obstruct that very austerity, came to
  the hermitage with a sword in his hand, assuming the guise of a warrior.
'18': >-
  At that hermitage-site, that excellent sword was deposited; it was given
  according to the rite of entrusting a deposit, while the ascetic stood firm in
  his holy austerity.
'19': >-
  Having received that weapon, intent on guarding the entrusted deposit, he
  continued to wander in the forest, safeguarding his own trustworthiness.
'20': >-
  Wherever he went to gather roots and fruits, he did not go without that sword,
  being wholly intent on protecting the deposit.
'21': >-
  Constantly carrying the weapon, in due course that possessor of penance
  fashioned in himself a wrathful disposition, abandoning his resolve that was
  fixed upon austerity.
'22': >-
  Thereupon, given to wrath, negligent, and drawn along by adharma, that
  sage—through his association with that weapon—went to hell.
'23': >-
  Thus this is an occurrence of old, having weapon-association as its cause. As
  in the case of association with fire, association with weapons is said to be a
  cause (of such downfall).
'24': >-
  Out of affection and out of esteem I remind you, to instruct you: by you, who
  have taken up the bow, this must not be done in any manner.
'25': >-
  To slay the rakshasas resorting to the Dandaka forest without any
  enmity—(such) an intention to kill without an offence—people, O hero, will not
  approve.
'26': >-
  But for heroic kshatriyas who are self-restrained in forests, the use of the
  bow is only so much as this: the protection of those who are afflicted.
'27': >-
  Where is a weapon, and where is a forest? Where is kshatriya conduct, and
  where is asceticism? By us this has been confounded; let the dharma of the
  land be honoured.
'28': >-
  A miserly and tainted disposition arises from the practice of weapons. Having
  returned again to Ayodhya, you will practise the dharma of a kshatriya.
'29': >-
  Unfailing would be my joy toward my mother-in-law and father-in-law, if—having
  renounced kingship—you were to become a sage, devoted (to the ascetic path).
'30': >-
  From dharma arises prosperity; from dharma arises happiness. By dharma one
  attains everything; this world has dharma as its very essence.
'31': >-
  Having disciplined and restrained oneself by various observances with earnest
  effort, dharma is attained by the skilful; happiness is not gained from mere
  comfort and pleasure.
'32': >-
  Ever pure in mind, O gentle one, practise dharma in the forest of austerity.
  Indeed, to you everything is known in its true nature, even across the three
  worlds.
'33': >-
  From womanly fickleness this has been brought forward by me; and who indeed is
  competent to teach you dharma? Yet, after considering with your own
  understanding, together with your younger brother, do without delay that which
  pleases you.
'34': >-
  Thus ends the ninth canto of the Aranya-kanda in the holy Valmiki Ramayana,
  the Adi-kavya, entitled “Sita’s Communication of Dharma.”
