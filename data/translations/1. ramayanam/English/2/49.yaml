  Now begins the forty-ninth sarga (chapter), named “The Lamentation and Censure
  of the Country-folk (Jānapadākrōśa)”, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Rāma also, when only a small part of the night still remained, covered that
  great distance by that very time—he, the tiger among men—ever keeping in
  remembrance his father’s command.
'2': >-
  As he went on in that manner, the auspicious night passed away; and having
  performed the auspicious twilight worship, he entered the outskirts of the
  realm.
'3': >-
  Beholding villages whose boundaries lay far apart, and forests in bloom with
  flowers, he swiftly passed on, as though shot forth by arrows—borne by
  excellent horses.
'4': >-
  And he heard the words of men dwelling in the village settlements: “Fie upon
  King Daśaratha, who has come under the sway of desire!”
'5': >-
  “Alas! Today Kaikeyī is truly cruel—sinful, ever attended by sin; sharp and
  transgressing all bounds of propriety, she is engaged in a harsh deed.”
'6': >-
  “She who sends into exile the king’s son—such a righteous one—into
  forest-dwelling: that great in wisdom, compassionate, ever-vigilant prince.”
'7': >-
  “How indeed will the highly fortunate Sītā, Janaka’s beloved daughter—always
  devoted to comforts—now undergo sufferings?”
'8': >-
  “Ah! King Daśaratha is without affection—though Rāma is dear as his own
  son—yet he wishes to abandon here Rāma, the blameless one of the people.”
'9': >-
  Hearing these words of the men dwelling in the village settlements, the hero
  went swiftly onward—the lord of Kosala, through the lands of Kosala.
'10': >-
  Then he crossed the river named Vedaśruti, that auspicious stream-bearing
  river; and having crossed it, he proceeded facing the direction inhabited by
  Agastya.
'11': >-
  Having gone for a long time thereafter, he crossed the cool-watered river
  Gomati—abounding in cattle and rich with low-lying marshy tracts—flowing on
  towards the ocean.
'12': >-
  And having also passed beyond the Gomati, Rāghava, urged on by swift horses,
  crossed the river Syandikā, resonant with the cries of peacocks and swans.
'13': >-
  Thereupon Rāma showed Vaidehī the land which King Manu had formerly bestowed
  upon Ikṣvāku—prosperous and encompassed by a well-ordered realm.
'14': >-
  And repeatedly addressing that charioteer, the illustrious bull among men,
  whose voice was pleasing like the call of an intoxicated swan, spoke thus:
'15': >-
  “When shall I return again and, together with my mother and father, roam about
  in the flowering forest on the banks of the Sarayū for the joy of the hunt?”
'16': >-
  “I do not yearn excessively for hunting in the Sarayū forest; for this delight
  is incomparable in the world, and is approved by the hosts of royal seers.”
'17': >-
  “Indeed, in this world, for royal seers, hunting in the forest—done at the
  proper season—has been desired by men who bear the bow, as a source of
  recreation.”
'18': >-
  Thus, the son of Ikṣvāku (Rāma), understanding the charioteer’s intention, and
  addressing Sumantra on that journey with sweet speech, proceeded while
  uttering these words.
'19': >-
  Thus ends the forty-ninth sarga, named “The Lamentation and Censure of the
  Country-folk (Jānapadākrōśa)”, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
