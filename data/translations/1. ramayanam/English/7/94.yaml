'0': >-
  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninety-fourth canto, named “The Singing of the Rāmāyaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Then, when the night had dawned into morning, having bathed and having duly
  offered oblations into the sacred fire, those two, as the sage had formerly
  instructed, sang there everything in the prescribed manner.
'2': >-
  Kākutstha (Rāma) heard that composition—crafted by the earlier
  preceptors—unprecedented in its mode of recitation and adorned with melody as
  befits song.
'3': >-
  Bound together with many measures and standards, endowed with the
  accompaniment of the vīṇā’s stringing and the harmony of rhythm and
  tempo—hearing it from the two boys, Rāghava was filled with keen curiosity.
'4': >-
  Then, in an interval of royal business, the king—best among men—summoned great
  sages, and also earthly princes, and learned men skilled in the Vedas and
  traditional lore.
'5': >-
  He summoned also Purāṇic narrators, experts in sound and words, and aged
  twice-born Brāhmaṇas; and those best of Brāhmaṇas who were eager and who knew
  the characteristics of the notes (svaras).
'6': >-
  He summoned experts in prosody and definition, and Gandharva-trained musicians
  especially, along with learned Vedic scholars; those who understood feet,
  syllables, and compounds, and who were firmly established in the science of
  metres.
'7': >-
  He summoned those who knew the fine distinctions of artistic units and
  measures, and those who had attained excellence in astronomy/astrology; as
  well as men versed in ritual procedure and men skilled in practical affairs.
'8': >-
  He summoned those who knew languages and could read gestures and indications,
  and Vedic scholars without exception; those adept in reasoning and customary
  applications, and those who were also logical and discerning in speech.
'9': >-
  He summoned knowers of metres, knowers of the Purāṇas, Vedic scholars, the
  best among the twice-born; those skilled in various arts, those who knew
  treatises on rhythm and movement, and those accomplished in song and dance.
'10': >-
  He summoned experts in the śāstras, those proficient in polity and right
  conduct, and those who could expound the purport of Vedānta; gathering all
  these, he caused the two singers to be seated in the assembly.
'11': >-
  Seeing the two singers along with the king, all the companies of sages and the
  mighty princes gazed, as though drinking with their eyes.
'12': >-
  And all of them, on every side, said to one another: “These two are alike to
  Rāma—like an image arisen from an image.”
'13': >-
  “If they were not matted-haired, and if they were not clad in bark garments,
  we would perceive no difference at all between these singers and Rāghava.”
'14': >-
  While they thus conversed, to the delight and increase of joy of the
  listeners, those two sons of the sage then began to render the song there.
'15': >-
  Then there commenced a sweet Gandharva-style singing, more than human in
  excellence; and all the listeners, by reason of the wealth of that song, still
  did not attain satiety.
'16': >-
  Beginning from the very first canto—such as Nārada had shown—thereafter they
  sang the successive cantos, up to twenty.
'17': >-
  Then, at the time of the afternoon, Rāghava spoke—he who was affectionate
  toward his brothers—having heard those twenty cantos, addressing his brother.
'18': >-
  “Give swiftly, O Kākutstha, to those two great-souled boys eighteen thousand
  (pieces) of gold, and whatever else is desired.” Thus that Kākutstha promptly
  gave—separately to each of the two boys.
'19': >-
  But Kuśa and Lava did not accept the gold that was being given. Those
  great-souled ones, astonished, said, “What is the use of this?”
'20': >-
  “Dwelling in the forest, engaged with wild fruits and roots as our fare—what
  shall we do in the forest with gold and wealth?”
'21': >-
  As they spoke thus, all the listeners—and Rāma as well—were filled with wonder
  and curiosity.
'22': >-
  Then Rāma, eager to hear of the very origin of that poem, asked those two
  radiant sons of the sage.
'23': >-
  “What is the measure and authority of this poem? What is the foundation
  (standing) of this great work? Who is the maker of this mighty kāvya, and
  where is that foremost of sages?”
'24': Thus questioned by Rāghava in words, the two sons of the sage replied.
'25': >-
  “The Blessed Lord Vālmīki is its author; he has come here, having reached the
  arrangements of the sacrifice—he by whom your entire history has been shown to
  you without remainder.”
'26': >-
  “Indeed it has been well composed as a collection of twenty-four thousand
  ślokas, and also of a hundred episodes—(set forth) by the ascetic Bhārgava.”
'27': >-
  “From the beginning, O King, there are five hundred cantos; six kāṇḍas have
  been made here by the great-souled one, together with their appended portions.
  Your whole history has been composed by our guru, the sage.”
'28': “Its standing and its life endure so long as all beings endure.”
'29': >-
  “Together with the appended portions, composed by the great-souled one—if, O
  King, O great charioteer, your mind is set upon hearing it, then, in the
  intervals of your duties, when time is available, listen to it along with your
  younger brother.”
'30': >-
  Rāma said, “So be it.” And having taken leave of Rāghava, those two,
  delighted, went to the place where the foremost of sages was staying.
'31': >-
  Rāma too, along with the sages and the great-souled princes, having heard the
  sweetness of that singing, went to the hall of rites and works (the
  sacrificial enclosure).
'32': >-
  He heard it—complete with rhythm and tempo, structured by cantos, endowed with
  notes and words, joined with the vīṇā’s time-keeping and the expressive
  articulations—being fully sung by Kuśa and Lava.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-fourth canto, named “The Singing of the Rāmāyaṇa,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
