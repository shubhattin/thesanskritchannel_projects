  Now begins the thirtieth canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Account of the Cause of Indra’s Defeat.”
'1': >-
  When Mahendra (Indra), the exceedingly mighty one, had been conquered by the
  son of Rāvaṇa, the gods—having Prajāpati (Brahmā) at their head—then proceeded
  to Laṅkā.
'2': >-
  There, approaching Rāvaṇa who was surrounded by his sons and brothers,
  Prajāpati, remaining stationed in the sky, spoke to him with words of
  conciliation, gentle and harmonious.
'3': >-
  “My child, O Rāvaṇa, I am pleased with your son in battle. Indeed, wondrous is
  his valor and noble spirit—equal to yours, or even surpassing it.”
'4': >-
  “By your own splendor you have truly conquered the entire triple world. The
  vow has been made fruitful; I am delighted with my own son indeed.”
'5': >-
  “And this son of yours, O Rāvaṇa—exceedingly strong and heroic—shall become
  renowned in the world by the name ‘Indrajit’ (Conqueror of Indra).”
'6': >-
  “That rākṣasa will surely be mighty and hard to overcome; relying upon him, O
  king, the gods have been brought under your control.”
'7': >-
  “Therefore, O great-armed one, let Mahendra, the chastiser of Pāka, be
  released. And for the sake of his release, let the inhabitants of heaven grant
  what is due.”
'8': >-
  Then the great-splendored Indrajit, the conqueror in battle, spoke: “O god, I
  choose immortality—if this one is set free.”
'9': >-
  “Of quadrupeds, of those that move in the sky (birds and the like), and of
  other beings of great might—of trees, shrubs, bushes, creepers, grasses,
  stones, and mountains—”
'10': >-
  “—all creatures, whenever there is cause for mutual fear, are afraid of one
  another. Therefore, in this world, for all beings there would arise fear from
  everything and from everyone.”
'11': >-
  Then the great-splendored Prajāpati said to Meghānāda (Indrajit): “For no
  living being upon earth does complete immortality exist—whether among
  quadrupeds, birds, or other mighty creatures.”
'12': Hearing the imperishable ordinance spoken by the Grandsire (Brahmā), Indrajit—
'13': >-
  —then that mighty Meghānāda, standing there, said: “Let it be heard, then, how
  success may be attained in the releasing of Śatakratu (Indra).”
'14': >-
  “I have my desired rite ever performed—worshipping the sacred Fire with
  oblations and mantras—while wishing to enter battle and to conquer the foe.”
'15': >-
  “Let a chariot yoked with horses rise up for me from Vibhāvasu (Agni). While
  standing upon it, let immortality be mine—this is the boon that is my settled
  resolve.”
'16': >-
  “But if, while the muttered prayer and the fire-offering to Vibhāvasu are
  still unfinished, I should fight, O god, in battle—then for me there would be
  destruction.”
'17': >-
  “For indeed, O god, a man attains immortality by austerity; and by my own
  prowess this immortality has been set in motion (as the boon I seek).”
'18': >-
  “So be it,” said the god, the Grandsire, to him. And Śakra was released by
  Indrajit; and the gods returned to the third heaven.
'19': >-
  In the meantime, O Rāma, Indra—dejected, his luster and radiance diminished,
  his mind overwhelmed with anxiety—fell into deep contemplation.
'20': >-
  Seeing him in that condition, the god Prajāpati spoke: “O Śatakratu, what
  grievous misdeed did you formerly commit?”
'21': >-
  “O lord of the immortals, O master: I created many beings; all were of one
  hue, of like speech, and everywhere of one and the same form.”
'22': >-
  “In their appearance and even in their distinguishing marks there was no
  difference at all. Then, with a concentrated mind, I reflected upon those
  creatures.”
'23': >-
  “Thereupon, for the sake of producing distinction among them, I fashioned one
  woman; whatever was distinctive in each limb of the creatures, that and that I
  drew forth.”
'24': >-
  “Then, by me, that woman Ahalyā was created with beauty and excellent
  qualities. ‘Hala’ is spoken of here as deformity; and ‘halya’ would arise from
  that.”
'25': >-
  “Because in her there was no ‘halya’ (deformity), therefore she became
  renowned as ‘Ahalyā’ (the non-deformed). This name ‘Ahalyā’ I, O Śakra,
  established for her.”
'26': >-
  “And when that woman was created, O lord of the gods, bull among the suras,
  this thought then arose in me: ‘Whose shall she become?’”
'27': >-
  “But you, O Śakra, knew that woman in your mind, O lord; and, by a sense of
  superiority of station, you thought, ‘She shall be my wife,’ O Purandara.”
'28': >-
  “Yet she was entrusted by me to the great-souled Gautama; entrusted for many
  years, she was also protected by him indeed.”
'29': >-
  “Then, discerning the great steadiness of that great sage, and knowing his
  perfection in austerity, you touched her, desiring her as a wife.”
'30': >-
  “And you—provoked to anger, O righteous one—went to the sage’s hermitage; and
  there you beheld that woman, blazing like the flame of fire.”
'31': >-
  “She was violated by you, O Śakra, when you were afflicted by desire and
  carried away by passion; and you were then seen in the hermitage by that
  supreme seer.”
'32': >-
  “Thereafter, in wrath, that most splendid sage cursed you; because of that, O
  lord of the gods, you came to a reversal of your condition and honor.”
'33': >-
  “‘Because my wife was violated by you, O Vāsava, without fear, therefore, O
  king, in battle you shall fall into the enemy’s hand.’”
'34': >-
  “‘And this evil course, O foolish-minded one, which you have set in motion
  here, shall also come to be among the worlds of men—there is no doubt.’”
'35': >-
  “‘Half of that (evil) of which he is the doer shall fall upon you as your
  half; and for you there shall not be a fixed, stable station—there is no
  doubt.’”
'36': >-
  “‘And whoever may become the lord of the gods, he shall not be permanent (in
  that office); this curse have I released.’ Thus did that sage speak to you
  then.”
'37': >-
  “And he censured his wife and spoke, that great ascetic: ‘O ill-disciplined
  one, depart—be gone from the vicinity of my hermitage!’”
'38': >-
  “‘Since you, though endowed with beauty and youth, did not remain steadfast,
  therefore you shall not be the only beautiful woman in the world.’”
'39': >-
  “‘And all creatures shall partake of your beauty—there is no doubt—for relying
  upon that single excellence, this delusion has come to pass.’”
'40': >-
  “From that time onward, creatures were, for the most part, endowed with
  beauty. Then she sought to appease that great sage Gautama.”
'41': >-
  “‘O brāhmaṇa, through ignorance I was violated by a denizen of heaven who took
  on your form; it was not out of my own desire, O best of seers. You ought to
  grant me grace.’”
'42': >-
  Thus addressed by Ahalyā, Gautama replied: “A great-splendored mahāratha shall
  be born among the Ikṣvākus.”
'43': >-
  “Rāma by name, famed in the world; and he shall also go to the
  forest—great-armed, Viṣṇu in human form—for the sake of the brāhmaṇas. When
  you behold him, O blessed one, then you shall be purified.”
'44': >-
  “For he is able to cleanse the evil deed that was done by you; and after
  honoring him as a guest, you shall come into my presence.”
'45': >-
  “Then, O woman of lovely complexion, you shall dwell together with me.” Having
  spoken thus, that best of sages returned to his own hermitage.
'46': >-
  Then she, the wife of that brāhmaṇa-proclaimer, practiced very great
  austerity; for all this befell through the sage’s releasing of the curse.
'47': >-
  “Therefore remember, O great-armed one, the misdeed that was committed by you.
  By that you were taken captive by the enemy, O Vāsava—not by any other cause.”
'48': >-
  “Quickly perform a Vaiṣṇava sacrifice, well-composed and intent. Purified by
  that sacrifice, you shall thereafter go to the third heaven.”
'49': >-
  “And your son, O lord of the gods, has not perished in the great battle; he
  has been carried away and kept safe by your maternal grandsire in the great
  ocean.”
'50': >-
  Hearing this, Mahendra performed the Vaiṣṇava sacrifice; then the divine king
  again ascended the third heaven and ruled in due course.
'51': >-
  Such is the power of Indrajit that has been described by me. By him the lord
  of the gods was conquered—what then of other living beings?
'52': >-
  Then Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa said, “It is wondrous!” Hearing Agastya’s words, the
  Vānaras and the Rākṣasas were struck with amazement.
'53': >-
  But Vibhīṣaṇa, standing at Rāma’s side, spoke: “It is wondrous; today I have
  been reminded of what was seen long ago.”
'54': 'Rāma spoke to Agastya: “This is true; I too have heard this (account).”'
'55': >-
  “Thus, O Rāma, was Rāvaṇa born—the thorn of the worlds—he by whose son, in
  battle, Śakra, the lord of the gods, was conquered.”
'56': >-
  Thus ends the thirtieth canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Account of the Cause of Indra’s
  Defeat.”
