  Now, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins
  the twenty-second chapter, named “The Binding of the Bridge (Setubandha).”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, the best of the Raghus, spoke a dreadful word to the ocean: “Today
  I shall dry you up, O great sea, together with even the nether regions
  (Pātāla)!”
'2': >-
  “When your waters are scorched by arrows and you are utterly dried up, O
  Ocean—when the creatures within you have been destroyed by me—then a vast
  expanse of dust shall arise.”
'3': >-
  “With the shower of arrows released from my bow, O Ocean, the monkeys shall go
  to the farther shore even on foot.”
'4': >-
  “While you search (and delay), you do not recognize my manliness, nor my
  prowess; you shall learn from me the torment of the abode of the Dānavas (the
  netherworld).”
'5': >-
  Then the mighty one fitted an arrow, resembling the rod of Brahmā (the
  Brahma-daṇḍa), to the Brahmā-weapon, and placing it upon his excellent bow, he
  drew it back.
'6': >-
  As that bow was drawn at once by Rāghava, the very two worlds (heaven and
  earth) seemed to split asunder, and the mountains trembled.
'7': >-
  Darkness covered the world, and the दिशः (the quarters) did not shine; lakes
  and rivers too were quickly agitated and churned in turmoil.
'8': >-
  The sun and the moon, together with the stars, appeared to move crosswise; the
  sky blazed with the sun’s rays and yet was enveloped in darkness.
'9': >-
  Then the firmament shone as though illuminated by hundreds of meteors; and
  from mid-air issued thunderclaps of incomparable sound.
'10': >-
  Rows of divine winds blew with great force; again and again they broke trees,
  lifting up masses of water-clouds (rain-bearing clouds).
'11': >-
  They shattered mountain-peaks and broke the summits; and in the heavens great
  clouds gathered together, roaring mightily.
'12': >-
  Those great clouds then sent forth lightning-fires and terrible thunderbolts;
  and all beings that were visible cried out like the thunder.
'13': >-
  Even invisible beings released fearsome cries; overcome, they shuddered,
  terrified and trembling.
'14': >-
  They were greatly shaken, and yet through fear did not even stir—together with
  the beings, with the waters and their waves, with serpents and with rākṣasas.
'15': >-
  Then, suddenly, through the violence of that speed, the great ocean, of
  dreadful momentum, surged; in a sweeping overflow it crossed beyond its
  shoreline by a yojana, elsewhere along the coast.
'16': >-
  But though the ocean so overpassed its bounds, Rāghava—Rāma, the slayer of
  foes—did not overstep (his resolve); he held the lord of rivers and streams
  (the ocean) in check, raised up (to be struck).
'17': >-
  Then from the midst of the sea, Ocean himself rose up—like the sun arising
  from the great mountain of the eastern horizon, like the sun from Meru.
'18': >-
  The sea appeared with blazing mouths, attended by serpents; he was like
  shining vaidūrya (cat’s-eye gem), adorned with Jāmbūnada gold.
'19': >-
  Wearing red garlands and red raiment, with eyes like lotus-petals, he bore
  upon his head a divine wreath made of all flowers.
'20': >-
  He was ornamented with splendid adornments of gold and refined gold, and with
  the gems born from himself—decked with excellent jewels as ornaments.
'21': >-
  Like Himavān, a mountain adorned with many-colored minerals, he bore a
  single-stringed pearl necklace at his breast—tremulous, shining with pale
  radiance.
'22': >-
  With his broad chest he carried (the gem) like a brother of Kaustubha; around
  him whirled masses of rolling waves, thick with dark winds.
'23': >-
  He was surrounded by rivers, foremost among them Gaṅgā and Sindhu; great
  crocodiles were thrown up and turned about, and serpents and rākṣasas were
  thrown into confusion.
'24': >-
  That lord, Ocean, attended by deities of fair forms and many forms, approached
  the powerful Rāma, first saluting him with due reverence.
'25': >-
  With joined palms, he spoke these words to Rāghava, who held an arrow in his
  hand.
'26': >-
  “Earth, wind, sky, waters, and fire (light), O Rāghava—gentle one—abide in
  their own nature, following the eternal path fixed for them.”
'27': >-
  “Such too is my own nature: that I am unfathomable and not to be crossed. Yet
  a change (in me) would occur if I were made shallow—this I declare to you.”
'28': >-
  “Not from desire, nor from greed, nor from fear, O son of a king, could I in
  any way make still the water that is troubled with crocodiles and sharks.”
'29': >-
  “I shall provide the means by which you may go; I shall endure it thus as
  well. The crocodiles shall not obstruct so long as the army crosses. O Rāma,
  for the crossing of the monkeys I shall make it as though it were firm land.”
'30': >-
  Then Rāma said to him: “Hear me, O abode of Varuṇa: this mighty arrow is
  unfailing—upon what region should it be discharged?”
'31': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words and seeing that great arrow, the great ocean, possessed
  of great splendor, spoke to Rāghava.
'32': >-
  “To the north there is a certain space of mine, more sacred (than others),
  known as Drumakulyā, famed in the world—just as you yourself are famed.”
'33': >-
  “There, many robbers of fierce appearance and deeds—sinful men, with Ābhīras
  at their head—drink my water.”
'34': >-
  “I cannot bear the sinful touch of that place by those of evil deeds. Let this
  supreme, unfailing arrow, O Rāma, be directed there.”
'35': >-
  Hearing those words of the great-souled Ocean, he released that blazing arrow,
  turning it away from the sight of the sea.
'36': >-
  By that (arrow) the desert-wilderness upon the earth became indeed
  renowned—the place where the arrow fell, radiant like a thunderbolt and
  lightning.
'37': >-
  Then the earth roared there as though pained by a spike; from the mouth of
  that wound water sprang up from Rasātala (the nether depths).
'38': >-
  There then arose a well, famous by the very name “The Wound”; and the water
  that continually rose appeared like the sea’s own waters.
'39': >-
  A terrible and dreadful sound of rending came to be; by the fall of that arrow
  the waters were dried up within its belly (that region’s interior).
'40': >-
  That desert-wilderness too became renowned in the three worlds. Having dried
  up that “belly” (hollow) of the land, Rāma, son of Daśaratha…
'41': …the wise one of godlike valor bestowed a boon upon that desert.
'42': >-
  “Let it be rich in cattle, with few diseases; furnished with the juices of
  fruits and roots; abundant in fatness and abundant in milk; fragrant, with
  many kinds of medicinal herbs.”
'43': >-
  Thus endowed with these and united with many such blessings, that
  desert—through the boon granted by Rāma—became a благоприятный (auspicious)
  and safe path indeed.
'44': >-
  When that hollow had thus been scorched, Ocean, lord of rivers, spoke these
  words to Rāghava, knower of all śāstras:
'45': >-
  “This gentle one is named Nala, the son of Viśvakarman; he is illustrious, and
  by his father he has been granted a boon, beloved of Viśvakarman.”
'46': >-
  “Let this monkey, of great enterprise, build a bridge upon me; and I shall
  bear it, just as his father would (bear it).”
'47': >-
  Having spoken thus, Ocean vanished. Then Nala, the foremost of monkeys, rose
  up and spoke these words to mighty Rāma:
'48': >-
  “I shall build the bridge across the vast sea, the abode of makaras
  (sea-creatures). Having attained my father’s capability, Ocean has spoken the
  truth of it.”
'49': >-
  “Punishment alone is the true boon for a man in this world—so is my view. Fie
  upon forgiveness toward the ungrateful—whether by conciliation, by gifts, or
  otherwise!”
'50': >-
  “For this dreadful ocean, wishing to see the work of bridge-building, granted
  shallowness to Rāghava out of fear of punishment.”
'51': >-
  “A boon was given to my mother at Mandara by Viśvakarman: ‘A son like yourself
  shall be born to you, O goddess.’”
'52': >-
  “I am his true-born son, like Viśvakarman. By this, I have been reminded (of
  my power), as Ocean has declared the truth. And unless you ask, I would not
  proclaim my own merits to you.”
'53': >-
  “And I too am capable of building the bridge, O abode of Varuṇa. Therefore let
  the bull-like leaders of monkeys bind the bridge even today.”
'54': >-
  Then, released (to their task) by Rāma, the foremost of monkeys sprang up on
  every side, and in their joy, by hundreds of thousands, they leapt into the
  great forest.
'55': >-
  Those monkey-bulls, huge like mountains, broke trees there and dragged (them)
  toward the sea.
'56': >-
  Those monkeys (gathered) śāla trees and aśvakarṇa, dhava and bamboo, as well
  as kuṭaja, arjuna, tāla, tilaka, and tininśa too.
'57': >-
  With bilva trees and saptaparṇa, with flowering karṇikāra, with mango trees
  and aśoka trees, they filled the ocean.
'58': >-
  Uprooting trees both with roots and without roots, the best of monkeys lifted
  and carried them like Indra’s banner-poles, bearing the trees away.
'59': >-
  Tāla palms, pomegranate thickets, coconut and vibhītaka, karīra, bakula, and
  nimba—they gathered from here and there.
'60': >-
  Mighty ones carried huge stones the size of elephants; and uprooting even
  mountains, they bore them along by means of devices (contrivances).
'61': >-
  By the mountains suddenly being hurled in, the water was violently heaved up;
  it surged up into the sky, and then again fell back down.
'62': >-
  Falling in from every side, they churned the ocean; others seized long
  measuring-lines, extended a hundred yojanas.
'63': >-
  And Nala made the great bridge in the midst of the lord of rivers. Then that
  bridge was being built by the monkeys of dreadful labor.
'64': >-
  Some grasped posts (stakes), others searched and selected (materials); there,
  by hundreds, monkeys acted with Rāma’s command set before them.
'65': >-
  With rocks like clouds and mountains, with grass and with timber, they bound
  it; with trees whose tops were in bloom the monkeys bound the bridge.
'66': >-
  Stones like mountains and the very peaks of mountains were seen being carried
  about, seized by those who resembled Dānavas in might.
'67': >-
  As stones were being hurled and mountains dropped there, a tumultuous roar
  arose then upon that great ocean.
'68': >-
  Within the first day, fourteen yojanas were completed—by rejoicing monkeys,
  elephant-like in size, hurrying swiftly.
'69': >-
  On the second day likewise, twenty yojanas were quickly completed by the
  monkeys—terrible in body and great in strength.
'70': >-
  On the third day likewise, in the ocean twenty-one yojanas were completed by
  the hurrying, huge-bodied ones.
'71': >-
  On the fourth day likewise, twenty-two yojanas (more) were completed by those
  of great speed, working in haste then.
'72': >-
  On the fifth day likewise, by the monkeys who wrought swiftly, twenty-three
  yojanas were completed, extending up to Suvela.
'73': >-
  That illustrious and mighty leader of monkeys, Nala, the son of Viśvakarman,
  bound the bridge in the sea, just as his father would.
'74': >-
  That bridge made by Nala in the sea, the abode of makaras, shone—fair,
  illustrious, and beautiful—like the path of Svātī in the heavens.
'75': >-
  Then the gods with gandharvas, siddhas, and the supreme ṛṣis came and stood in
  the sky, desiring to behold that wonder.
'76': >-
  The gods and gandharvas beheld Nala’s bridge, extremely difficult to
  accomplish—ten yojanas broad and a hundred yojanas long.
'77': >-
  Leaping and flying and roaring, the monkeys (beheld) that unthinkable,
  unendurable wonder, causing the hair to stand on end.
'78': >-
  All beings saw the binding of the bridge in the sea—and those crores upon
  crores (countless multitudes) of monkeys of great vigor.
'79': >-
  While binding the bridge upon the sea, they went to the far shore of the great
  ocean. Vast, well-built, illustrious, with firm ground and well-aligned, it
  stood.
'80': >-
  The great bridge shone in the sea like a boundary-line (a parting in the
  hair). Then on the farther shore of the ocean stood Vibhīṣaṇa, mace in hand…
'81': …together with his counselors, stationed in order to strike down the enemies.
'82': 'Then Sugrīva spoke to Rāma, whose valor was ever true:'
'83': >-
  “You, Hanūmān, mount (and bear) Aṅgada; and you, Lakṣmaṇa (mount and bear)
  (another). For this ocean is vast, O hero, the abode of makaras.”
'84': >-
  “These two monkeys will carry you both through the sky. Glorious Rāma,
  together with Lakṣmaṇa, goes in front of that army.”
'85': >-
  The righteous-souled archer went, accompanied by Sugrīva; other monkeys went
  through the middle, and others along the flanks.
'86': >-
  Some plunged into the waters, others took to the roadway (the bridge); some
  went through the sky and leapt like Suparṇas (Garudas).
'87': >-
  With a great clamor, the clamor of the sea, risen high and dreadful, was
  swallowed up by the dreadful monkey-host as it crossed.
'88': >-
  That army of monkeys indeed crossed by Nala’s bridge. On the shore it
  encamped, in the king’s (enemy’s) land, rich in many roots and fruits and in
  water.
'89': >-
  Beholding that wondrous deed of Rāghava—so difficult to perform—the gods,
  together with siddhas and cāraṇas, approached Rāma at once; and with the great
  ṛṣis they anointed him, each with auspicious waters in due manner, and he
  shone exceedingly.
'90': >-
  “Conquer your enemies, O king among men; protect the earth together with the
  ocean for everlasting years!”—thus, honoring Rāma, revered as a lord of men,
  they worshiped him with many kinds of auspicious words.
