  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa, the twenty-seventh canto,
  called “Trijaṭā’s Dream.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by Sītā, the rākṣasī-women, their wrath inflamed, some of them
  went to report it to Rāvaṇa, that evil-souled one.
'2': >-
  Then those rākṣasīs of dreadful aspect came up to Sītā again and spoke once
  more a harsh speech, bearing one intent, though fraught with evil consequence.
'3': >-
  “Today, even now, O ignoble Sītā, O woman resolved upon sin—these rākṣasīs
  will devour this flesh of yours at their pleasure.”
'4': >-
  Seeing Sītā then threatened and terrorized by those ignoble women, the aged
  rākṣasī Trijaṭā, awakened, spoke these words:
'5': >-
  “Devour your own selves, O ignoble ones; you shall not eat Sītā—Janaka’s
  beloved daughter, and the daughter-in-law of Daśaratha.”
'6': >-
  “For today I beheld a dream—terrible and hair-raising—foretelling the
  destruction of the rākṣasas and the welfare of her lord.”
'7': >-
  Thus spoken to by Trijaṭā, the rākṣasīs, whose anger had been aflame, all of
  them, now frightened, said this to her:
'8': >-
  “Tell us what sort of dream this is that you saw in the night.” Hearing those
  words issuing from the mouths of the rākṣasī-women,
'9': >-
  Trijaṭā spoke at the proper time a speech based on her dream: “A divine
  palanquin, made as it were of elephant tusk, moving through the sky—
'10': >-
  yoked to a thousand horses—was mounted by Rāghava himself, clad in white
  garlands and white raiment, accompanied by Lakṣmaṇa.
'11': >-
  And today in a dream I saw Sītā, covered in white garments, standing upon a
  white mountain encircled by the sea.
'12': >-
  United with Rāma, Sītā shone like radiance with the Sun. And again I saw
  Rāghava upon a great elephant with four tusks—
'13': >-
  mounted on that best of elephants, huge as a mountain, he shone, together with
  Lakṣmaṇa. Then, shining like the sun, blazing with their own splendor,
'14': >-
  wearing white garlands and white raiment, they stood around Jānakī. Then, in
  front of that elephant poised in the sky,
'15': >-
  Jānakī—held close by her lord—rested upon his shoulder. Springing up from her
  husband’s lap, that lotus-eyed lady then—
'16': >-
  I saw her wiping the Moon and the Sun with her hands. Then that excellent
  elephant was ascended by those two princes, and by wide-eyed Sītā; and it
  stood above Laṅkā.
'17': >-
  Then Kakutstha himself came here with Sītā, his wife, in a chariot drawn by
  eight yoked pale bulls.
'18': >-
  Wearing white garlands and white raiment, he had come together with Lakṣmaṇa.
  Then elsewhere I saw Rāma, whose valor is true—
'19': >-
  mighty and strong, with his brother Lakṣmaṇa and with Sītā—having mounted the
  divine Puṣpaka aerial car, resplendent like the Sun,
'20': >-
  the best of men set forth, looking toward the northern direction. Thus in a
  dream I saw Rāma, whose prowess is like that of Viṣṇu.
'21': >-
  With his brother Lakṣmaṇa and with Sītā, his wife—indeed that great-tejas Rāma
  cannot be conquered by gods and asuras,
'22': >-
  nor by rākṣasas or any others—any more than heaven can be won by sinful men.
  And I saw Rāvaṇa, shaven-headed and anointed with oil,
'23': >-
  clad in red garments, drinking, intoxicated, wearing a garland made of
  karavīra flowers. Today, from the Puṣpaka aerial car, Rāvaṇa fell upon the
  earth.
'24': >-
  Dragged by a woman, shaven-headed, he was again seen clad in black garments—on
  a chariot yoked with asses, smeared and adorned with red garlands and
  unguents.
'25': >-
  Drinking oil, laughing and dancing, his mind wandering and his senses
  distraught, he went swiftly on a donkey, heading to the southern quarter.
'26': >-
  Again I saw Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, fallen on the ground with head
  downward, terrified and deluded, having fallen from the donkey.
'27': >-
  Suddenly rising up, bewildered, tormented by fear, reeling with intoxication,
  in the guise of a madman, naked to the quarters, babbling many harsh words,
'28': >-
  he quickly entered foul, unbearable, dreadful darkness like unto hell;
  plunging into a mire of filth and slime, that Rāvaṇa sank there.
'29': >-
  Setting out toward the southern quarter, the ten-necked one entered a muddy
  lake; a woman clad in red, having bound him by the throat,
'30': >-
  a dark woman with limbs smeared with mud, drags him toward Yama’s southern
  direction. Thus there I saw Kumbhakarṇa, of great strength—
'31': >-
  and all the sons of Rāvaṇa shaven-headed and anointed with oil. The ten-necked
  Rāvaṇa went with a boar, and Indrajit with a dolphin-like creature;
'32': >-
  and Kumbhakarṇa went with a camel, proceeding to the southern quarter. There I
  saw one man—Vibhīṣaṇa—beneath a white parasol,
'33': >-
  wearing white garlands and white raiment, with white fragrant unguents;
  honored with the blare of conches and kettledrums, with dances and songs,
'34': >-
  mounted upon a divine four-tusked elephant, huge as a mountain, whose sound
  was like the rumbling of thunderclouds—there Vibhīṣaṇa stood,
'35': appearing in the sky together with four ministers.
'36': >-
  A great assembly took place, resounding with songs and musical instruments—of
  rākṣasas wearing red garlands and red garments, drinking.
'37': >-
  And this fair city Laṅkā, filled with horses, chariots, and elephants, I saw
  fallen into the sea, with its gateways and arches broken.
'38': >-
  Laṅkā I saw in my dream—guarded by Rāvaṇa—burned by Rāma’s messenger, the
  mighty monkey.
'39': >-
  Having drunk oil, reckless, laughing loudly— all the rākṣasī-women in Laṅkā,
  made rough with ash,
'40': >-
  and Kumbhakarṇa and the rest—these foremost of rākṣasas, all—taking red
  clothing, entered a lake of cow-dung.
'41': >-
  “Go away; behold—Rāghava will attain to Sītā. That supremely wrathful one will
  slay you, together with the rākṣasas.”
'42': >-
  His dear and greatly cherished wife—who followed him into forest-dwelling as a
  faithful vow—whether she be reviled or threatened, Rāghava will not tolerate
  it.
'43': >-
  Therefore, enough of cruel words; let soothing words alone be spoken. Let us
  entreat the daughter of Videha—this, indeed, is pleasing to me.
'44': >-
  For she to whom such a dream appears while in sorrow—she is freed from many
  sorrows and attains unsurpassed joy.
'45': >-
  Even if she has been reviled, beseech her, O rākṣasīs—why this obstinate
  intent? For dreadful fear from Rāghava has come upon the rākṣasas.
'46': >-
  For Maithilī, Janaka’s daughter, when pleased by obeisance, is sufficient to
  protect you rākṣasīs from great fear.
'47': >-
  And moreover, in that wide-eyed lady I perceive no mark at all—no deformity
  upon her limbs, not even a most subtle evil sign.
'48': >-
  Only a slight defect of shadow do I suspect as the sorrow that has come; yet
  this divine lady, unworthy of suffering, stands as though uplifted into the
  sky.
'49': >-
  But I see the fulfillment of purpose for Vaidehī standing near at hand—and the
  destruction of the rākṣasa-lord, and the victory of Rāghava as well.
'50': >-
  This is indeed an omen; it is fitting to hear great gladness concerning her.
  And her eyes are seen to throb, long like lotus-petals.
'51': >-
  And the right side of her face is slightly delighted, though hitherto
  inauspicious; and suddenly, for Vaidehī, one arm begins to tremble.
'52': >-
  Her left thigh—matchless, like the trunk of an elephant’s foreleg—trembles, as
  though telling her that Rāghava stands before her.
'53': >-
  And a bird, having entered again and again the abode of branches, repeatedly
  speaking excellent words of comfort—uttering again and again a well-welcoming
  speech—seemed as though it kept urging her, rejoicing.
'54': >-
  Then that modest young lady, gladdened by the thought of her husband’s
  victory, said: “If that is true, then indeed I shall be a refuge for you.”
'55': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-seventh canto of Sundara-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, called “Trijaṭā’s Dream.”
