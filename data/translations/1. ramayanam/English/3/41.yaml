'0': >-
  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, is the forty-first
  canto, called “The Censure of Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Thus commanded by Rāvaṇa in a manner hostile and imperious like a king,
  (Mārīca,) fearless, spoke harsh words to the lord of the rākṣasas.
'2': >-
  By whom, O night-ranger of sinful deeds, has this counsel of thy ruin been
  given to thee—ruin together with thy sons, thy kingdom, and thy ministers?
'3': >-
  Who, O king—(thou) evil-doer—being at ease, does not rejoice at thee? By whom
  has this approach to the very gate of death been taught to thee?
'4': >-
  Thy enemies, O night-ranger, clearly—most clearly—desire thee to be destroyed,
  with thy strength diminished, hemmed in by one mightier than thyself.
'5': >-
  By whom, base and of perverted understanding, has this been instructed to
  thee—by one who desires thee to perish through thine own deeds, O
  night-ranger?
'6': >-
  Truly, Rāvaṇa, thy counsellors ought to be slain—those who, when thou hast
  mounted the path of ruin, do not restrain thee in every way.
'7': >-
  For a king who, through ministers that pander to his desires, has taken refuge
  in the wrong road, must in every manner be checked by the righteous. Yet,
  though to be restrained, thou art not restrained.
'8': >-
  Dharma, wealth, pleasure, and fame—O best of victors—ministers attain by the
  favour of their lord, O night-ranger.
'9': >-
  But when the reverse befalls, all that becomes fruitless, O Rāvaṇa; through
  the lord’s defect and fault, other men meet with calamity.
'10': >-
  For dharma and fame have the king as their very root, O best of conquerors;
  therefore, in all conditions and at all times, kings must be carefully guarded
  (from ruin and wrongdoing).
'11': >-
  A kingdom cannot be ruled, O night-ranger, by excessive harshness; nor, O
  rākṣasa, by extreme hostility; nor by one who is undisciplined and untrained.
'12': >-
  Those ministers who give harsh counsel, when employed together with such a
  ruler, quickly bring him into peril—like chariots driven fast on uneven ground
  by drivers of sluggish skill.
'13': >-
  Many upright men in the world, devoted to the practice of rightful dharma,
  have been ruined—together with all their possessions and attendants—through
  the offence of others.
'14': >-
  Under a hostile master, O Rāvaṇa, sharp and cruel, subjects that are
  “protected” do not prosper—like sheep guarded by a jackal.
'15': >-
  Surely all the rākṣasas, O Rāvaṇa, will be destroyed—those whose king thou
  art: harsh, of evil counsel, and with thy senses unsubdued.
'16': >-
  Therefore this dreadful chance—like the meeting of crow and palmyra-fruit—has
  come upon me; here thou art to be lamented, for thou shalt perish together
  with thy army.
'17': >-
  After Rāma has slain me, he will ere long slay thee. By this I am content in
  my purpose; and I shall die, even though struck down by an enemy.
'18': >-
  Know me to be already slain from the very sight of Rāma; and know thyself also
  to be slain, having carried off Sītā together with her kinsmen (and
  protectors).
'19': >-
  If thou shalt bring Sītā from the hermitage, with me as thy companion, then
  neither thou nor I shall remain—nor Laṅkā, nor the rākṣasas.
'20': >-
  Though restrained by me, who seek thy welfare, thou canst not endure this
  word, O night-ranger; for men whose life is spent, who are as good as dead,
  accept not the wholesome counsel spoken by friends.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the forty-first canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the venerable, holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Censure of Rāvaṇa.”
