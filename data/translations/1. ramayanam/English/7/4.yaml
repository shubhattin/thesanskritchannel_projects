  Now begins the Fourth Sarga in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The narration of the origin of the earlier man-eating
  rākṣasas preceding Rāvaṇa and others.”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words spoken by Agastya, Rāma was filled with wonder: “How indeed
  did the race of rākṣasas formerly come to be in Laṅkā?”
'2': >-
  Then, gently shaking his head, and beholding Agastya—whose splendour was like
  the three sacred fires—again and again, Rāma, smiling, addressed him.
'3': >-
  “O Blessed One, even previously this Laṅkā belonged to the flesh-eaters—so it
  is said. Having heard these words of yours, O venerable sage, an exceeding
  amazement has arisen in me.”
'4': >-
  “We have heard that the rākṣasas sprang from the lineage of Pulastya; but now
  you have also described their origin as arising from another source.”
'5': >-
  “Compared with Rāvaṇa, with Kumbhakarṇa, with Prahasta, and with Vikaṭa, and
  also compared with the sons of Rāvaṇa—who, pray, were those mightier than
  them?”
'6': >-
  “Who was their first ancestor, O Brahman? What was his name, and who was that
  one of terrible strength? And for what offence were they driven away—how were
  they expelled by Viṣṇu?”
'7': >-
  “Tell me all this in full detail, O sinless one. This curiosity presses upon
  me—dispel it, as the sun dispels darkness.”
'8': >-
  Hearing the words of Rāghava—auspicious and adorned by good breeding and
  refinement—Agastya, slightly amazed, spoke to Rāghava.
'9': >-
  “In ancient times Prajāpati, having created the waters that arise as the
  ocean’s expanse, produced living beings for their protection—he who is
  lotus-born.”
'10': >-
  “Those beings, bowing in humility, approached the creator of beings, saying,
  ‘What are we to do?’—afflicted by hunger, thirst, and fear.”
'11': >-
  “Then Prajāpati said to those beings, as though smiling: addressing them
  carefully in words, that bestower of honour declared, ‘Protect!’”
'12': >-
  “Thereupon some said, ‘Let us protect (rakṣāma),’ while others said, ‘Let us
  eat (jakṣāma).’ Thus spoken to by the eaten and the not-eaten, the Maker of
  beings then said to them:”
'13': >-
  “‘Those of you who said “rakṣāma”—you shall become Rākṣasas. Those of you who
  said “jakṣāma”—you shall become Yakṣas.’”
'14': >-
  “There, Heti and Praheti—two brothers, lords among the rākṣasas—appeared,
  resembling Madhu and Kaiṭabha, both foes’ subduers.”
'15': >-
  “Of the two, Praheti was righteous and at that time dwelt in a forest of
  austerities; but Heti then applied himself with supreme effort to the duties
  of household life.”
'16': >-
  “That great-minded one of immeasurable spirit took to wife a maiden named
  Bhayā, sister of Kāla (Time)—a woman dreadful and fear-inspiring.”
'17': >-
  “Upon her Heti, foremost of rākṣasas, begot a son—best among those who have
  sons—who was famed as Vidyutkeśa.”
'18': >-
  “Vidyutkeśa, the son of Heti—radiant like the blazing sun—grew, that greatly
  splendid one, like a cloud swelling in the midst of waters.”
'19': >-
  “When that night-ranger attained his auspicious youth, his father then
  resolved to perform the rite of marriage for him.”
'20': >-
  “Thereafter Heti, foremost of rākṣasas, sought for his son the daughter of
  Sandhyā—equal to Sandhyā in splendour.”
'21': >-
  “Reflecting, Sandhyā thought, ‘Surely she must be given to another,’ and so
  her daughter was bestowed upon Vidyutkeśa, O Rāghava.”
'22': >-
  “Having obtained Sandhyā’s daughter, Vidyutkeśa the night-ranger delighted
  together with her—like Maghavān (Indra) with Paulomī.”
'23': >-
  “After some time had passed, O Rāma, that lady named Sālakaṭaṅkaṭā conceived
  by Vidyutkeśa—like a mass of clouds rising from the ocean.”
'24': >-
  “Then that rākṣasī brought forth the child—resplendent like a cloud-laden
  womb—having gone to Mount Mandara, as Gaṅgā once brought forth the Fire-born
  (Agni) as her child.”
'25': >-
  “But having cast away that child, Sālakaṭaṅkaṭā—intent upon pleasure with
  Vidyutkeśa—sportingly remained with her husband, forgetting her own son.”
'26': >-
  “The child thus abandoned then resounded with a voice like the rumbling of
  clouds. That infant, forsaken by them, shone like the autumn sun; placing his
  own fist into his mouth, he then wept softly.”
'27': >-
  “Then Śiva, together with Pārvatī, mounted upon his bull, and while travelling
  by the path of the wind through the sky, heard the sound of that crying.”
'28': >-
  “Along with Umā he beheld the weeping rākṣasa child; and out of compassion,
  Bhava—the destroyer of Tripura—was moved.”
'29': >-
  “Mahādeva—imperishable and undecaying—made that rākṣasa child to be of an age
  equal to his mother’s, and also made him immortal.”
'30': >-
  “Wishing to please Pārvatī, he granted him a city moving in the sky; and Umā
  too bestowed a boon, O prince among men, upon the rākṣasas.”
'31': >-
  “Immediate was the recognition of the pregnancy, immediate indeed was the
  birth; immediate too was the attainment of age—equal to the mother’s own age.”
'32': >-
  “Then Sukeśa, proud of the boon, having obtained prosperity from Hara, the
  Lord, while standing at his side, wandered everywhere—great and
  high-souled—having gained that aerial city, like Purandara (Indra) obtaining
  his city.”
'33': >-
  Thus ends the Fourth Sarga, entitled “The narration of the origin of the
  earlier man-eating rākṣasas preceding Rāvaṇa and others,” in the Uttara Kāṇḍa
  of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
