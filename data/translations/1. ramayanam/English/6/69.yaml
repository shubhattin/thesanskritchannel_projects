'0': >-
  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the sixty-ninth
  chapter, named “The Slaying of Narāntaka.”
'1': >-
  Thus, while the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, overwhelmed by grief, was lamenting,
  Triśiras, having heard him in his sorrow, spoke these words.
'2': >-
  “Just so, O King—mighty indeed—our father’s middle son has been slain. Yet
  good men, O King, do not lament as you are doing.”
'3': >-
  “Surely, O Lord, you are sufficient even to match the three worlds; why then
  do you grieve over yourself in this manner, like a common man?”
'4': >-
  “You have the divine spear bestowed by Brahmā, and armor, arrows, and a bow;
  and there is a chariot yoked with a thousand asses, thunderous as a cloud.”
'5': >-
  “By your weapon have gods and Dānavas again and again been struck down. Being
  furnished with every kind of weapon, you should chastise Rāghava.”
'6': >-
  “Remain where you are, O great king; I shall go forth to battle. I shall pluck
  out your foes, like Garuḍa seizing serpents.”
'7': >-
  “As Śambara was laid low by the lord of the gods, and Naraka by Viṣṇu, so
  today shall Rāma be made to lie prostrate by me, felled in combat.”
'8': >-
  Hearing Triśiras’s words, Rāvaṇa, lord of the Rākṣasas, thinking himself as if
  born anew—impelled by Fate—took heart again.
'9': >-
  Hearing Triśiras’s words, Devāntaka and Narāntaka, and the radiant Atikāya as
  well, became gladdened for battle.
'10': >-
  Then, crying out “I! I!” and roaring thus, those bulls among the Rākṣasas—the
  valiant sons of Rāvaṇa, whose prowess was like Indra’s—advanced.
'11': >-
  All were moving through the mid-air; all were masters of illusion; all were
  slayers of the pride of the gods; all were fiercely intoxicated with battle.
'12': >-
  All were endowed with great strength; all had far-spread fame; and all, when
  they had reached the battlefield, were never heard of as being defeated.
'13': >-
  Even among the gods—together with Gandharvas, Kinnaras, and great
  serpents—these heroes were all knowers of missiles; all were skilled in war;
  all were possessed of excellent knowledge; and all had obtained boons as well.
'14': >-
  Surrounded by such sons, whose splendor was like the sun’s and who crushed the
  fortune and pride of the enemy host, the king shone—like Maghavan (Indra)
  surrounded by the gods, destroyers of the pride of mighty Dānavas.
'15': >-
  Embracing his sons and adorning them with ornaments, and blessing them with
  fitting benedictions, he sent them forth to battle.
'16': >-
  And Rāvaṇa also sent into the conflict the two brothers, Yuddhonmatta and
  Matta, for the protection of the princes.
'17': >-
  Having saluted that great-souled Rāvaṇa, the terror of the worlds, and having
  duly circumambulated him, those huge-bodied ones set out.
'18': >-
  Anointing themselves with all herbs and fragrant unguents, those greatly
  powerful, foremost among the Rākṣasas—these six who longed for battle—went
  forth.
'19': >-
  Triśiras and Atikāya, Devāntaka and Narāntaka, and Mahodara and Mahāpārśva
  went out, driven on by Fate.
'20': >-
  Then Mahodara mounted the noble elephant Sudarśana, resembling a dark-blue
  rain-cloud, born in the lineage of Airāvata.
'21': >-
  Equipped with every weapon and adorned with quivers, seated upon that elephant
  he shone like the sun on the brow of the sky at the time of setting.
'22': >-
  Triśiras, son of Rāvaṇa, mounted the best of chariots, joined to excellent
  steeds and filled with every kind of weapon.
'23': >-
  Triśiras, having mounted his chariot, shone as a bowman—like a cloud with
  lightning and blazing meteors, and like a rainbow along with Indra.
'24': >-
  Adorned with three crowns, Triśiras shone upon that excellent chariot, like
  Himavān, the lord of mountains, with three golden peaks.
'25': >-
  At that time, Atikāya, exceedingly radiant—the son of the lord of
  Rākṣasas—mounted the best of chariots, foremost among all bowmen.
'26': >-
  It had excellent wheels and was well fitted, with a good drawbar and fine
  yoke; it blazed with quivers, arrows, and bow, and it was crowded with spears,
  swords, and iron clubs.
'27': >-
  With a splendidly resplendent golden, variegated crown and with ornaments, he
  looked like Mount Meru, as though illumining all by his radiance.
'28': >-
  That mighty prince shone upon that chariot, surrounded by tiger-like Rākṣasas,
  like the wielder of the thunderbolt (Indra) among the immortals.
'29': >-
  Narāntaka mounted a huge, swift-going, white horse, famed like Uccaiḥśravas
  and adorned with golden trappings.
'30': >-
  Taking up a spear that shone like a flaming brand, Narāntaka blazed; and,
  bearing that radiant śakti, he looked like Guha (Kārttikeya) stationed upon
  his peacock.
'31': >-
  Devāntaka took up a mace adorned with gold, and, grasping it in his arms as
  though he were holding a mountain, he mocked the very form of Viṣṇu.
'32': >-
  Mahāpārśva, great in splendor and valor, taking up a club, shone as a
  club-bearer in battle like Kubera.
'33': >-
  Those great-souled ones set forth like the gods from Amarāvatī, attended by
  elephants, horses, and by chariots that rumbled like clouds.
'34': >-
  Those great-souled Rākṣasas, bearing excellent weapons, flew up (advanced
  impetuously); and those princely youths, radiant as the sun, shone forth.
'35': >-
  Crowned and endowed with splendor, they were like blazing planets in the sky;
  and the line of their uplifted weapons appeared bright and white.
'36': >-
  Like a row of swans in the heavens, or like autumn-clouds, they went forth,
  having resolved in their minds either the death of their enemies or their
  defeat.
'37': >-
  Having thus formed their intent, those heroes eager for battle met (came into
  action); they roared, they shouted aloud, and they hurled their missiles.
'38': >-
  And as they went forth, those great-souled ones, mad with the intoxication of
  battle, seized up their arms; by their war-cries and their clapping and
  snapping sounds, the earth seemed to quake.
'39': >-
  By the lion-roars of the Rākṣasas, the sky seemed as though split; and those
  mighty Rākṣasa chiefs, emerging in high spirits, advanced.
'40': >-
  They beheld the Vānara host, with rocks and mountains lifted up; and the
  great-souled monkeys too beheld the Rākṣasa army.
'41': >-
  It was densely packed with elephants, horses, and chariots; it rang with the
  sound of hundreds of small bells; it resembled a dark-blue rain-cloud; and it
  stood with great weapons upraised.
'42': >-
  It was encompassed on every side by Rākṣasas who were like blazing fire and
  the sun; seeing that army coming on, the monkeys, having found their mark,
  took heart.
'43': >-
  With great mountains uplifted, they roared again and again; unable to endure
  the Rākṣasas, the Vānaras counter-roared.
'44': >-
  Then, hearing that exalted tumult—the cry of the monkey troop-leaders—the
  Rākṣasa hosts, unable to bear the fierce joy of the enemy, uttered a dreadful
  and still more terrible roar.
'45': >-
  Entering that terrible Rākṣasa army, the monkey chieftains ranged about with
  their lifted mountains, like peak-crowned mountains moving within mountains.
'46': >-
  Some monkeys sprang into the sky; some stayed upon the earth; enraged against
  the Rākṣasa troops, some fought with trees and rocks as their weapons.
'47': >-
  The foremost of monkeys, seizing huge-trunked trees, fought; and that battle
  became dreadful, crowded with Rākṣasas and Vānaras.
'48': >-
  With trees, rocks, and mountain-crags they made an unequalled shower; though
  checked by torrents of arrows, those monkeys of terrible prowess pressed on.
'49': >-
  In battle, both Rākṣasas and Vānaras raised lion-roars; and with rocks the
  monkeys crushed the night-roaming demons.
'50': >-
  Enraged, they struck down in the conflict those clad in armor and
  ornaments—some among the warriors upon chariots, and some upon elephants and
  horses.
'51': >-
  Leaping suddenly, the monkeys struck down the Rākṣasas; those whose limbs were
  armed with mountain-peaks, striking with fists, rolled their eyes in fury.
'52': >-
  There the foremost of Rākṣasas reeled, fell, and cried out; and the Rākṣasas,
  with sharp arrows, pierced the elephant-like monkeys.
'53': >-
  With tridents, maces, and swords, and with spears and javelins they struck;
  seeking victory over one another, they made each other fall.
'54': >-
  There, monkeys and Rākṣasas, their bodies smeared with the blood of foes—then,
  with rocks and swords hurled by both monkeys and Rākṣasas—(the slaughter raged
  on).
'55': >-
  In but a moment the ground was covered and became drenched with blood. Strewn
  with mountain-like bodies—Rākṣasas and monkeys crushed together—the earth then
  appeared full, as the battle-maddened hosts pressed and trampled.
'56': >-
  Monkeys were seized and hurled, and their rocks were shattered; yet then,
  coming close with their very limbs, they waged a wondrous fight.
'57': >-
  Those bulls among the Rākṣasas slew monkeys with monkeys themselves; and the
  monkeys too slew Rākṣasas with Rākṣasas themselves.
'58': >-
  Hurling rocks and crags, those Rākṣasas smote; and the monkeys, cutting away
  their weapons, struck down the demons.
'59': >-
  They struck down with mountain-peaks and shattered one another; and in battle
  both Rākṣasas and Vānaras raised lion-roars.
'60': >-
  Rākṣasas, their armor and mail cut away, were slain by the monkeys; and blood
  streamed from them there, like the sap-essence flowing from trees.
'61': >-
  And in battle the monkeys struck down, some with chariot against chariot,
  elephant against elephant, and some with horse against horse.
'62': >-
  With razor-headed shafts, half-moon arrows, and sharp bhalla darts, the
  Rākṣasas split apart the trees and rocks of the lords of monkeys.
'63': >-
  With mountains scattered, and with trees cut down in the conflict, and with
  monkeys and Rākṣasas slain, the earth became hard to traverse.
'64': >-
  Those monkeys, proud and exultant in their movements, reaching the battlefield
  and casting off fear, all fought together with the Rākṣasas, fashioning many
  kinds of warfare, their courage undiminished.
'65': >-
  When that tumultuous and terrible crushing melee was underway—when the
  monkey-faces were rejoicing and the Rākṣasas were being felled—great seers and
  hosts of gods cried out aloud.
'66': >-
  Then Narāntaka, mounting a horse swift as the wind and gripping his sharpened
  śakti, plunged into the fierce monkey army like a fish into the great ocean.
'67': >-
  That hero pierced seven hundred monkeys with his blazing spear; that
  great-souled foe of Indra, alone and in a moment, struck down the army of the
  foremost of monkeys.
'68': >-
  And Vidyādharas and great Ṛṣis beheld that great-souled one, established on
  the horse’s back, ranging through the monkey host.
'69': >-
  There appeared his path—a mire of flesh and blood—covered over by fallen
  monkeys, huge as mountains.
'70': >-
  Before the foremost of monkeys could frame their resolve to display their
  valor, Narāntaka, passing beyond them, pierced these (others) as well.
'71': >-
  Uplifting his flaming spear at the head of battle, Narāntaka burned the monkey
  battalions like Fire burns forests.
'72': >-
  As long as the forest-dwellers were tearing up trees and rocks, so long did
  they, struck by the spear, fall like mountains split by the thunderbolt.
'73': >-
  Mighty Narāntaka ranged in all directions, crushing all around in the fight,
  like the wind in the season of rains.
'74': >-
  The heroes could neither run nor stand nor even stir from fear; the valiant
  one pierced them all—whether springing up, standing still, or moving.
'75': >-
  By that single spear, like Death itself and radiant as the sun, the monkey
  forces were shattered and fell upon the face of the earth.
'76': >-
  The striking-down of that spear was like the pounding of a thunderbolt; the
  monkeys could not endure it, and they raised a mighty cry.
'77': >-
  As the monkey-heroes fell, their forms shone forth—like mountains whose
  peak-summits have been split by the thunderbolt, toppling down.
'78': >-
  But those great-souled monkey chiefs who had earlier been struck down by
  Kumbhakarṇa, now restored, came and stood by Sugrīva.
'79': >-
  Watching, Sugrīva beheld the monkey host, frightened by fear of Narāntaka,
  fleeing this way and that.
'80': >-
  Seeing the army in flight, he then saw Narāntaka approaching, spear in hand,
  stationed on the back of his horse.
'81': >-
  Seeing him, the greatly radiant Sugrīva, lord of the monkeys, spoke to the
  heroic prince Aṅgada, whose prowess was like Indra’s.
'82': >-
  “Go—this Rākṣasa hero who is mounted on a horse, who is agitating the monkey
  host—quickly separate him from his life-breath.”
'83': >-
  Hearing his lord’s command, Aṅgada leapt forth at once from the battalions
  that were cloud-like, like the sun bursting out, full of valor.
'84': >-
  Aṅgada, the best among monkeys, resembling a massed mountain-range, shone—well
  armed—like a mountain streaked with minerals.
'85': >-
  Weaponless, yet greatly radiant, furnished only with nails and fangs, Vāli’s
  son advanced upon Narāntaka and spoke these words.
'86': >-
  “Stand! What will you do with these common monkeys? Hurl quickly upon my chest
  that spear whose touch is like the thunderbolt.”
'87': >-
  Hearing Aṅgada’s words, Narāntaka grew wrathful; biting his lip with his teeth
  and breathing hard like a serpent, Narāntaka—angered—went up against Aṅgada,
  Vāli’s son.
'88': >-
  He whirled that spear and then, blazing, hurled it swiftly at Aṅgada; and upon
  Vāli’s son’s chest it broke—thunderbolt-like—and fell down to the ground.
'89': >-
  Seeing that spear then shattered—like the coil of a great serpent cut by
  Suparṇa (Garuḍa)—Vāli’s son raised his palm and struck the horse upon the
  head.
'90': >-
  With feet sunk down, with his eyes bursting, his tongue protruding, huge as a
  mountain, that horse fell upon the ground—its head smashed to fragments by the
  blow of the palm.
'91': >-
  Narāntaka was overcome by fury on seeing his horse slain and fallen; raising
  his fist, of great might, he struck Vāli’s son upon the head in battle.
'92': >-
  Then Aṅgada, his head split by the fist, poured forth violently hot blood.
  Again and again he blazed with rage and also swooned; then, regaining
  consciousness, he marveled.
'93': >-
  Then the great-souled Aṅgada, gathering his fist—swift as Death and like a
  mountain-peak—struck it down upon Narāntaka’s chest.
'94': >-
  Narāntaka, his chest pierced and sunk in by that fist, vomiting flame, his
  limbs smeared with blood, fell upon the earth like a mountain shattered by the
  fall of a thunderbolt.
'95': >-
  Then in the sky there arose a mighty acclaim of the foremost of the gods and
  of the forest-dwellers, when Narāntaka, of excellent valor, was slain in
  battle by Vāli’s son.
'96': >-
  Thereupon Aṅgada—gladdening Rāma’s heart—had accomplished that feat of valor,
  most difficult to perform. And that terrible doer of deeds (Rāma) marveled;
  then again he became delighted in the battle.
'97': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-ninth chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, called “The Slaying of Narāntaka.”
