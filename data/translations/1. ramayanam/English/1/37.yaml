  Now begins the Thirty-seventh Sarga in the Bāla-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Birth of the Divine Youth (Kumāra).”
'1': >-
  Then, while that god (Śiva) was engaged in austerities, all the gods—Indra
  with them, and Agni at their head—desiring to obtain a commander of their
  hosts, approached Pitāmaha (Brahmā).
'2': >-
  Thereupon all the deities spoke to the Blessed Pitāmaha; bowing down in
  reverence, the joyous gods—Indra with them, Agni in front—addressed him.
'3': >-
  He, for whom, O Lord, the office of commander of the gods’ army was formerly
  granted by the Blessed One, has now undertaken the highest austerity and is
  performing penance together with Umā.
'4': >-
  Therefore, what is to be done next, for the welfare of the worlds, do you duly
  ordain, O knower of right order; for you indeed are our supreme refuge.
'5': >-
  Hearing the words of the gods, the grandsire of all the worlds, consoling the
  Thirty-three with sweet speech, spoke this to them:
'6': >-
  What the daughter of the mountain has said—‘there shall be no offspring for
  the wives of the gods’—that word of hers is untroubled and assuredly true; of
  this there is no doubt.
'7': >-
  And this is the celestial Gaṅgā: in her, Fire (Hutāśana) shall beget a son—the
  commander of the gods’ hosts, the subduer of foes.
'8': >-
  The eldest daughter of the lordly mountain shall honour that son; and this
  will be held in high esteem by Umā—of this there is no doubt.
'9': >-
  Hearing his words, O joy of the Raghus, the gods, their purpose fulfilled,
  bowed down; and all of them worshipped Pitāmaha.
'10': >-
  Then, O Rāma, all the gods went to the supreme Kailāsa, adorned with ores and
  minerals, and they appointed Agni for the begetting of a son.
'11': >-
  “This is a task of the gods, O Deva (Agni); undertake it. O mighty one, cast
  your splendour—your seed—into Gaṅgā, the daughter of the mountain.”
'12': >-
  Assenting to the gods, Pāvaka approached Gaṅgā and said, “Bear this embryo, O
  देवी; it is dear to the gods.”
'13': >-
  Hearing these words, she assumed a divine form; and beholding her majesty, he
  became overwhelmed and, as it were, fell away on all sides.
'14': >-
  Then Pāvaka bathed the goddess all around; and all the streams and channels of
  Gaṅgā were filled, O delight of the Raghus.
'15': >-
  Then Gaṅgā spoke to him who stood at the head of all the gods: “O Deva, I am
  not able to bear this terrible, upsurging splendour of yours.”
'16': >-
  Burned by that fire, her mind and heart greatly distressed, then the Fire of
  all the gods spoke these words to Gaṅgā:
'17': >-
  “Here, on the side of Himavat, let this embryo be placed.” Hearing Agni’s
  words, Gaṅgā set down that exceedingly radiant embryo,
'18': >-
  and the great-splendoured one released it into the streams, O sinless one.
  What issued forth from her then shone like heated Jāmbūnada-gold.
'19': >-
  That gold, of incomparable lustre, when it reached the earth, became
  (variously) gold itself, silver of unrivalled radiance, copper, and black
  iron—born from the sharpness of that heat.
'20': >-
  And from its impurities there arose tin and lead as well. Thus, having reached
  the earth, it increased into many kinds of minerals.
'21': >-
  As soon as that embryo was deposited—its place suffused with splendours—every
  forest enclosed by mountains became golden.
'22': >-
  From that time onward, O Rāghava, it became famed as Jātarūpa (“born-gold”).
  And that gold, O tiger among men, with the very brilliance of Hutāśana—grass,
  trees, creepers, and shrubs: all became golden.
'23': >-
  Thereafter, when that Youth was born, Indra along with the hosts of Maruts,
  for the purpose of nurturing him with milk, appointed the Kṛttikās (the
  Pleiades).
'24': >-
  They, making an excellent compact regarding the newborn’s milk, gave it to
  him—resolved, “This child is the son of us all.”
'25': >-
  Then all the gods proclaimed, “He is Kārtikeya”; and, without doubt, the son
  shall become renowned throughout the three worlds.
'26': >-
  Hearing their words, at the outflow where the embryo had slipped down, they
  bathed him with supreme auspicious splendour, as he blazed like fire itself.
'27': >-
  The gods said, “He is Skanda,” because the embryo had flowed and slipped down;
  thus they called the mighty-armed Kārtikeya, O scion of Kakutstha, who was
  like flaming fire.
'28': >-
  Then the peerless milk of the Kṛttikās manifested. Becoming six-faced for the
  six (mothers), he took their breast-milk.
'29': >-
  Having taken that milk in but a single day, then, though his body was tender
  and youthful, that mighty lord conquered, by his own valour, the multitudes of
  the Daityas’ armies.
'30': >-
  Thereafter the immortals—Agni at their head—came together and consecrated that
  great-resplendent one as the commander and leader of the hosts of the gods.
'31': >-
  Thus, O Rāma, have I told you the full account of Gaṅgā’s expansion (and
  descent), and also of the blessed and meritorious birth of the Youth (Kumāra).
'32': >-
  And any man on earth who is devoted to Kārtikeya, O Kakutstha, blessed with
  long life and with sons and grandsons, shall attain the same world as Skanda.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the Thirty-seventh Sarga in the Bāla-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Birth of the Divine Youth (Kumāra).”
