  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the twenty-eighth
  chapter, called “The Account of the Valour of Mainda and Others.”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of Sāraṇa, Śuka then spoke to Rāvaṇa, lord of the Rākṣasas,
  after giving instructions regarding all that host.
'2': >-
  “Do you see those who stand there—like great elephants in rut, like banyan
  trees by the Gaṅgā, like sāla trees of the Himālaya?”
'3': >-
  “These, O king, are hard to withstand—mighty, able to assume forms at will,
  resembling Daityas and Dānavas, and in battle possessing the very prowess of
  the gods.”
'4': >-
  “Their numbers are in thousands of crores—nine, five, and seven; likewise in
  thousands of ‘śaṅkus’, and likewise in hundreds of ‘vṛndas’.”
'5': >-
  “These are Sugrīva’s counsellors, ever dwelling in Kiṣkindhā—Vānaras born from
  gods and Gandharvas, able to assume forms at will.”
'6': >-
  “Those two you see standing there—youths of divine appearance—are Mainda and
  Dvivida; in battle there is none equal to those two.”
'7': >-
  “Both were permitted by Brahmā, and both have drunk of nectar; they expect to
  crush Laṅkā by their own might.”
'8': >-
  “And that Vānara whom you see standing there, like an elephant with temples
  burst in fury—when enraged, he could by force agitate even the ocean.”
'9': >-
  “This is the one who entered Laṅkā, and also your lordship’s city, for the
  sake of Vaidehī. Behold him—he who was once seen before, that Vānara has come
  again.”
'10': >-
  “He is heard to be the elder son of Keśarī, and the son of the Wind-god; he is
  famed as Hanūmān—he by whom the ocean was leapt across.”
'11': >-
  “The foremost of Vānaras, able to take any form, endowed with strength and
  stature, of irresistible movement—like the lord of creatures who ever moves
  unimpeded.”
'12': >-
  “Seeing the rising Sun, he, when only a child and hungry, descended upon a
  path of three thousand yojanas.”
'13': >-
  “‘I shall seize the Sun; my hunger will not torment me,’—having thus resolved
  in his mind, he sprang up, puffed up with strength.”
'14': >-
  “Not to be assailed even by gods, by divine seers, or by Rākṣasas—yet, without
  reaching him, he fell near sunrise upon a mountain.”
'15': >-
  “Of that fallen monkey, one jaw was slightly broken on a slab of rock;
  therefore he is indeed Hanūmān—‘he of mighty jaw’.”
'16': >-
  “Truly, by report and tradition this Vānara is known to me; his strength, his
  form, and his majesty cannot be adequately described in words.”
'17': >-
  “He alone hopes to crush Laṅkā by his prowess—he because of whom that blazing
  comet now burns for you; and though he was also set within Laṅkā, how do you
  forget that monkey?”
'18': >-
  “And next to him is that hero—dark-hued, lotus-eyed—an exceedingly great
  chariot-warrior of the Ikṣvāku line, whose manliness is famed in the world.”
'19': >-
  “In him Dharma never wavers; he does not transgress Dharma. He knows the
  Brahmā-weapon, and the Vedas; he is the best among knowers of the Veda.”
'20': >-
  “He could pierce the sky with his arrows, and cleave even the earth; his wrath
  is like Death itself, and his valour like that of Śakra (Indra).”
'21': >-
  “He whose wife Sītā was carried off by you from Jana-sthāna—that very Rāma, O
  king, advances to fight you.”
'22': >-
  “And on his right side stands one whose splendour is like pure gold from
  Jāmbūnada—broad-chested, copper-eyed, with dark, curling locks.”
'23': >-
  “He is named Lakṣmaṇa, devoted to what is dear and beneficial to his brother;
  skilled in counsel and in war, the foremost among all bearers of weapons.”
'24': >-
  “Unforbearing, unconquerable, a vanquisher—valiant, victorious, and
  strong—Rāma’s right arm, as it were, his very life that moves outside him.”
'25': >-
  “For Rāghava’s sake he does not preserve even his own life; he longs, in
  battle, to slay all the Rākṣasas.”
'26': >-
  “But he who stands on Rāma’s left side, having taken refuge with him—encircled
  by troops of Rākṣasas—this is King Vibhīṣaṇa.”
'27': >-
  “He has been consecrated in Laṅkā by the illustrious king of kings; and now,
  enraged against you, he advances here for battle.”
'28': >-
  “And him whom you see standing in the midst, like a mountain immovable—him,
  the lord of all the monkey-chiefs, of immeasurable energy—”
'29': >-
  “—who by splendour, by fame, by intelligence, by strength, and by noble birth,
  outshines the Vānaras like the Himālaya mountain.”
'30': >-
  “He who dwells in Kiṣkindhā, in a cave amid dense trees—hard to approach, a
  mountain-fastness—together with his chief commanders and leaders of troops.”
'31': >-
  “On him shines this golden garland of a hundred lotuses, beloved of gods and
  men, in which Lakṣmī herself has her abode.”
'32': >-
  “This garland, and Tārā, and the everlasting kingdom of the monkeys—Sugrīva
  obtained after Vāli was slain, and was established (in it) by Rāma.”
'33': >-
  “The wise declare that a hundred times a hundred thousand is a koṭi; a hundred
  koṭi-thousands is called a śaṅku.”
'34': >-
  “A hundred thousand śaṅkus is remembered as a mahā-śaṅku; and a hundred
  thousand mahā-śaṅkus is here called a vṛnda.”
'35': >-
  “A hundred thousand vṛndas is remembered as a mahā-vṛnda; and a hundred
  thousand mahā-vṛndas is here called a padma.”
'36': >-
  “A hundred thousand padmas is remembered as a mahā-padma; and a hundred
  thousand mahā-padmas is here called a kharva.”
'37': >-
  “A hundred thousand kharvas is remembered as a mahā-kharva; a hundred thousand
  mahā-kharvas is called a samudra; and a hundred thousand samudras is called an
  ogha.”
'38': >-
  “A hundred thousand oghas is renowned as a mahaugha. Thus, by koṭi-thousands,
  and by hundreds of śaṅkus, and by thousands of mahā-śaṅkus, and likewise by
  hundreds of vṛndas—”
'39': >-
  “—by thousands of mahā-vṛndas, and likewise by hundreds of padmas; by
  thousands of mahā-padmas, and likewise by hundreds of kharvas—”
'40': >-
  “—and by that very measure of samudra and likewise of mahaugha—this army is of
  the extent of koṭi-mahaughas, vast like the ocean.”
'41': >-
  “Sugrīva, lord of the Vānaras—surrounded by the heroic Vibhīṣaṇa and by his
  ministers—advances after you for the sake of battle, ever encompassed by
  mighty strength and of mighty prowess.”
'42': >-
  “Therefore, O great king, having beheld this host that has arrived—like a
  blazing planet—let the utmost effort now be made, so that there may be
  victory, and not defeat at the hands of the enemy.”
'43': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-eighth chapter, named “The Account of the Valour of
  Mainda and Others,” in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primordial epic.
