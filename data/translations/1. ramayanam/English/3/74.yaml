  Now begins the seventy-fourth canto in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Śabarī’s Attainment of Heaven.”
'1': >-
  Those two sons of the best of men, having taken the western direction, set
  forth upon that path in the forest which had been shown to them toward Pampā
  by Kabandha.
'2': >-
  Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa went on, gazing upon many mountains and upon trees laden
  with honeyed blossoms and fruits, as they proceeded to behold Sugrīva.
'3': >-
  Having made their dwelling upon the back of a mountain, those delight of the
  Raghus then approached the western bank of the lake Pampā.
'4': >-
  Having reached the western shore of the lotus-lake Pampā, they then beheld
  there the beautiful hermitage of Śabarī.
'5': >-
  Approaching that hermitage, encompassed by many trees, and looking upon its
  exceeding loveliness, they drew near to Śabarī.
'6': >-
  Seeing them then, that accomplished ascetic woman rose, and with joined palms
  seized the feet of Rāma and also of the wise Lakṣmaṇa.
'7': >-
  She offered foot-water and water for sipping, all according to proper rule;
  then Rāma addressed that female renunciant who stood established in dharma.
'8': >-
  “Have your obstacles been overcome? Does your austerity increase? Is your
  anger restrained, O treasure of tapas, and is your food regulated?”
'9': >-
  “Have your observances been attained? Is there peace of mind for you? O
  sweet-speaking lady, has your service to your spiritual preceptors borne
  fruit?”
'10': >-
  Questioned by Rāma, that perfected one—approved by the perfected—Śabarī, the
  aged woman, standing before Rāma, made her report.
'11': >-
  “Today, through beholding you, the fruition of my austerities has been
  attained by me; today my birth has borne fruit, and my gurus too have been
  well worshipped.”
'12': >-
  “Today my tapas has been fruitfully performed, and heaven indeed will be
  mine—since you, O Rāma, best among divine beings, bull among men, have been
  worshipped.”
'13': >-
  “By your gracious sight, O gentle one, I have been purified, O gentle lord,
  giver of honor. By your favor, O subduer of foes, I shall go to worlds
  imperishable.”
'14': >-
  “When you arrived at Citrakūṭa, with aerial chariots of incomparable splendor,
  from here to heaven I ascended—those regions in which I formerly moved about.”
'15': >-
  “And I was told by those righteous, most fortunate great seers: ‘Rāma will
  come to you, to this most holy hermitage.’”
'16': >-
  “‘He, accompanied by Saumitrī (Lakṣmaṇa), is to be received by you as an
  honored guest; and upon seeing him, you shall go to the excellent,
  imperishable worlds.’”
'17': >-
  “Thus addressed by those most fortunate ones, O best among men, I have, for
  your sake, O best among men, gathered forest-produce of many kinds,”
'18': >-
  “O tiger among men—produce found upon the bank of Pampā for your purpose.”
  Thus spoken, that righteous-souled Rāghava said this to Śabarī:
'19': >-
  Rāghava said to her, who possessed knowledge and was ever kept free from
  neglect: “Truly, from Danu’s son (Kabandha) I have heard of the greatness and
  potency of those high-souled sages.”
'20': >-
  “I have heard it; now I desire to see it directly, if you think it proper.”
  Hearing these words that had issued from Rāma’s mouth,
'21': >-
  Śabarī showed them both that vast forest: “Behold—like a dense mass of clouds,
  and filled with deer and birds.”
'22': >-
  “It is renowned, O delight of the Raghus, as ‘Matanga’s forest.’ Here, O
  greatly glorious one, are my gurus—men of ripened spirit—who, revered with
  mantras, performed their fire-offerings with due rites, like unto the sacred
  worship prescribed by mantra.”
'23': >-
  “This is the altar-platform, and this the vedi, facing west, where those
  revered ones of mine, duly honored, offered floral oblations, their hands
  trembling from the fatigue (of long austerities).”
'24': >-
  “By the power of their austerities, behold even today, O best of the Raghus,
  the vedi shining with a splendor beyond compare, illumining all the directions
  with its radiance.”
'25': >-
  “Unable to go forth—wearied and made languid by fasting—behold the seven seas,
  assembled here, come merely by their thought (and will).”
'26': >-
  “The bark-garments, placed here upon the trees by them after their ablutions,
  even today do not dry up in this region, O delight of the Raghus.”
'27': >-
  “And these works done by them while performing divine rites—together with
  flowers and blue lotuses—do not wither away at all.”
'28': >-
  “This entire forest has been seen, and what was to be heard has been heard by
  you. Therefore, having obtained permission, I desire to abandon this body.”
'29': >-
  “I wish to go into the presence of those self-perfected sages, whose hermitage
  it is, and of whom I have been an attendant.”
'30': >-
  Hearing her words, so consonant with dharma, Rāghava along with Lakṣmaṇa
  obtained immeasurable delight, and said, “It is a wonder indeed.”
'31': >-
  Then Rāma spoke to Śabarī, she who had undertaken firm vows: “I have been
  honored by you, O auspicious lady; go, as you desire, in perfect ease.”
'32': >-
  Thus addressed—the matted-haired ascetic woman, clad in bark-garments and a
  black antelope-skin—having been granted leave by Rāma, offered herself into
  the sacred fire.
'33': >-
  Resplendent like blazing fire, she indeed went to heaven—adorned with divine
  ornaments, and with heavenly garlands and unguents.
'34': >-
  Wearing celestial raiment there, she became lovely to behold, illumining that
  region like a streak of lightning.
'35': >-
  To that holy abode where those great seers of meritorious selves sport, Śabarī
  went, through self-collected trance of the soul (samādhi).
'36': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-fourth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, entitled “Śabarī’s Attainment of Heaven.”
