  Now begins the Ninth Sarga, named “The Crowded Inner Apartments,” in the
  Sundara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. [5.9]
'1': >-
  In the midst of that most excellent of palaces, Hanumān—the son of the
  Wind-god—beheld a spotless and spacious mansion, the foremost among edifices.
  [5.9.1]
'2': >-
  It was half a yojana in breadth and a full yojana in great length—the dwelling
  of the lord of the rākṣasas—crowded with many lofty mansions and terraces.
  [5.9.2]
'3': >-
  Seeking Vaidehī, Sītā of large eyes, Hanumān—the crusher of foes—moved all
  about, searching on every side. [5.9.3]
'4': >-
  Gazing upon that supreme abode of the rākṣasas, the fortunate Hanumān reached
  the residence of the rākṣasa-king. [5.9.4]
'5': >-
  It was surrounded by elephants with four tusks, and likewise by elephants with
  three tusks; it was unconfined and unobstructed, and it was guarded by men
  bearing upraised weapons. [5.9.5]
'6': >-
  It was encircled by Rāvaṇa’s rākṣasī wives, and also by princesses brought
  there by force after displaying his might. [5.9.6]
'7': >-
  That palace, filled with crocodiles and makaras, thronged with timiṅgilas and
  great fishes, and shaken by the speed of the wind, seemed like the ocean
  crowded with serpents. [5.9.7]
'8': >-
  The very prosperity that belongs to Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera), and the splendor that
  belongs to Indra, the rider of the elephant Airāvata—those same, delightful
  and never departing, dwelt ever in Rāvaṇa’s house. [5.9.8]
'9': >-
  Such prosperity as belongs to King Kubera, to Yama, and to Varuṇa—or even a
  prosperity surpassing theirs—was present here in the houses of the rākṣasas.
  [5.9.9]
'10': >-
  In the midst of that palace, the son of the Wind-god beheld yet another
  well-built chamber, furnished with many projecting balconies and lofty
  outworks. [5.9.10]
'11': >-
  There was the divine aerial car called Puṣpaka, adorned with every
  jewel—fashioned by Viśvakarmā in heaven for Brahmā’s sake. [5.9.11]
'12': >-
  Kubera had obtained it from the Grandsire (Brahmā) by austere penance; but the
  lord of the rākṣasas, having overcome Kubera by his might, seized it for
  himself. [5.9.12]
'13': >-
  It was filled with golden deer of wondrous workmanship, and set with
  excellently fashioned pillars of refined gold, blazing as though with its own
  splendor and fortune. [5.9.13]
'14': >-
  Everywhere it was adorned with auspicious towers and fair chambers, whose
  summits were like Meru and Mandara, as though they were scraping the sky.
  [5.9.14]
'15': >-
  Crafted by Viśvakarmā, shining like fire and the sun, it had stairways of gold
  and charming, excellent platforms. [5.9.15]
'16': >-
  It was fitted with latticed windows of gold and also of crystal, and with
  choice platforms inlaid with sapphire and deep-blue gems. [5.9.16]
'17': >-
  It shone with varied coral, with exceedingly precious jewels, and with
  incomparable pearls, spread over its surface in radiant array. [5.9.17]
'18': >-
  It was furnished with red sandalwood and with gold-like brilliance, endowed
  with supremely sacred fragrance, resembling the young-rising sun. [5.9.18]
'19': >-
  Adorned with many splendid towers of diverse forms, the great monkey climbed
  up into that divine Puṣpaka. Standing there, he perceived, on every side, the
  fragrance that arose from drinks, delicacies, and foods. [5.9.19]
'20': >-
  Inhaling that heavenly, perfectly blended perfume—like a living, beautiful
  breeze—that fragrance served that great-souled one as a most excellent kinsman
  welcoming a kinsman. [5.9.20]
'21': >-
  It seemed to say, “Come this way,” toward where Rāvaṇa was. Then, proceeding
  thither, he beheld a vast and auspicious hall. [5.9.21]
'22': >-
  It was exceedingly lovely—like a beloved, noble woman of surpassing beauty—its
  stairways fashioned of gems and shining with golden latticework. [5.9.22]
'23': >-
  Its floors were overlaid with crystal, variegated with ivory inlays; it was
  further embellished with pearls, diamonds, corals, and with silver and gold as
  well. [5.9.23]
'24': >-
  It was adorned with jewel-pillars—many, many pillars—uniform, straight, and
  very tall, beautifully ornamented on every side. [5.9.24]
'25': >-
  With those lofty pillars like wings, it seemed as if it were soaring up to
  heaven; it was spread with a great carpet marked with designs of the earth.
  [5.9.25]
'26': >-
  It was expansive like the earth itself, complete with images of realms,
  houses, and halls; it resounded with intoxicated birds and was perfumed with
  divine scents. [5.9.26]
'27': >-
  It was furnished with very costly coverings, frequented by the lord of the
  rākṣasas; and, by the gray incense of aguru-wood, it looked pure and
  swan-white. [5.9.27]
'28': >-
  With offerings of leaves and flowers it shone, like a bright altar of worship;
  it gladdened the mind and also enhanced the beauty of one’s complexion.
  [5.9.28]
'29': >-
  It was divine, dispelling sorrow, like the very mother of prosperity; and with
  the five senses it offered their five excellent objects of enjoyment. [5.9.29]
'30': >-
  As though a mother, it then satisfied the senses—being protected and
  maintained by Rāvaṇa. “This is heaven; this is the world of the gods; it could
  be even Indra’s city! This indeed must be the highest success,” thus did
  Māruti think. [5.9.30]
'31': >-
  As he reflected, he saw there golden lamps, like gamblers cheated and defeated
  in play by greater cheats. [5.9.31]
'32': >-
  By the radiance of the lamps, by Rāvaṇa’s own splendor, and by the flames from
  ornaments, it seemed to blaze all around—so he thought. [5.9.32]
'33': >-
  Then he saw, lying upon rugs, a thousand noble women, adorned with garlands
  and garments of many colors and embellished with diverse ornaments and attire.
  [5.9.33]
'34': >-
  When midnight had passed, overcome by wine and sleep, having ceased their
  revelry of the night, they lay then in deep slumber. [5.9.34]
'35': >-
  That silent, slumbering company appeared splendid with its quiet
  ornaments—like a great lotus-grove where swans and bees are hushed. [5.9.35]
'36': >-
  Māruti saw the fair women’s lotus-scented faces, with teeth hidden and eyes
  closed. [5.9.36]
'37': >-
  As if they were lotuses awakened at dawn, yet with night’s end they became
  again like lotuses whose petals close at night. [5.9.37]
'38': >-
  Surely intoxicated bees repeatedly seek these lotus-faces, as they do fully
  blossomed water-born lotuses. [5.9.38]
'39': >-
  Thus did the illustrious great monkey think, by this apt comparison; for in
  their qualities he judged those faces to be like lotuses born of water.
  [5.9.39]
'40': >-
  That hall shone, made radiant by those women—like the serene autumn sky
  beautified with stars. [5.9.40]
'41': >-
  And the lord of the rākṣasas, surrounded by them, shone forth—just as the
  splendid lord of the stars (the moon) is encompassed by the stars. [5.9.41]
'42': >-
  “The stars that have fallen from the sky, still clothed with the remainder of
  their merit—here they all are gathered together,” thus thought the monkey
  then. [5.9.42]
'43': >-
  Like stars, clearly manifest, those great women of auspicious radiance shone
  there, with brilliance, color, and graceful beauty. [5.9.43]
'44': >-
  Their hair was loosened and their garlands displaced; their splendid ornaments
  lay scattered—while, at the time of drinking and sport, their minds had been
  struck down by sleep. [5.9.44]
'45': >-
  Some had their tilaka marks smeared; some had their anklets slipped out of
  place; and for some of those noble women, necklaces had fallen to the side.
  [5.9.45]
'46': >-
  Others were wreathed in pearl-necklaces; some had garments that had slipped
  down; their girdles and waist-strings were twisted, like young maidens after
  being playfully tossed about. [5.9.46]
'47': >-
  Some wore no earrings; their garlands were torn and crushed—like blooming
  creepers in a great forest trampled by a lordly elephant. [5.9.47]
'48': >-
  From some, necklaces gleamed like moonbeams; lying upon the women’s breasts in
  sleep, they looked like swans. [5.9.48]
'49': >-
  On others, cat’s-eye gems appeared like kādamba birds; and on still others,
  golden strings were like cakravāka birds. [5.9.49]
'50': >-
  With swans and kāraṇḍavas and adorned with cakravākas, those women shone like
  rivers, their hips like sandy banks. [5.9.50]
'51': >-
  Like rivers asleep, they appeared—broad with golden lotuses and resembling
  nets of tiny bells—capturing the heart, with fame as their banks. [5.9.51]
'52': >-
  Upon the soft limbs of some, and upon the tips of some women’s breasts, fair
  rows of ornaments rested like ornaments indeed. [5.9.52]
'53': >-
  For some, fine garments, stirred by the breath from their faces, fluttered
  again and again above their countenances. [5.9.53]
'54': >-
  Like banners lifted and waving, those lovely, many-colored golden fabrics
  shone at the roots of their faces. [5.9.54]
'55': >-
  And here the earrings of some women, of auspicious luster, gently
  trembled—shaken softly by the breath from their mouths. [5.9.55]
'56': >-
  Fragrant with sugar and fermented liquor, naturally sweet-smelling and
  pleasing, the breath from their faces then served Rāvaṇa like a delightful
  breeze. [5.9.56]
'57': >-
  Some of Rāvaṇa’s women, whose faces resembled Rāvaṇa’s own, repeatedly sniffed
  the faces of their co-wives. [5.9.57]
'58': >-
  Those excellent women, their minds exceedingly attached to Rāvaṇa, lacking
  independence, then acted only in ways pleasing to their co-wives as well.
  [5.9.58]
'59': >-
  Placing their arms—adorned with fitting ornaments—beneath them, and their
  lovely garments, the women lay there resting. [5.9.59]
'60': >-
  One lay with her chest upon another; another again had her arm upon that one;
  another lay in another’s lap; and yet another upon that one’s breasts.
  [5.9.60]
'61': >-
  Resting upon one another’s thighs, sides, hips, and backs, their limbs
  entwined, they followed the sway of intoxication and affection. [5.9.61]
'62': >-
  Delighted by the contact of one another’s bodies, those slender-waisted women,
  with arms all interlinked, slept there. [5.9.62]
'63': >-
  That garland of women, strung together by one another’s arms as though by a
  thread, shone like a garland on a string, filled with intoxicated bees.
  [5.9.63]
'64': >-
  Like flowering creepers in the month of Mādhava (spring), which by the touch
  of the breeze become intertwined garland-like, their clusters of blossoms
  clinging together—so was it. [5.9.64]
'65': >-
  With lovely shoulders clasped about, and swarming with bees that moved among
  them, that women’s grove of Rāvaṇa seemed like a forest shaken by the wind.
  [5.9.65]
'66': >-
  Even though their ornaments, limbs, garments, and garlands were all suitable
  and splendid, at that time it was not possible to distinguish clearly among
  those women. [5.9.66]
'67': >-
  While Rāvaṇa lay at ease in happiness, those women of varied splendor—and the
  blazing golden lamps—appeared like eyes gazing without blinking. [5.9.67]
'68': >-
  Women of royal seers, of brahmins, of daityas, and of gandharvas—and also
  maidens of rākṣasas—had come there, all fallen under the power of his desire.
  [5.9.68]
'69': >-
  All those women were carried off by Rāvaṇa, eager for battle, by force of war;
  and some, intoxicated with passion, deluded by love, came of their own accord.
  [5.9.69]
'70': >-
  There were no women there who had been obtained by violence through mere
  strength, nor any who desired another man, nor any belonging to another
  before—save only Janaka’s daughter, that lady worthy of a noble husband.
  [5.9.70]
'71': >-
  None became his wife who was of low family, or lacking in beauty, or
  inauspicious, or devoid of proper conduct; nor did any lack good character;
  nor was any, for a lover, undesirable. [5.9.71]
'72': >-
  Then this thought arose in the lord of monkeys: “If Rāghava’s lawful wife is
  of such a kind, then surely these wives of the great rākṣasa-king must indeed
  be well-born,”—such was the reasoning of that righteous-minded one. [5.9.72]
'73': >-
  Again, the mighty one who had assumed a form at will reflected: “Sītā is
  certainly superior in virtue and qualities. And this lord of Laṅkā, though
  powerful, has committed a grievous hardship against her—an ignoble deed.”
  [5.9.73]
'74': >-
  Thus ends the Ninth Sarga, named “The Crowded Inner Apartments,” in the
  Sundara Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya. [5.9]
