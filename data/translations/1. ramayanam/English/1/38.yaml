  Now begins the thirty-eighth canto, named “The Birth of the Sons of Sagara,”
  in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Having thus related that tale to Rāma in sweet and well-formed words,
  Viśvāmitra once again spoke to the scion of Kakutstha these further words:
'2': >-
  Formerly there was a valiant lord of Ayodhyā, a ruler among men, named
  Sagara—righteous-souled and desirous of progeny, yet without offspring.
'3': >-
  O Rāma, the daughter of the king of Vidarbha, named Keśinī by name, was
  Sagara’s elder queen—steadfast in dharma and a speaker of truth.
'4': >-
  And Aruṇa’s sister (Suparṇā’s sister), the daughter of Ariṣṭanemi, was
  Sagara’s second consort, known by the name Sumati.
'5': >-
  Together with those two queens, that great king performed austere tapas; and
  having reached the Himālaya, on the mountain at Bhṛgu’s sacred spring, he
  undertook his penance.
'6': >-
  Then, when a full hundred years had passed, the sage—won over by that
  austerity—Bhṛgu, foremost among the truthful, granted Sagara a boon.
'7': >-
  “A very great gain of offspring shall be yours, O sinless one; and you shall
  attain incomparable renown in the world, O bull among men.
'8': >-
  One (queen), dear son, shall bear you a single son who will continue your
  lineage; the other shall bring forth sixty thousand sons.”
'9': >-
  Hearing the words of that great-souled sage and pleasing him, those two
  princess-queens, filled with supreme joy, spoke then with palms joined in
  reverence:
'10': >-
  “O Brahman, whose shall be the one son, and who shall bear the many? We desire
  to hear this, O Brahman. Let your word indeed prove true.”
'11': >-
  On hearing their request, Bhṛgu, supremely righteous, spoke these excellent
  words: “Let it be arranged here according to your own choice.
'12': >-
  Let there be either a single heir who will uphold the dynasty, or else many
  sons of great might—renowned and of mighty enterprise. Which of you desires
  which boon?”
'13': >-
  Hearing the sage’s words, O Rāghava, Keśinī chose, in the presence of the
  king, the boon of a single son who would perpetuate the royal line.
'14': >-
  And Sumati, the sister of Suparṇā, chose then sixty thousand
  sons—high-spirited, famed, and full of great endeavor.
'15': >-
  Having circumambulated the sage and bowed to him with her head, the king,
  together with his queens, returned to his own city, O delighter of the Raghus.
'16': >-
  Thereafter, when time had passed, the elder queen gave birth to a son—Sagara’s
  child—who became renowned by the name Asaṃmañja.
'17': >-
  But Sumati, O tiger among men, brought forth a gourd-like womb; and from the
  splitting of that gourd issued forth sixty thousand sons.
'18': >-
  Nurses reared them in jars filled with clarified butter; and after a long
  lapse of time, all of them attained youth.
'19': >-
  Then, after a long time, those sixty thousand sons of Sagara—endowed with
  beauty and the bloom of youth—came to be.
'20': >-
  But Sagara’s eldest son, that best of men, born of his own body, would seize
  little children and, O Raghunandana, take them to the waters of the Sarayū,
'21': >-
  and cast them in, laughing continually as he watched them sink. Thus were his
  deeds sinful, obstructing and harming the good.
'22': >-
  Engaged in what was injurious to the citizens, he was banished from the city
  by his father. His son was named Aṃśumān—valiant, the child of Asaṃmañja.
'23': >-
  Approved by all people and pleasing of speech to everyone, he became beloved;
  and in course of much time, a resolve arose (in Sagara’s mind).
'24': >-
  O best of men, Sagara’s settled determination was: “I should perform a
  sacrifice.” Having thus decided, the king—together with his household priests
  and experts in the Vedas—then began the sacrificial rite and set about
  undertaking the yajña.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-eighth canto, called “The Birth of the Sons of Sagara,”
  in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic.
