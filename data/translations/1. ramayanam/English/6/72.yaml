  Now, in the holy, glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins
  the seventy-second canto, named “The Manifestation of Rāvaṇa’s Wrath and
  Grief.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that Atikāya had been slain by the high-souled Lakṣmaṇa, the king
  (Rāvaṇa) was seized with agitation, and spoke these words:
'2': >-
  “Dhūmrākṣa—exceeding wrathful, the foremost among all who bear weapons; and
  Akampana, and Prahasta, and likewise Kumbhakarṇa—
'3': >-
  these heroic rākṣasas, mighty in strength and longing for battle, were
  conquerors of hostile armies, and ever unconquered by their foes.
'4': >-
  Yet those heroes, together with their armies, have been slain by Rāma, whose
  deeds know no weariness—those rākṣasas of colossal bodies, skilled in many
  kinds of weapons.
'5': >-
  And many other valiant, great-souled warriors have also been struck down—by my
  son Indrajit, famed for strength and prowess.
'6': >-
  “Then those two brothers (Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa) were bound by dreadful arrows,
  endowed with boons—something which could not be accomplished by all the gods
  together, nor even by the mighty asuras—
'7': >-
  nor could that terrible bondage be released by yakṣas, gandharvas, or
  serpents. By what power, or by what illusion, or by what deluding magic, I do
  not know—
'8': >-
  those two brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, were freed from the bondage of arrows.
  And the warriors—those brave rākṣasas—who went forth by my command, have—
'9': >-
  all of them been slain in battle by the exceedingly mighty vānaras. Today I do
  not see, in battle, anyone who might destroy that hero Rāma with Lakṣmaṇa,
  along with his forces—
'10': >-
  together with Sugrīva and Vibhīṣaṇa. Alas, mighty indeed is Rāma, and great is
  the power of his celestial weapons.
'11': >-
  “Meeting with whose valor the rākṣasas have gone to death, that heroic Rāghava
  I deem to be Nārāyaṇa himself, the flawless and free from all affliction.
'12': >-
  Therefore, out of fear of him, the city of Laṅkā must have its gates and
  archways shut fast; and everywhere, with unremitting vigilance, this city must
  be guarded in detachments.
'13': >-
  And Ashoka-vatikā also—where Sītā is kept under guard—whether there be an exit
  or an entry there, it must be known to us at all times.
'14': >-
  Wherever a detachment may be stationed, there—again and again—stand on every
  side, each group surrounded by its own forces.
'15': >-
  And the movements of those vānaras must be watched, O night-rangers—at evening
  twilight, at midnight, and at dawn as well—on every side.
'16': >-
  Never at any time should contempt be shown toward the vānaras; for the force
  of enemies, when marshalled and advancing, whether one is standing still or
  otherwise, comes crashing down.
'17': >-
  Then all those rākṣasas, hearing the command of the lord of Laṅkā, complied
  with all his words exactly, being men of great strength.
'18': >-
  Having thus instructed them all, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, wretched and
  bearing within him the sharp pang of wrath and grief, entered his own palace.
'19': >-
  Thereupon that mighty lord of the night-rangers, with the fire of wrath
  blazing within him, brooding on that very calamity concerning his son, again
  and again heaved deep sighs.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-second canto, named “The Manifestation of Rāvaṇa’s Wrath
  and Grief,” in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval
  epic.
