  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-first chapter, named “Hanumān’s Consolation.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon Hanumān, the leader of the troop of vānaras, gently consoled Tārā,
  who had fallen down—cast down like a star that has slipped from the sky.
'2': >-
  A living being reaps the fruit of his own deeds—good or evil—born of his
  merits and faults. When he is free from agitation, he attains all that result
  after death as well: auspicious and inauspicious.
'3': >-
  Whom do you grieve for, you who grieve—who indeed is to be grieved for? Whom
  do you, yourself afflicted, compassionately lament as afflicted? In this body,
  which is like a bubble, who belongs to whom, and who is there that should be
  mourned for?
'4': >-
  This young prince Aṅgada is to be looked upon by you as your living son. And,
  considering what is to be done in the future, reflect upon those courses of
  action that are within his power.
'5': >-
  You know thus the ungoverned coming and going—the arrival and departure—of
  beings. Therefore, indeed, what is auspicious is to be done; in this world, a
  wise person does not act merely by worldly impulse.
'6': >-
  He in whom thousands of vānaras—hundreds and even tens of thousands—abiding in
  firm hope, carry on their lives, has now reached the end appointed by destiny.
'7': >-
  Since he—whose vision was fixed on what is right, who was skilled in
  conciliation and gifts, and who was beyond forbearance (in prowess)—has gone
  to the land won by dharma, you ought not to mourn for him.
'8': >-
  And all these tiger-like vānaras, and this son of yours, Aṅgada, and the
  kingship of the lord of vānaras and bears—O blameless lady—are all not without
  your support.
'9': >-
  Therefore, O passionate lady, gently rouse these two who are scorched by
  grief. With you as guardian, let this Aṅgada rule the earth.
'10': >-
  As the succession has been seen (to continue), and as the duty that now stands
  before you—let all that be done for the king; this is the sure determination
  of time.
'11': >-
  Let the rites be performed for the king of vānaras, and let Aṅgada be
  consecrated. Seeing your son seated upon the throne, you will attain peace.
'12': >-
  She—Tārā—oppressed by the calamity that had befallen her husband, hearing his
  words, spoke in reply to Hanumān who stood before her.
'13': >-
  Even if I had a hundred sons equal to Aṅgada in form, for this hero who has
  been slain, the embracing of his limbs is better than all of that.
'14': >-
  And I have no power over either the vānaras’ kingdom or over Aṅgada. His
  paternal uncle Sugrīva stands next to him and is foremost in all affairs.
'15': >-
  This resolve should not be entertained, O Hanumān, with regard to Aṅgada; for
  the father is the true kinsman of the son, not the mother, O best of vānaras.
'16': >-
  For me there is nothing more fitting—either here or hereafter—than taking
  refuge in the king of vānaras. This very couch, frequented by the slain hero
  and facing toward him, is what is fitting for me to lie upon and to serve.
'17': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-first chapter, named “Hanumān’s Consolation,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
