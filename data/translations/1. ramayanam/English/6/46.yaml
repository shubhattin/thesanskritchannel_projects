  Now begins the forty-sixth chapter in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Lamentation beginning with Sugrīva.”
'1': >-
  Then those dwellers of the forest, looking about at the sky and the earth,
  beheld the two brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, covered over with an unbroken
  shower of arrows.
'2': >-
  When the rain of arrows had ceased, and the rākṣasa had finished his deed,
  Vibhīṣaṇa came to that place together with Sugrīva.
'3': >-
  Nīla, and Dvivida, Mainda, Suṣeṇa, Kumuda, and Aṅgada—swiftly, along with
  Hanumān—followed after them, lamenting for the two Rāghavas.
'4': >-
  Motionless, breathing faintly, flooded with blood, covered with a net of
  arrows, rigid and lying there upon a bed of shafts—thus did the two appear.
'5': >-
  Breathing like serpents, without movement and with their prowess dulled, their
  limbs smeared with flowing blood—like two golden standards stained and cast
  down, they lay.
'6': >-
  Those two heroes lay upon a hero’s couch, their movements faint, surrounded by
  their own troop-leaders, whose eyes were troubled with tears.
'7': >-
  Seeing the two Rāghavas fallen and encompassed by that web of arrows, all the
  vānaras together with Vibhīṣaṇa were seized with anguish.
'8': >-
  The vānaras, looking into the mid-air and toward all the quarters, did not
  behold Rāvaṇa’s son in battle, concealed as he was by illusion.
'9': >-
  But Vibhīṣaṇa, himself discerning illusion by illusion, saw before him the son
  of his brother—standing there—whose deeds were unrivalled and who had no equal
  adversary in combat.
'10': >-
  By virtue of a boon, Vibhīṣaṇa beheld that hero though hidden—endowed with
  splendor, renown, and valor.
'11': >-
  Indrajit, having looked upon the two lying there, said—supremely
  delighted—gladdening all the rākṣasas:
'12': >-
  “The slayers of Dūṣaṇa and the mighty Khara—those brothers Rāma and
  Lakṣmaṇa—have been struck down by the arrows of my own host.
'13': >-
  “These two cannot be released from this bondage of arrows—even if all were to
  assemble together: the gods and asuras with the companies of ṛṣis.
'14': >-
  “For whose sake my father, afflicted with grief and lost in anxious thought,
  passes the night—three watches long—without his limbs even touching his couch.
'15': >-
  “For whose sake all Laṅkā has been in turmoil, like a river in the rainy
  season—this root-cause, this calamity to all, has now been quelled by me.
'16': >-
  “Rāma’s and Lakṣmaṇa’s, and indeed of all the forest-dwellers—their valor has
  become fruitless, like rain-clouds in autumn.”
'17': >-
  Having thus spoken while all those rākṣasas looked on, that son of Rāvaṇa then
  struck even all those troop-leaders.
'18': >-
  Having smitten Nīla with nine arrows, and likewise Mainda and Dvivida, that
  slayer of foes tormented them with three and three exceedingly fierce shafts.
'19': >-
  That great archer, piercing Jāmbavān in the chest with an arrow, released ten
  arrows upon swift Hanumān.
'20': >-
  And upon Gavākṣa and Śarabha too—both of immeasurable prowess—the mighty
  Rāvaṇa’s son in battle pierced them with two and two arrows.
'21': >-
  And then he, hurrying, pierced Golāṅgūleśvara and also Aṅgada, the son of
  Vāli, with many arrows.
'22': >-
  Having wounded those foremost of vānaras with shafts like tongues of fire,
  that powerful one—of great might—roared aloud there.
'23': >-
  Having crushed them with a flood of arrows and having terrified the vānaras,
  the mighty-armed one laughed and spoke these words:
'24': >-
  “By a dreadful binding of arrows, I have bound these two brothers at the head
  of the army—behold it, O rākṣasas!”
'25': >-
  Thus addressed, all those rākṣasas—deceitful fighters—were struck with the
  highest amazement, rejoicing at that deed.
'26': >-
  All of them, resembling rain-clouds, raised great cries; and knowing, “Rāma is
  slain,” they honored and acclaimed Rāvaṇa’s son.
'27': >-
  Then, seeing the two brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa lying motionless, without
  breath upon the earth, they concluded, “They are slain.”
'28': >-
  Seized with joy, Indrajit, the conqueror in battle, entered the city of Laṅkā,
  gladdening all the rākṣasas.
'29': >-
  Seeing the bodies of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa heaped with arrows, and their limbs and
  minor limbs all struck, fear entered Sugrīva.
'30': >-
  To that terrified lord of vānaras—his face wet with tears, wretched, his eyes
  confused with grief—Vibhīṣaṇa spoke:
'31': >-
  “Enough of fear, Sugrīva; restrain the rush of tears. Such is the nature of
  battles; victory is not assured as a certainty.
'32': >-
  “If there yet remains a portion of good fortune for us, these great-souled,
  mighty heroes will cast off this delusion.
'33': >-
  “Compose yourself, O Vānara—and steady me as well, who am without refuge. For
  those devoted to truth and righteousness have no fear produced by death.
'34': >-
  Having spoken thus, with his hand wet with water, Vibhīṣaṇa then wiped
  Sugrīva’s auspicious eyes.
'35': >-
  Then, taking water and murmuring spells over it with knowledge,
  righteous-souled Vibhīṣaṇa wiped Sugrīva’s eyes.
'36': >-
  Having wiped the face of that wise king of the monkeys, he spoke these words,
  timely and unbewildered:
'37': >-
  “This is not the time, O lord of monkey-kings, to resort to faint-heartedness.
  Even excessive affection at such a time becomes an instrument of death.
'38': >-
  “Therefore, casting off faint-heartedness—which ruins every
  undertaking—consider what is beneficial for the armies with Rāma at their
  head.
'39': >-
  “Or else, let Rāma be protected until this loss of consciousness passes; for
  when the Kakutsthas regain awareness, they will dispel our fear.
'40': >-
  “This is nothing at all for Rāma, nor does Rāma wish to die; for fortune does
  not forsake him—fortune that is hard to obtain for those whose span of life is
  ended.
'41': >-
  “Therefore, reassure yourself, and reassure your own forces, while I once more
  restore all the armies to their proper order.”
'42': >-
  “For these have eyes wide with terror, fear having arisen from panic; from ear
  to ear it is being whispered among the monkeys, O best of vānaras.
'43': >-
  “But seeing me running forth, that host will become gladdened; let the monkeys
  abandon their fear, as one casts away a garland already enjoyed.”
'44': >-
  Thus having comforted Sugrīva, Vibhīṣaṇa—lord among rākṣasas—again reassured
  that monkey-host which had fled in disorder.
'45': >-
  But Indrajit, the wielder of mighty illusion, surrounded by the whole army,
  entered the city of Laṅkā and approached his father.
'46': >-
  There, coming up to Rāvaṇa, and bowing with joined palms, he related pleasing
  tidings to his father: “Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa have been laid low.”
'47': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa sprang up in delight amid the rākṣasas and embraced his son,
  having heard that his enemies had been felled.
'48': >-
  And smelling his son upon the head, with a heart full of joy, he questioned
  him; and the son, being questioned, reported to his father all that had
  occurred.
'49': >-
  —how those two had been made motionless and bereft of radiance by the binding
  of arrows.
'50': >-
  Hearing the words of that great chariot-warrior, and with his inner self swept
  along by the surge of joy, Rāvaṇa cast off the fever that had arisen from fear
  of the son of Daśaratha, and with delighted speech he rejoiced over his son.
'51': >-
  Thus ends the forty-sixth chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first of poets, entitled “The
  Lamentation beginning with Sugrīva.”
