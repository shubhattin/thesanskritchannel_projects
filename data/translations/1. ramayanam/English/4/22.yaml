  Now begins the twenty-second sarga of the Kishkindha-kanda of the glorious
  Valmiki Ramayana, called “Vāli’s Instruction (to Sugrīva).”
'1': >-
  But Vāli, his senses failing, looking all around and breathing only faintly,
  beheld at the very outset Sugrīva, his younger brother, standing before him.
'2': >-
  Vāli, who had attained victory (in that combat), addressed Sugrīva, lord of
  the monkeys; and, in clear words spoken with affection, he said this:
'3': >-
  “Sugrīva, through fault and sin you ought not to regard me so—me who am being
  dragged along by destiny, my understanding bewildered, and brought low by
  force.
'4': >-
  “I do not deem this course, taken at once in such a manner, to be for the
  happiness of us both, dear brother; for the brotherly friendship that should
  have been joined with affection has now come to be otherwise.
'5': >-
  “Do you this very day take up the sovereignty of these dwellers in the forest;
  and know that I, going hence today, am going to the abode of Vaivasvata
  (Yama), the lord of death.
'6': >-
  “Life, kingdom, and abundant prosperity—all these I now quickly abandon, as
  well as fame that is free from blame.
'7': >-
  “In this condition, O hero, I shall tell you words; even if they are hard to
  carry out, O king, you must indeed do them.
'8': >-
  “Behold this child Aṅgada, fit for happiness and reared in happiness, yet no
  fool—his face full of tears, fallen upon the ground.
'9': >-
  “He is dearer to me than my very life—my son, as though my own flesh-born son.
  When I am gone, though he may not know what is best for him, protect him on
  every side.
'10': >-
  “You too are his father—his benefactor and protector in every way; in times of
  fear, be the giver of fearlessness to him, just as I have been, O lord of the
  monkeys.
'11': >-
  “This is Tārā’s illustrious son, equal to you in prowess; in the slaying of
  the rākṣasas he shall stand in your forefront.
'12': >-
  “This son of Tārā—radiant, youthful Aṅgada—strong in battle, having displayed
  valor, will perform deeds befitting his nature.
'13': >-
  “And this daughter of Suṣeṇa is skilled in the subtle ascertainment of
  matters, and is well-established in every way in regard to diverse portents
  and omens.
'14': >-
  “Whatever she says is proper—do that without doubt; for in no case does Tārā’s
  judgment turn out otherwise.
'15': >-
  “And Rāghava’s task too must be carried out by you without hesitation; for
  there would be adharma in not doing it, and he, if dishonored, might bring
  harm upon you.
'16': >-
  “Put on this divine golden garland, O Sugrīva. Noble fortune abides in it;
  when I am dead, it should be transferred (to you).”
'17': >-
  Thus addressed by Vāli out of brotherly affection, Sugrīva—having set aside
  his joy—again became despondent, like the lord of the stars (the moon) seized
  by Rahu.
'18': >-
  Then, calmed by Vāli’s words, doing what was proper, and unwearied, he—having
  been granted permission—accepted that very golden garland.
'19': >-
  Having given that golden garland, and seeing his own son standing there,
  Vāli—ready to enter the state after death—spoke to Aṅgada out of affection:
'20': >-
  “From today, heed place and time, bearing patiently with what is pleasant and
  unpleasant; enduring happiness and sorrow in their season, remain subject to
  Sugrīva.”
'21': >-
  “For as you, mighty-armed one, have been constantly cherished by me, so
  Sugrīva does not greatly regard you as you are now accustomed to be.”
'22': >-
  “Do not go over to the enemies of this kingdom; do not go to the foes, O
  subduer of enemies. Disciplined, intent on your master’s welfare, remain
  subject to Sugrīva.”
'23': >-
  “And excessive intimacy should not be made, nor should you practice the
  absence of intimacy; both are, indeed, great faults. Therefore, be one who
  keeps an inner watch and maintains discretion.”
'24': >-
  Having spoken thus, his eyes turning upward, grievously tormented by the
  pressure of the arrows, with terrible teeth bared, Vāli’s life-breath
  departed.
'25': >-
  Then the monkeys there, their leader slain, cried out aloud—those foremost of
  monkey-warriors, all lamenting.
'26': >-
  “Kishkindhā is today bereft, now that the lord of monkeys has gone to heaven;
  empty too are its pleasure-groves, its mountains, and its forests.”
'27': >-
  “When the tiger among monkeys is slain, the monkeys are made lusterless—he by
  whose great speed the woods and forests”
'28': >-
  “are bound and covered with masses of blossoms—who will now do that today? He
  who gave a mighty battle to the great-souled Gandharva—”
'29': >-
  “to Golabha, the great-armed one, for fifteen years—by night and by day—that
  battle never came to an end.”
'30': >-
  “Then in the sixteenth year Golabha was struck down. Having slain that
  ill-disciplined one, Vāli, with fangs and tusks terrible, the maker of
  fearlessness for us all—how has he now been brought down?”
'31': >-
  When that heroic lord of the monkeys was slain, then the monkeys there found
  no peace—like cattle in a great forest infested by lions, when the lord of the
  herd has been killed.
'32': >-
  Then Tārā, plunged into an ocean of calamity, looking upon the face of her
  dead husband, went down to the ground, embracing Vāli—like a clinging creeper
  that has fallen upon a great tree cut down.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-second sarga, called “Vāli’s Instruction,” in the
  Kishkindha-kanda of the ancient epic, the holy Valmiki Ramayana.
