  Now begins the sixty-fifth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Prayer for the Pacification of Wrath.”
'1': >-
  At that time Rāma, tormented by the abduction of Sītā, was burning with
  anguish—like the cosmic, world-consuming fire at the time of dissolution, fit
  to bring about the destruction of the worlds.
'2': >-
  He kept looking, again and again, at his bow strung and ready; he was heaving
  deep sighs repeatedly—desiring to burn the entire universe, like Rudra at the
  end of the age.
'3': >-
  Seeing Rāma thus, enraged in a way never before witnessed, Lakṣmaṇa, with
  palms joined in reverence, addressed him—his mouth grown dry (with distress).
'4': >-
  Formerly you were gentle and self-controlled, ever intent on the welfare of
  all beings. You ought not, overcome by wrath, to abandon your natural
  disposition.
'5': >-
  Splendour abides in the moon; radiance in the sun; motion in the wind;
  forbearance upon the earth. Thus too in you, eternally and unfailingly, there
  is that unsurpassed glory (and noble fame).
'6': >-
  For the offence of a single person, you should not slay (or destroy) the
  worlds. Indeed, I do not know whose this war-chariot is that lies broken.
'7': >-
  By whom, or for what reason, is this chariot—together with its yoke and all
  its equipment—scarred by the hooves and the rims of wheels, and sprinkled with
  drops of blood?
'8': >-
  The ground shows that a battle has taken place—most dreadful, O prince. Yet
  this is but the clash of one alone, not of two, O best among speakers.
'9': >-
  For I do not see here any trace of a great host’s might. Therefore for the
  sake of one (culprit alone) you ought not to bring ruin upon the worlds.
'10': >-
  Kings who are gentle are indeed those who restrain and punish rightly; they
  are calm. You, at all times, are the refuge of all beings—the supreme resort.
'11': >-
  Who would not deem your loss of your wife a grievous wrong, O Rāghava? (All
  would know it to be so)—the rivers, the oceans, the mountains, and the gods,
  Gandharvas, and Dānavas as well.
'12': >-
  The righteous are not able to do what is displeasing to you—like ascetics
  consecrated by a vow. Therefore, O king, you should seek out him by whom Sītā
  has been carried away.
'13': >-
  I, as your second—bow in hand—together with allies who are great seers, shall
  search: the ocean, the mountains, and the forests.
'14': >-
  We shall also search, with minds intent, the many dreadful caves, the various
  lotus-lakes, and even the worlds of the gods and Gandharvas.
'15': >-
  Until we discover the abductor of your wife—if the lords of the thirty gods do
  not, by conciliation, restore your consort to you—then thereafter, O lord of
  Kośala, you will do what is timely (and fitting to the occasion).
'16': >-
  If, O king among men, by good conduct, by conciliation, by humility, and by
  rightful policy you do not regain Sītā, then utterly lay waste (your foes)
  with torrents of arrows with golden shafts, resembling Indra’s thunderbolt.
'17': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fifth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the primordial epic, entitled “The Prayer for the Pacification of Wrath.”
