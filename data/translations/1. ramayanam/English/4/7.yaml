  Then, in the holy and glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa,
  begins the Seventh Sarga, named “Rāma’s Consolation (to Sugrīva).”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, the monkey Sugrīva—himself afflicted—spoke with joined
  palms; his words were accompanied by tears, and his voice choked with sobbing.
'2': >-
  “I do not, in any manner, know the dwelling-place of that sinful rākṣasa; nor
  do I know his power, nor his prowess, nor even the lineage or clan of that
  low-born one.”
'3': >-
  “But this I truly promise you—abandon grief, O subduer of foes: I shall make
  such an effort that you will regain Maithilī.”
'4': >-
  “Having slain Rāvaṇa together with his followers, and having thereby satisfied
  your own manly valor, I shall act so that before long you will become glad at
  heart.”
'5': >-
  “Enough of clinging to dejection; remember the firmness that is within your
  own self. For men like you, such lightness and feebleness of understanding is
  not fitting.”
'6': >-
  “Even I have fallen into a great calamity born of separation from my wife; yet
  I do not grieve in this manner, nor do I abandon fortitude.”
'7': >-
  “Though I am but a common monkey, I do not lament for her like this. How much
  more, then, should you—great-souled, disciplined, and steadfast—remain firm!”
'8': >-
  “The tears that have arisen must be restrained by steadfastness; you ought to
  hold them back. You ought not cast away composure—the proper measure (maryādā)
  of those endowed with inner strength.”
'9': >-
  “In calamity, or in the straits of need, or in fear, or even when life is at
  its very end, a steadfast man, reflecting with his own understanding, does not
  sink into despair.”
'10': >-
  “But the foolish man who ever follows helpless dejection sinks involuntarily
  into sorrow—like a boat, weighed down with a heavy load, sinking in water.”
'11': >-
  “This salutation with joined hands I make in affection, to win your favor.
  Take refuge in valor; you ought not give sorrow any place within you.”
'12': >-
  “Those who keep following grief have no happiness. Their radiance, too,
  dwindles away; therefore you ought not to grieve.”
'13': >-
  “For one overwhelmed by grief, even life itself becomes doubtful. Therefore
  cast off sorrow, O lord of kings, and take refuge in fortitude alone.”
'14': >-
  “I speak for your good, in the spirit of friendship; I am not instructing you
  as a superior. Honoring my friendship, you ought not to grieve.”
'15': >-
  Thus sweetly consoled by Sugrīva, Rāghava wiped his face—wet with tears—with
  the edge of his garment.
'16': >-
  Then Kakutstha, the mighty lord, having regained his natural composure through
  Sugrīva’s words, embraced Sugrīva and spoke these words:
'17': >-
  “What should be done by a friend—one who is affectionate, well-wishing,
  fitting to the occasion, and proper—this, O Sugrīva, has been done by you.”
'18': >-
  “And I, O friend, have been restored to myself and appeased by you. Such a
  kinsman is hard indeed to find—especially in such a time as this.”
'19': >-
  “Yet effort must be made by you in the search for Maithilī, and (in seeking
  information) about that cruel rākṣasa, the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa.”
'20': >-
  “And whatever is to be undertaken by me—tell me that confidently. As in the
  rainy season upon good land, everything will prosper for you.”
'21': >-
  “And whatever word of mine was spoken out of self-regard—O tiger among
  monkeys—let that be understood by you as truth, as the real state of things.”
'22': >-
  “I have never spoken falsehood before, nor shall I ever speak it. This I
  promise you; by truth itself I swear.”
'23': >-
  Then Sugrīva, delighted, together with his monkey ministers, having heard
  Rāghava’s words—his pledge in particular—became exceedingly glad.
'24': >-
  Thus, having come into intimate confidence with one another, those two—man and
  monkey—spoke of their happiness and their sorrow, each finding the other like
  himself (in feeling).
'25': >-
  Hearing the words of that king of men, of great might and noble spirit, the
  foremost of heroic monkeys—wise in heart—deemed that his task had been
  accomplished then and there.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the Seventh Sarga, named “Rāma’s Consolation,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
