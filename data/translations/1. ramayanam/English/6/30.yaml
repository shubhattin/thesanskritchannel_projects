  Now begins the Thirtieth Sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Enumeration of the Vānara Host.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter the spies reported to the lord of Laṅkā about that irresistible
  army—how Rāghava had taken position upon the mountain Suvela.
'2': >-
  Hearing from the spies that mighty Rāma had arrived, Rāvaṇa became somewhat
  agitated and, addressing Śārdūla, spoke these words.
'3': >-
  “Your account is not as it should be, and you appear dejected, O night-ranger.
  Have you by any chance fallen into the power of my enemies when they were
  enraged?”
'4': >-
  Thus admonished by him, Śārdūla—fear-stricken—then, in a subdued voice,
  addressed the tiger among rākṣasas.
'5': >-
  “O King, those foremost of vānaras cannot be spied upon. They are valiant,
  mighty, and protected by Rāghava.
'6': >-
  “Nor is it possible to converse with them; no opportunity for inquiry is
  obtained. On every side the paths are guarded by the vānaras, who are like
  mountains.
'7': >-
  “The moment I entered that host and began to look about, I was recognized.
  Seized by force by those rākṣasas—(those vānaras) examined me in many ways.
'8': >-
  “I was struck severely with knees, fists, teeth, and the palms of their hands,
  and I was dragged by those intolerant (unyielding) monkeys into the midst of
  the army.
'9': >-
  “Dragging me about everywhere, they then led me into the assembly of Rāma—my
  limbs miserable and streaming with blood, I was bewildered, my senses shaken.
'10': >-
  “Even as the monkeys were slaying me, while I begged with joined palms,
  Rāghava protected me, saying ‘Do not kill him,’ of his own accord.
'11': >-
  “Having filled the great ocean with mountain-rocks, Rāma stands at the gate of
  Laṅkā, weapon in hand.
'12': >-
  “Arrayed in the formation called the Garuḍa, and surrounded on every side by
  vānaras, that great radiant one—after releasing me—presses straight toward
  Laṅkā itself.
'13': >-
  “He will quickly come up to the rampart; decide swiftly upon one of two
  courses: either promptly give Sītā, or let battle be granted.”
'14': >-
  Considering that in his mind and hearing it, the lord of rākṣasas then spoke
  to Śārdūla these very weighty words.
'15': >-
  “Even if gods, gandharvas, and dānavas were to fight against me, I would not
  give Sītā—not even out of fear of all the worlds.”
'16': >-
  Having spoken thus, the mighty and radiant Rāvaṇa spoke again: “You have
  observed the army—who here are the heroic plavaṅgamas?
'17': >-
  “Of what appearance are those hard-to-approach vānaras, O gentle one? Whose
  sons and grandsons are they? Declare the truth to me, O rākṣasa.”
'18': >-
  “Having known their strength and weakness, I shall then proceed accordingly.
  Surely enumeration is to be done by one who desires war.”
'19': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāvaṇa, Śārdūla—the foremost of spies—began to speak these
  words in Rāvaṇa’s presence:
'20': >-
  “There is Jāmbavān, famed by that name—son of Ṛkṣarajas—invincible in battle,
  O King, and (also) the son of Gadgada is here.”
'21': >-
  “And another son of Gadgada is here—(also) the son of the preceptor of
  Śatakratu (Indra)—by whose single son great slaughter of the rākṣasas was
  wrought.
'22': >-
  “And here is Suṣeṇa, righteous-souled and valorous, the son of Dharma; and
  here too, O King, is the pleasing monkey Dadhimukha, the son of Soma.
'23': >-
  “Here are Sumukha and Durmukha, and also the vānara named Vegadarśin. Surely
  Death himself, in the form of a monkey, has been created by the Self-born
  (Brahmā).”
'24': >-
  “Here is Nīla, the son of Huta-vaha (Agni), himself the commander of the army;
  and here is Hanūmān, famed as the son of Anila (the Wind).”
'25': >-
  “There is the young Aṅgada—mighty, the grandson of Śakra (Indra), and hard to
  assail; and Mainda and Dvivida, both powerful, born of the Aśvins.”
'26': >-
  “Then there are five sons of Vaivasvata (Yama), like the Destroyer at the end
  of time: Gaja, Gavākṣa, Gavaya, Śarabha, and Gandhamādana.”
'27': >-
  “There are ten koṭis of heroic vānaras, eager for battle—glorious, sons of the
  gods. The rest I do not dare to recount.
'28': >-
  “This is the son of Daśaratha, youthful, with a lion-like frame—by whom Dūṣaṇa
  was slain, and Khara, and Triśiras as well.
'29': >-
  “On earth there is none equal to Rāma in prowess—he by whom Virādha was slain,
  and Kabandha too, who was like Death itself.
'30': >-
  “No man upon the earth is able to declare Rāma’s virtues; he by whom so many
  rākṣasas dwelling in Janasthāna were slain.
'31': >-
  “And here is Lakṣmaṇa, righteous-souled, like a bull among elephants; reaching
  the range of his arrows, even Vāsava (Indra) would not remain alive.
'32': >-
  “Śveta and Jyotirmukha are here, both sprung from Bhāskara (the Sun); and then
  there is Hemakūṭa, the plavaṅgama who is the son of Varuṇa.
'33': >-
  “The heroic Nala, son of Viśvakarman, the foremost of monkeys, is here; and
  here too is the valiant, swift, and unassailable son of the Vasus.
'34': >-
  “And your younger brother Vibhīṣaṇa, the best among rākṣasas, having accepted
  (Rāma’s protection) and intent on Rāghava’s welfare, has taken
  refuge—(seeking) Laṅkā-city.”
'35': >-
  “Thus all has been fully related—the vānara army positioned upon Mount Suvela.
  In what remains to be done, you are the course (the one on whom the next step
  depends).”
'36': >-
  Thus ends the Thirtieth Sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the holy, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the first epic, entitled “The Enumeration of the Vānara
  Host.”
