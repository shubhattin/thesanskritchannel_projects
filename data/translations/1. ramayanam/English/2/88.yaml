  Now begins the eighty-eighth sarga of the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Viewing of the Bed (Śayyānuvīkṣaṇam).”
'1': >-
  Hearing all that—set forth clearly and in full—Bharata, together with the
  ministers, came to the root of an ingudī tree; and there he beheld that couch
  (made upon the ground) of Rāma.
'2': >-
  Then all the mothers spoke: “Here, upon this ground, the great-souled one lay
  during the night. This spot is pressed and smoothed by his body.”
'3': >-
  “Rāma, born on earth to Daśaratha—highly fortunate, of noble lineage, greatly
  illustrious and wise—does not deserve to sleep upon the bare ground.”
'4': >-
  “When a spread of deer-skin is laid above, and choice coverings are heaped as
  bedding, how does the tiger among men lie thus on the surface of the earth?”
'5': >-
  “He, who ever dwelt in the lofty aerial mansions and palatial terraces, upon
  splendid couches—on floors of gold and silver—on beds furnished with excellent
  coverings—”
'6': >-
  “—adorned with arrangements of flowers, fragrant with sandal and aloe-wood;
  bright as pale clouds; resonant with the chirping of flocks of parrots—”
'7': >-
  “—having lived in the foremost of palaces, cool to the touch and
  sweet-smelling, like Meru itself, with walls fashioned of wrought gold—”
'8': >-
  “—ever awakened by the clamour of songs and instruments, by the jingling of
  splendid ornaments, and by the fine sounds of drums—”
'9': >-
  “—praised at the proper times by bards, by many sūtas and māgadhas, with
  fitting ballads and eulogies—he, the scourger of foes—”
'10': >-
  “This is beyond belief in the world; it does not appear to me as truth. Truly
  my mind is confounded; I think, ‘This is a dream.’”
'11': >-
  “Surely there is no power like Destiny, mightier than Time—since the son of
  Daśaratha, Rāma, lies thus upon the ground.”
'12': >-
  “And Sītā, the fair-to-behold daughter of the king of
  Videha—beloved—Daśaratha’s daughter-in-law—she too lies upon the earth!”
'13': >-
  Bharata said: “This is my brother’s bed indeed; here everything has been
  turned over. On this hard patch of ground the grass is wholly pressed down and
  smoothed by his limbs.”
'14': >-
  “I deem that Sītā slept here then, still wearing her ornaments; for here and
  there are seen clinging drops and specks of gold.”
'15': >-
  “Here, her upper cloth is caught and plainly visible; thus do these threads of
  fine silk appear, adhering to the place.”
'16': >-
  “I think the bed is made pleasant by her lord; for that young woman, though
  practicing austerities—tender, delicate, and chaste—Mithilā’s princess does
  not comprehend suffering.”
'17': >-
  “Alas! I am undone; I am cruel indeed—because on my account Rāghava, with his
  wife, lies on such a bed, as though he were helpless and without refuge.”
'18': >-
  “Born in the line of universal sovereigns, bringing happiness to all the
  worlds, beloved of all the worlds—having abandoned his dear, unsurpassed
  kingdom—”
'19': >-
  “How does Rāghava—dark as a blue lotus, red-eyed, pleasing to behold, entitled
  to happiness—how does he deserve sorrow, lying upon the earth?”
'20': >-
  “Blessed indeed, greatly fortunate, is Lakṣmaṇa of auspicious marks, who
  follows Rāma, his brother, in this time of adversity.”
'21': >-
  “Truly accomplished is Vaidehī, who has followed her husband into the forest;
  but we all are left in doubt and uncertainty, bereft of that great-souled
  one.”
'22': >-
  “The earth seems to me as though void of ears (unheeding, without a hearer),
  as if empty—since Daśaratha has gone to heaven and Rāma has taken refuge in
  the wilderness.”
'23': >-
  “And no one, not even in thought, covets the earth, guarded by the might of
  his arms—even while he dwells in the forest.”
'24': >-
  “The capital lies with its defenses empty, its horses and elephants
  uncontrolled, its city-gates left open—unprotected.”
'25': >-
  “With its army joyless and diminished, placed in a perilous state and
  uncovered—enemies do not attack it, as though it were food made poisonous.”
'26': >-
  “From today onward I too shall sleep upon the ground, or upon grass; ever
  eating fruits and roots, wearing matted hair and bark-garments.”
'27': >-
  “For that purpose, for the remainder of time, I shall dwell happily in the
  forest. Having taken up that vow, it shall not prove false.”
'28': >-
  “Śatrughna shall not follow me, since I will dwell for my brother’s sake; but
  that noble prince, together with Lakṣmaṇa, shall protect Ayodhyā.”
'29': >-
  “May the twice-born in Ayodhyā consecrate the Kakutstha (Rāma). And may the
  gods grant me this true desire of my heart—if I myself, bowing my head in
  supplication, seek their grace in many ways, and if it is not otherwise
  denied.”
'30': >-
  “Then, for a long time, I shall console Rāghava—dwelling in the forest—so that
  he may not reject me, nor look upon me with disregard.”
'31': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-eighth sarga, called “The Viewing of the Bed
  (Śayyānuvīkṣaṇam),” in the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  ancient epic (Ādikāvya).
