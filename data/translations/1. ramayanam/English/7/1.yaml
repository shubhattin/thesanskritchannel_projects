  Now begins the First Canto, called “Rāma’s Questions,” in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of
  the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  When Rāma had regained his kingdom and the slaying of the rākṣasas had been
  accomplished, all the ṛṣis came to Rāghava, to congratulate and gladden him.
'2': >-
  Then Kauśika, and Yavakrīta, and Gārgya, and Gālava too, and Kaṇva, the son of
  Medhātithi—those who dwelt in the eastern quarter—came as well.
'3': >-
  And Svastyātreya; and the Blessed Lord Namucci, and Pramucci likewise—those
  who dwelt in the southern quarter—came, along with Agastya.
'4': >-
  Nṛṣadgu, Kavaṣa, Dhaumya, and the great ṛṣi Raudreya—these too came with their
  disciples, those who dwelt in the western quarter.
'5': >-
  Vasiṣṭha, and Kaśyapa, and Atri, and Viśvāmitra together with Gautama;
  Jamadagni and Bharadvāja—those also, the Seven Ṛṣis, likewise came.
'6': These seven are the constant dwellers in the northern quarter.
'7': >-
  Having reached the dwelling of Rāghava, those great-souled ones stood there,
  awaiting admission—radiant like the sacrificial fire; knowers of the Vedas and
  the Vedāṅgas, and deeply versed in diverse śāstras.
'8': >-
  Then the righteous-souled Agastya, the foremost of sages, spoke to the
  doorkeeper: “Inform Daśaratha’s son that we ṛṣis have arrived here.”
'9': >-
  Thereupon the chamberlain, at Agastya’s word, quickly and without delay
  entered at once into the presence of the great-souled Rāghava.
'10': >-
  Wise in discerning intention, of good conduct, capable, and endowed with
  steadfastness—he saw Rāma, suddenly, resplendent like the full moon,
'11': and told him that Agastya had arrived, along with the ṛṣis.
'12': >-
  Hearing that those sages had come—radiant like the young rising sun—Rāma then
  replied to the doorkeeper: “Let them enter, comfortably and at their ease.”
'13': >-
  Seeing the sages who had arrived, he rose to greet them, with joined palms,
  and honored them with offerings of water for washing the feet, arghya, and the
  like, and with reverence presented them with a cow.
'14': >-
  Rāma, after saluting them with due humility, then directed that seats be
  brought—great and excellent ones, adorned with gold and wondrously inlaid.
'15': >-
  Covered with kuśa-grass and furnished with deer-skins, those bull-like sages
  took their seats thereon, each according to his rank and due honor.
'16': >-
  When Rāma asked after their welfare, the great ṛṣis—knowers of the
  Vedas—together with their disciples and attendants, spoke these words to Rāma:
'17': >-
  “All is well with us everywhere, O mighty-armed one, O delighter of the Raghu
  line. By good fortune we behold you well and safe, with your foes laid low.
'18': >-
  By good fortune, O king, you have slain Rāvaṇa, the terror of the worlds.
  Indeed, O Rāma, Rāvaṇa—though possessed of sons and grandsons—was no burden
  too heavy for you.
'19': >-
  For, bow in hand, you would surely conquer the three worlds—of this there is
  no doubt. By good fortune, O Rāma, you have slain Rāvaṇa, lord of the
  rākṣasas.
'20': >-
  By good fortune, today we behold you victorious, together with Sītā, and with
  Lakṣmaṇa also—your righteous-souled brother, ever devoted to your welfare.
'21': >-
  Today, O king, we behold you together with your mothers and your brothers. By
  good fortune, those night-rangers—Prahasta, Vikaṭa, Virūpākṣa, Mahodara, and
  the unassailable Akampana—have been slain by you.
'22': >-
  He whose vast measure has no equal measure in this world—by good fortune, O
  Rāma, Kumbhakarṇa has been felled by you in battle.
'23': >-
  Triśiras and Atikāya, Devāntaka and Narāntaka—by good fortune, O Rāma, those
  night-rangers of great valor have been slain by you.
'24': >-
  And Kumbha and Nikumbha, the two rākṣasas of dreadful aspect—the sons of
  Kumbhakarṇa—by good fortune, O Rāma, those two were slain by you in the fight.
'25': >-
  And Yuddhonmatta and Matta—like Kālāntaka and Yama; and the mighty rākṣasa
  named Dhūmrākṣa, inflamed with fury in battle—
'26': >-
  those masters of weapons and missiles, working dreadful slaughter—by good
  fortune they were destroyed by you with arrows like Death itself.
'27': >-
  By good fortune you engaged the lord of rākṣasas in single combat, and, though
  he was invincible even by the gods, you attained victory.
'28': >-
  In open battle there was, as it were, no defeat for Rāvaṇa; yet when he came
  to single combat, by good fortune Rāvaṇa’s son has been slain by you.
'29': >-
  By good fortune, O mighty-armed one, you were delivered from that hero—enemy
  of the gods—rushing on like Time itself; and victory was attained by you.
'30': >-
  We all rejoice in you, having heard of Indrajit’s death—for in battle he was
  the bearer of vast illusion, and invincible to all beings.
'31': And this is a great wonder to us, hearing that Indrajit was slain.
'32': >-
  These and many other rākṣasas, able to assume forms at will—by good fortune, O
  hero, they have been slain by you, O increaser of the Raghu dynasty.
'33': >-
  Having bestowed this holy, gracious gift of fearlessness as dakṣiṇā, by good
  fortune you prosper, O scion of Kakutstha—through victory, O subduer of
  enemies.
'34': >-
  But hearing the words of those sages of disciplined souls, Rāma, filled with
  the highest astonishment, spoke with joined palms:
'35': >-
  “O venerable ones, passing over Kumbhakarṇa and Rāvaṇa, those two
  night-rangers of great might—why do you praise Rāvaṇa’s son?
'36': >-
  Passing over Mahodara and Prahasta, and the rākṣasa Virūpākṣa; and the two
  hard-to-overcome ones, Matta and Unmatta; and the mighty Devāntaka and
  Narāntaka—why do you praise Rāvaṇa’s son, passing over such heroes of great
  valor?
'37': >-
  Passing over Atikāya, Triśiras, and Dhūmrākṣa the night-ranger—passing over
  such heroes of great valor—why do you praise Rāvaṇa’s son?
'38': >-
  What, indeed, is his puissance? What his strength? What his heroism? And for
  what reason does he surpass Rāvaṇa himself?
'39': >-
  If it may be heard by me, I do not command you as one issuing orders. If it is
  not secret and may be spoken, I desire to hear—let it be told.
'40': >-
  Even Śakra was conquered by him—how did he obtain boons? And how is the son
  mighty, while his father Rāvaṇa is not so (in that measure)?
'41': >-
  How, in the great battle, is he superior even to his father—how is that
  rākṣasa the conqueror of Śakra? And the boons he obtained—tell me all that
  today, O lord of sages, since I ask in full.”
'42': >-
  Thus ends the First Canto, called “Rāma’s Questions,” in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of
  the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the revered ādi-kāvya.
