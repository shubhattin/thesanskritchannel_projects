  Now begins the thirteenth chapter of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Journey to Pañcavaṭī.”
'1': >-
  “Rāma, I am pleased with you; welfare be to you. I am satisfied, O Lakṣmaṇa,
  since you have both come, together with Sītā, to pay obeisance to me.”
'2': >-
  “The fatigue of the journey and the abundant exertion are indeed troubling you
  both; and surely Maithilī, Janaka’s daughter, too longs (for rest) and is
  weary.”
'3': >-
  “And she, though delicate and tender, is not dejected by hardships. Having
  come to a forest abounding in perils, she is driven (only) by her affection
  for her husband.”
'4': >-
  “Therefore, Rāma, act in such a way that Sītā may take delight here. She has
  accomplished something difficult indeed, in coming to you in the forest.”
'5': >-
  “For such is the nature of women, O delight of the Raghu line, from the very
  creation: they cling to one who is in prosperity and forsake one who has
  fallen into adversity.”
'6': >-
  “The fickleness of one who is full of many desires, the sharpness of weapons,
  and the swiftness of Garuḍa and of the wind—women follow after these (in their
  likeness).”
'7': >-
  “But this wife of yours is free from such faults. She is praiseworthy and
  worthy to be spoken of with honor—like Arundhatī among the divine ladies.”
'8': >-
  “This region is blessed and made fair, O Rāma, where you, together with
  Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) and this Vaidehī, will dwell—O subduer of foes.”
'9': >-
  Thus addressed by the sage, Rāghava, with hands joined in reverence, spoke
  words of humility to that seer, blazing as it were like fire.
'10': >-
  “I am fortunate; I have been shown favor—since the foremost of sages, by my
  own merits and by the merits of my brother and my wife, is well pleased with
  us as with his disciples.”
'11': >-
  “But do you, O venerable one, direct me to a place—provided with water and
  rich in many woods—where I may establish a hermitage and dwell at ease, ever
  devoted to my duties.”
'12': >-
  Then the best of sages, having heard Rāma’s speech, the righteous-souled one
  reflected for a moment and thereafter spoke these auspicious words:
'13': >-
  “Two yojanas from here, dear child, lies a splendid land—rich in roots,
  fruits, and water, abounding in many deer—well known by the name Pañcavaṭī.”
'14': >-
  “Go there and, together with Saumitri, establish a hermitage-site; and dwell
  in happiness while duly fulfilling your father’s command as it was spoken.”
'15': >-
  “For, O sinless one, your entire story is known to me—both by the power of my
  austerities and through affection for Daśaratha.”
'16': >-
  “And even the wish that abides in your heart has been understood by me through
  austerity, since you have pledged to dwell here with me in this forest of
  penance.”
'17': >-
  “Therefore I say to you: go to Pañcavaṭī. That tract of woodland is
  delightful; there Maithilī will rejoice.”
'18': >-
  “That region is worthy of praise and not far away, O Rāghava; it lies near the
  Godāvarī—there Maithilī will rejoice.”
'19': >-
  “It is filled with abundant roots and fruits, frequented by flocks of many
  kinds of birds; it is secluded, O mighty-armed one—holy, and lovely as well.”
'20': >-
  “You too are of good conduct and capable of protection; moreover, dwelling
  here, O Rāma, you will safeguard the ascetics.”
'21': >-
  “This is recognized, O hero, as a great forest of madhūka trees. One who goes
  there should proceed by the northern side and pass by even the banyan
  (nyagrodha) tree.”
'22': >-
  “Then, having ascended to a level ground not far from the mountain, (you will
  reach) the place famed as Pañcavaṭī—its groves ever blooming with flowers.”
'23': >-
  Thus addressed by Agastya, Rāma, together with Saumitri, having honored him
  properly, took leave of that sage who spoke truth.
'24': >-
  And those two, having received his permission and having bowed at his feet,
  went along with Sītā to Pañcavaṭī, to that hermitage-region.
'25': >-
  Those two princes, with bows in hand and quivers fastened, unshaken in
  battles, proceeded with minds composed along the path instructed by the great
  seer, and reached Pañcavaṭī.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the thirteenth chapter of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “The Journey to Pañcavaṭī.”
