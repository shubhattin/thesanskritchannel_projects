I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness

॥ अथ श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता ॥
atha shrImadbhagavadgItA

And Now, We start the Holy Bhagavadgita

अथ द्वादशोऽध्यायः ।   भक्तियोगः
atha dvAdashoadhyAyaH    bhaktiyogaH

Thus starts the twelfth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, called as bhakti yogaH.

अर्जुन उवाच ।
arjuna uvAcha 

After having seen the fierce form of Lord Krishna as the ultimate unified form of existence, and having heard that devotion is the only means to realize and become one with that form, Arjuna had more questions, and spoke to Krishna thus:

एवं सततयुक्ता ये भक्तास्त्वां पर्युपासते ।
ये चाप्यक्षरमव्यक्तं तेषां के योगवित्तमाः ॥ १२-१॥
evaM satatayuktA ye bhaktAstvAM paryupAsate 
ye chApyakSharamavyaktaM teShAn ke yogavittamAH  12.1

Between those who are steadfastly devoted to your personified form and those who worship the formless unity, who are the ones who are better yogis?

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
shrIbhagavAnuvAcha 

Lord Krishna replied:

मय्यावेश्य मनो ये मां नित्ययुक्ता उपासते ।
श्रद्धया परयोपेताः ते मे युक्ततमा मताः ॥ १२-२॥
mayyAveshya mano ye mAM nityayuktA upAsate 
shraddhayA parayopetAH te me yuktatamA matAH  12.2

Those who fix their minds on "Me" and are always devoted to "Me" with unwavering focus, I consider them to be the best of yogis.

ये त्वक्षरमनिर्देश्यमव्यक्तं पर्युपासते ।
सर्वत्रगमचिन्त्यञ्च कूटस्थमचलन्ध्रुवम् ॥ १२-३॥
ye tvakSharamanirdeshyamavyaktaM paryupAsate 
sarvatragamachintyancha kUTasthamachalandhruvam  12.3

But those who worship the formless aspect of the Absolute Truth—the imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifest, the all-pervading, the unthinkable, the unchanging, the eternal, and the fixed,

सन्नियम्येन्द्रियग्रामं सर्वत्र समबुद्धयः ।
ते प्राप्नुवन्ति मामेव सर्वभूतहिते रताः ॥ १२-४॥
sanniyamyendriyagrAmaM sarvatra samabuddhayaH 
te prApnuvanti mAmeva sarvabhUtahite ratAH  12.4

by restraining their senses and being even-minded everywhere, such people, engaged in the welfare of all beings, they too shall attain Me.

क्लेशोऽधिकतरस्तेषामव्यक्तासक्तचेतसाम् ।
अव्यक्ता हि गतिर्दुःखं देहवद्भिरवाप्यते ॥ १२-५॥
kleshoadhikatarasteShAmavyaktAsaktachetasAm 
avyaktA hi gatirduHkhan dehavadbhiravApyate  12.5

For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifest, the path towards realization is more troublesome. 
Worship of the unmanifest is extremely difficult for embodied beings.

ये तु सर्वाणि कर्माणि मयि संन्यस्य मत्पराः ।
अनन्येनैव योगेन मां ध्यायन्त उपासते ॥ १२-६॥
ye tu sarvANi karmANi mayi sannyasya matparAH 
ananyenaiva yogena mAn dhyAyanta upAsate  12.6

But those who dedicate all their actions to Me, regarding Me as the Supreme goal, worshiping Me and meditating upon Me with exclusive devotion,

तेषामहं समुद्धर्ता मृत्युसंसारसागरात् ।
भवामि नचिरात्पार्थ मय्यावेशितचेतसाम् ॥ १२-७॥
teShAmahaM samuddhartA mRtyusansArasAgarAt 
bhavAmi nachirAtpArtha mayyAveshitachetasAm  12.7

O Partha, I swiftly deliver them from the ocean of birth and death, since their minds have entered Me.

मय्येव मन आधत्स्व मयि बुद्धिं निवेशय ।
निवसिष्यसि मय्येव अत ऊर्ध्वं न संशयः ॥ १२-८॥
mayyeva mana Adhatsva mayi buddhin niveshaya 
nivasiShyasi mayyeva ata Urdhvan na sanshayaH  12.8

Fix your mind upon Me alone and surrender your intellect to Me. 
There upon, you will always live in Me. Of this, there is no doubt.

अथ चित्तं समाधातुं न शक्नोषि मयि स्थिरम् ।
अभ्यासयोगेन ततो मामिच्छाप्तुं धनञ्जय ॥ १२-९॥
atha chittaM samAdhAtuM na shaknoShi mayi sthiram 
abhyAsayogena tato mAmichChAptuM dhananjaya  12.9

If you are unable to fix your mind steadily upon Me, O Arjuna, then practice remembering Me with devotion while constantly restraining the mind from worldly affairs.

अभ्यासेऽप्यसमर्थोऽसि मत्कर्मपरमो भव ।
मदर्थमपि कर्माणि कुर्वन्सिद्धिमवाप्स्यसि ॥ १२-१०॥
abhyAseapyasamarthoasi matkarmaparamo bhava 
madarthamapi karmANi kurvansiddhimavApsyasi  12.10

If you cannot practice remembering Me with devotion, then just try to work for Me. 
Thus performing devoted service to Me, you shall find attainment.

अथैतदप्यशक्तोऽसि कर्तुं मद्योगमाश्रितः ।
सर्वकर्मफलत्यागं ततः कुरु यतात्मवान् ॥ १२-११॥
athaitadapyashaktoasi kartuM madyogamAshritaH 
sarvakarmaphalatyAgaM tataH kuru yatAtmavAn  12.11

If you are unable to work for Me with devotion, then try to renounce the fruits of your actions and be situated in the self.

श्रेयो हि ज्ञानमभ्यासाज्ज्ञानाद्ध्यानं विशिष्यते ।
ध्यानात्कर्मफलत्यागस्त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम् ॥ १२-१२॥
shreyo hi jnAnamabhyAsAjjnAnAdhdhyAnaM vishiShyate 
dhyAnAtkarmaphalatyAgastyAgAchChAntiranantaram  12.12

True knowledge of the self leads to a greater well-being than following mere practices; Sustained meditation upon the self leads to a greater well-being than knowledge; Dis-entanglement from the fruits of action leads to even better state of well-being and even better than that is staying in a continuous ambience of inner peace.

अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानां मैत्रः करुण एव च ।
निर्ममो निरहङ्कारः समदुःखसुखः क्षमी ॥ १२-१३॥
adveShTA sarvabhUtAnAM maitraH karuNa eva cha 
nirmamo nirahankAraH samaduHkhasukhaH kShamI  12.13

Such a devotee is very dear to Me who is free from malice towards all living beings, who is friendly, and compassionate. 
Such a person, is free from attachment to possessions and ego-centrism.
Such a person, is equanimous in happiness and distress, and ever-forgiving. 

सन्तुष्टः सततं योगी यतात्मा दृढनिश्चयः ।
मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्यो मद्भक्तः स मे प्रियः ॥ १२-१४॥
santuShTaH satataM yogI yatAtmA dRDhanishchayaH 
mayyarpitamanobuddhiryo madbhaktaH sa me priyaH  12.14

Someone who is ever-contented, steadily united with Me in devotion, self-controlled, firm in conviction, and dedicated to Me in mind and intellect is very dear to Me.

यस्मान्नोद्विजते लोको लोकान्नोद्विजते च यः ।
हर्षामर्षभयोद्वेगैर्मुक्तो यः स च मे प्रियः ॥ १२-१५॥
yasmAnnodvijate loko lokAnnodvijate cha yaH 
harShAmarShabhayodvegairmukto yaH sa cha me priyaH  12.15

A person who is not a source of upleasantness to anyone and who in turn is not agitated by anyone, who is equanimous in pleasure and pain, and free from fear and anxiety, such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me.

अनपेक्षः शुचिर्दक्ष उदासीनो गतव्यथः ।
सर्वारम्भपरित्यागी यो मद्भक्तः स मे प्रियः ॥ १२-१६॥

sarvArambhaparityAgI yo madbhaktaH sa me priyaH  12.16

A person who is indifferent to worldly gain, externally and internally pure, skillful, devoid of worries, and free from selfishness in all undertakings, such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me.

यो न हृष्यति न द्वेष्टि न शोचति न काङ्क्षति ।
शुभाशुभपरित्यागी भक्तिमान्यः स मे प्रियः ॥ १२-१७॥

A person who neither rejoices in mundane pleasures nor despairs in worldly sorrows, who neither laments for any loss nor hankers for any gain, who renounces both good and evil deeds, such a persons who is full of devotion is very dear to Me.

समः शत्रौ च मित्रे च तथा मानापमानयोः ।
शीतोष्णसुखदुःखेषु समः सङ्गविवर्जितः ॥ १२-१८॥
samaH shatrau cha mitre cha tathA mAnApamAnayoH 
shItoShNasukhaduHkheShu samaH sangavivarjitaH  12.18

A person who is equanimous to friend and foe, equipoised in honor and dishonor, cold and heat, joy and sorrow, and is free from all worldy entanglement;

तुल्यनिन्दास्तुतिर्मौनी सन्तुष्टो येन केनचित् ।
अनिकेतः स्थिरमतिर्भक्तिमान्मे प्रियो नरः ॥ १२-१९॥
tulyanindAstutirmaunI santuShTo yena kenachit 
aniketaH sthiramatirbhaktimAnme priyo naraH  12.19

Such a person, who takes praise and reproach alike, who is given to silent contemplation, content with what comes ones way, who is not bound by any identities, whose intellect is firmly fixed in Me, and who is full of devotion to Me, such a person, is very dear to Me.

ये तु धर्म्यामृतमिदं यथोक्तं पर्युपासते ।
श्रद्दधाना मत्परमा भक्तास्तेऽतीव मे प्रियाः ॥ १२-२०॥
ye tu dharmyAmRtamidaM yathoktaM paryupAsate 
shraddadhAnA matparamA bhaktAsteatIva me priyAH  12.20

Those who continuously meditate upon this nectar like dharma, as it is mentioned here, with devoted focus towards Me, such devotees are the dearest to Me!

ॐ तत्सदिति श्रीमद्भगवद्गीतासूपनिषत्सु

AUM tatsaditi shrImadbhagavadgItAsUpaniShatsu
