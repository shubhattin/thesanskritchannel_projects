  Now begins the ninth sarga, named “Deliberation on the Means to Send Rama into
  Exile,” in the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. (2-9)
'1': >-
  Thus addressed, Kaikeyī—her face aflame with wrath—heaved a long, hot sigh,
  and spoke these words to Mantharā. (2-9-1)
'2': >-
  “This very day I shall quickly send Rāma from here to the forest; and this
  very day I shall swiftly consecrate Bharata with the office of heir-apparent
  and kingship.” (2-9-2)
'3': >-
  “But now consider this: by what means may I accomplish it—so that Bharata may
  obtain the kingdom, and Rāma, in no manner whatsoever, may obtain it?” (2-9-3)
'4': >-
  Thus spoken to by the queen, Mantharā—evil-sighted, intent on injuring Rāma’s
  cause—said this to Kaikeyī. (2-9-4)
'5': >-
  “Come now, Kaikeyī—look and listen to my words—how your son Bharata alone
  shall obtain the kingdom.” (2-9-5)
'6': >-
  “Do you not remember, Kaikeyī—or, remembering, do you conceal it—what you once
  wished to hear from me, spoken for your own advantage?” (2-9-6)
'7': >-
  “If you desire, O sportive lady, to hear what I say, then listen: I shall tell
  it; and having heard it, let it be carried out accordingly.” (2-9-7)
'8': >-
  Hearing those words of Mantharā, Kaikeyī rose a little from her well-spread
  couch and said this. (2-9-8)
'9': >-
  “Tell me the means, Mantharā—by what device shall Bharata obtain the kingdom,
  and Rāma not obtain it in any way?” (2-9-9)
'10': >-
  Thus spoken to by the queen, Mantharā—evil-sighted, bent on harming Rāma’s
  interest—spoke again to Kaikeyī. (2-9-10)
'11': >-
  “Formerly, in the war between the Devas and the Asuras, your lord went forth
  together with royal seers, taking you along, to render aid to the king of the
  gods.” (2-9-11)
'12': >-
  “Setting out, O Kaikeyī, toward the southern quarter, toward the Daṇḍaka
  forests, there was a city renowned as Vaijayanta, where Timidhvaja dwelt.”
  (2-9-12)
'13': >-
  “There the great Asura, famed as Śambara, possessing a hundred magical powers,
  gave battle to Śakra and remained unconquered by the hosts of gods.” (2-9-13)
'14': >-
  “In that great war, at night, when men lay asleep, the Rakṣasas would swiftly
  slay those who were wounded and mangled.” (2-9-14)
'15': >-
  “There, then, King Daśaratha, the mighty-armed, waged a great battle with the
  Asuras, and was cut to pieces by their weapons.” (2-9-15)
'16': >-
  “Bearing him away from the battlefield when he had lost consciousness, O
  queen, you protected your husband—though even there he was pierced and wounded
  by weapons.” (2-9-16)
'17': >-
  “Pleased by that, he granted you two boons, O auspicious-looking lady; and
  your husband said, ‘Choose whatever boon you desire, O queen, at that time.’”
  (2-9-17)
'18': >-
  “‘I shall take them later, O husband,’—so was it spoken by you then, and thus
  was assented to by that great-souled king; for I myself did not know it then,
  O queen—you told me of it formerly.” (2-9-18)
'19': >-
  “This matter, out of affection for you, I keep in my mind: restrain and turn
  back the preparations being made for Rāma’s consecration.” (2-9-19)
'20': >-
  “And then ask your husband for those two boons: the consecration of Bharata,
  and the banishment of Rāma for fourteen years.” (2-9-20)
'21': >-
  “For when Rāma has been exiled to the forest for fourteen years, the people’s
  love will settle upon Bharata, and your son will become firmly established.”
  (2-9-21)
'22': >-
  “Enter this very day the chamber of wrath, O daughter of Aśvapati, as if
  angry; lie down upon the ground, clad in soiled garments, on a bed that is
  hidden away.” (2-9-22)
'23': >-
  “Do not look toward him, and do not speak to him—seeing the king, weep, eager
  for sorrow before the eyes of the world.” (2-9-23)
'24': >-
  “You are always dear to your husband—of this I have no doubt; and for your
  sake the great king would even enter the fire.” (2-9-24)
'25': >-
  “He is not able to make you angry, nor to look upon you when angry; for the
  sake of what is pleasing to you, the king would even abandon his
  life-breaths.” (2-9-25)
'26': >-
  “Indeed the lord of the earth is not able to transgress your word. O woman of
  dull disposition, understand the power of your own good fortune.” (2-9-26)
'27': >-
  “King Daśaratha may offer you pearls, gems, gold, and various jewels—do not
  set your mind upon those.” (2-9-27)
'28': >-
  “Those two boons which Daśaratha granted in the war of Devas and Asuras—remind
  him of them, O greatly fortunate lady; that purpose will not slip away from
  you.” (2-9-28)
'29': >-
  “And when the king himself, the Rāghava, rises and would grant you the boon,
  having put the great king in proper readiness, choose this boon.” (2-9-29)
'30': >-
  “Let Rāma’s banishment be far away—for nine years and five besides (that is,
  fourteen); and let Bharata be made king upon the earth, O bull among kings.”
  (2-9-30)
'31': >-
  “For when Rāma has been exiled to the forest for fourteen years, your son will
  have taken root, become firmly grounded, and will remain so thereafter.”
  (2-9-31)
'32': >-
  “Therefore, O queen, ask him for that boon—Rāma’s banishment. Thus will all
  your desires regarding your son be fulfilled, O woman of desire.” (2-9-32)
'33': >-
  “Thus exiled, Rāma will become ‘without delight’ (a-rāma); and Bharata, freed
  from enemies, will become your king.” (2-9-33)
'34': >-
  “By the time Rāma returns from the forest, your son will be firmly rooted,
  both within and without (in palace and kingdom).” (2-9-34)
'35': >-
  “Strong in himself and supported by friends with men gathered around him—I
  deem the time has come; approach the king without fear.” (2-9-35)
'36': >-
  “Restrain and turn back the resolve for Rāma’s consecration.” Thus was she
  then led by that counsel, which made calamity appear in the guise of
  advantage. (2-9-36)
'37': >-
  Delighted and convinced, Kaikeyī said this to Mantharā; for, by the words of
  the hunchback, she went astray like a young girl misled onto a wrong path.
  (2-9-37)
'38': >-
  Kaikeyī, exceedingly fair to behold, filled with great astonishment, said: “I
  do not disdain your intelligence, O best of women, who speak what is most
  excellent.” (2-9-38)
'39': >-
  “Among hunchbacks on earth you are the foremost in firmness of counsel; and in
  my affairs you alone are ever devoted, a well-wisher.” (2-9-39)
'40': >-
  “O hunchback, I could never have understood the king’s intention. There are
  hunchbacks ill-set, crooked, and exceedingly wicked—” (2-9-40)
'41': >-
  “—but you, lovely to behold, are bent like a lotus by the wind. Your chest is
  full and prominent, rising up to the shoulders.” (2-9-41)
'42': >-
  “Below, your belly is calm and comely, like a modest navel; your hips are
  well-filled, and your breasts are full and rounded.” (2-9-42)
'43': >-
  “Your face is like the spotless moon—ah, Mantharā, you shine like a queen!
  Your hips are smooth, adorned with the sound of the girdle-belt.” (2-9-43)
'44': >-
  “Your shanks are set very well, and both your feet are broad and
  well-stretched; O Mantharā, clothed in fine linen, with thighs long and
  shapely.” (2-9-44)
'45': >-
  “Going before me, you shine exceedingly. The magical powers that were with
  Śambara, lord of Asuras—there were a thousand of them—” (2-9-45)
'46': >-
  “—those are lodged in your heart, and again countless others besides. That
  very thing—your hidden and bent back-part—which is long and extended like the
  pole of a chariot.” (2-9-46)
'47': >-
  “Counsels, the lore of kṣatriyas, and magical arts dwell in you here. Here, O
  hunchback, I shall bestow upon you a golden garland.” (2-9-47)
'48': >-
  “When Bharata has been consecrated and Rāghava has gone to the forest—O fair
  one—(I shall give) pure gold, beautifully heated and refined.” (2-9-48)
'49': >-
  “Having attained my aim and being fully satisfied, I shall anoint your back;
  and upon your face a splendid, auspicious tilaka made of gold.” (2-9-49)
'50': >-
  “I shall have made for you, O hunchback, auspicious ornaments as well; wearing
  fine garments, you shall move about like a goddess.” (2-9-50)
'51': >-
  “With a face incomparable, as if calling the moon itself, you shall attain the
  foremost station, making the hostile folk proud and envious.” (2-9-51)
'52': >-
  “Even your own hunchbacks—women like you—adorned with all ornaments, shall
  attend upon your feet, just as you ever attend upon me.” (2-9-52)
'53': >-
  Thus praised, Mantharā said this to Kaikeyī, who lay upon her splendid bed
  like a flame of fire upon an altar. (2-9-53)
'54': >-
  “A bridge-building after the water has already passed is not accomplished, O
  auspicious lady. Rise; do what is beneficial; go and meet the king.” (2-9-54)
'55': >-
  Thus encouraged, the large-eyed queen—intoxicated and arrogant with the pride
  of her good fortune—went with Mantharā into the chamber of wrath. (2-9-55)
'56': >-
  That noble lady cast off a pearl necklace worth many hundreds of thousands,
  and also her excellent, auspicious ornaments worthy of the best.” (2-9-56)
'57': >-
  Then Kaikeyī, golden-hued, having come under the sway of the hunchback’s
  words, lay down upon the ground and said this to Mantharā. (2-9-57)
'58': >-
  “Either you shall report me to the king here as dead, O hunchback—or, when
  Rāghava has gone to the forest, Bharata shall obtain the earth.” (2-9-58)
'59': >-
  “I have no need of gold, nor of jewels, nor of foods. This is the end of my
  life, if Rāma is consecrated.” (2-9-59)
'60': >-
  Thereupon the hunchback spoke to that chief queen, the mother of Bharata, with
  words of great force and urgency—speaking what was ‘for her good’ while
  approaching what was harmful to Rāma. (2-9-60)
'61': >-
  “If Rāghava obtains this kingdom, then surely you and your son will suffer.
  Therefore, O auspicious lady, strive in such a way that your son Bharata may
  be consecrated.” (2-9-61)
'62': >-
  Thus pierced, that chief queen—struck again and again by the hunchback with
  arrows of speech—placed her hands upon her heart in utter amazement, and
  repeatedly denounced the hunchback in anger. (2-9-62)
'63': >-
  “Either, O hunchback, hearing that I have gone hence into the realm of Yama,
  you will report it— or, when Rāghava has gone to the forest for a long time,
  Bharata will become one whose desires are fulfilled.” (2-9-63)
'64': >-
  “For I desire neither beds nor garlands, neither sandal paste nor collyrium,
  neither drink nor food. I desire nothing at all, nor even life here, unless
  Rāghava goes from here to the forest.” (2-9-64)
'65': >-
  Then, having spoken words exceedingly harsh, that fair lady laid aside all her
  ornaments, and lay down upon the unadorned earth without a spread, like a
  celestial minstrel-maiden fallen down. (2-9-65)
'66': >-
  Her face veiled by the darkness of rising passion, having cast off her finest
  garlands and adornments, that wife of the king became downcast—like the sky
  shrouded in gloom, with its stars sunk from sight. (2-9-66)
'67': >-
  Thus ends the ninth sarga, named “Deliberation on the Means to Send Rama into
  Exile,” in the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval
  epic. (2-9)
