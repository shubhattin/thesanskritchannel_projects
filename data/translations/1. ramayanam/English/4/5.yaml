  Now begins the Fifth Sarga, named “Sugrīva’s Friendship (with Rāma),” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then Hanumān, having gone from Ṛṣyamūka to that Malaya mountain, reported to
  the lord of the Vānaras (Sugrīva) about those two heroes, the Rāghavas.
'2': >-
  “This is Rāma—of great wisdom—who has arrived here, firm in prowess. Along
  with his brother Lakṣmaṇa, this Rāma is truly of unfailing valour.”
'3': >-
  “Born in the lineage of the Ikṣvākus, Rāma is the son of Daśaratha—steadfast
  in dharma, and one who carries out his father’s command.”
'4': >-
  “By him the sacred fire was well satisfied through Rājasūya and Aśvamedha
  sacrifices; and abundant gifts were bestowed—cows by the hundreds of
  thousands.”
'5': >-
  “By austerity and by truthfulness of speech the earth was protected by him;
  yet, for a woman’s sake, this very son of his—Rāma—has come into the forest.”
'6': >-
  “While this great-souled one dwells in the forest, restrained and observant of
  rule, his wife has been carried off by Rāvaṇa; therefore he has come to you
  seeking refuge.”
'7': >-
  “These two brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, desire friendship with you. Therefore,
  receive them with honour and worship them—both are most worthy of reverence.”
'8': >-
  Hearing Hanumān’s words, Sugrīva, lord of the Vānaras, becoming most gracious
  to behold, spoke to Rāghava with delight:
'9': >-
  “You are disciplined by dharma, of great austerity, and compassionate to all.
  The son of the Wind has truly described to me, in accordance with reality,
  your virtues.”
'10': >-
  “Therefore this very honour is mine, and it is the highest gain, O lord—that
  you desire friendship with me, a Vānara.”
'11': >-
  “If friendship with me is pleasing to you, here is my arm extended. Let hand
  be taken by hand, and let a firm covenant be established.”
'12': >-
  Hearing this well-spoken statement of Sugrīva, Rāma, with a greatly delighted
  mind, pressed his hand with his own.
'13': >-
  Rejoicing, and holding fast to that bond of affection, he embraced him
  closely. Then Hanumān—foe-subduer—casting off the guise of a mendicant,
'14': >-
  produced fire by his own power from two pieces of wood; and then, the blazing
  fire was duly honoured and revered with flowers.
'15': >-
  Between the two of them, well-pleased and with mind composed, he placed it.
  Then those two, with the fire shining bright, circumambulated it.
'16': >-
  Thus Sugrīva and Rāghava entered into friendship; and thereafter those
  two—Hari (the Vānara) and Rāghava—were of hearts exceedingly glad.
'17': >-
  Gazing upon one another, they did not attain satiety (from looking). “You are
  my dear friend; our sorrow and our happiness are one and the same.”
'18': >-
  Thus spoke Sugrīva to Rāghava, in words full of joy. Then, breaking off a
  many-leaved branch, laden with blossoms,
'19': >-
  Sugrīva spread it upon the ground and sat down with Rāghava. Then Hanumān, son
  of the Wind, in great delight,
'20': >-
  gave Lakṣmaṇa a branch of a sandalwood tree, richly covered with blossoms.
  Thereupon Sugrīva, rejoicing, in gentle and sweet speech,
'21': >-
  replied to Rāma, his eyes trembling with happiness: “I have been wronged, O
  Rāma; I wander here, tormented by fear.”
'22': >-
  “My wife has been taken; frightened in the forest, I have taken refuge in this
  difficult region. Thus, terrified and afraid in the woods, I live with a mind
  bewildered.”
'23': >-
  “Deceived by Vāli—my own brother—and having enmity made, O Rāghava: O noble
  one, grant safety to me who am distressed by fear of Vāli.”
'24': >-
  “O Kakutstha, you ought to act in such a way that fear may not remain for me.”
  Thus addressed, the radiant one—knower of dharma and devoted to dharma—
'25': >-
  the Kakutstha answered Sugrīva, as though smiling: “The fruit of kindness to a
  friend is known to me, O great monkey.”
'26': >-
  “I shall slay that Vāli, the abductor of your wife. Unfailing are these my
  sharp arrows, brilliant like the sun.”
'27': >-
  “Upon that wicked Vāli they shall fall with speed—covered with feathers like
  those of the heron, and resembling Indra’s thunderbolt.”
'28': >-
  “With keen points and straight joints, like enraged serpents—behold today that
  Vāli, struck by my arrows, like sharp venomous snakes,”},{
'29': >-
  “felled upon the earth, scattered like a mountain.” Hearing that speech of
  Rāghava, beneficial to himself, Sugrīva, supremely delighted, spoke this
  highest utterance:
'30': >-
  “By your grace, O heroic man-lion, I shall obtain both my beloved and my
  kingdom. Therefore do you act, O king among men, so that that enemy may not
  again harm my elder brother.”
'31': >-
  In the occasion of affection between Sugrīva and Rāma, the left eyes of Sītā,
  the lord of the monkeys, and the night-ranging rākṣasas throb together—eyes
  resembling the lotus, gold, and blazing fire.
'32': >-
  Thus ends the Fifth Sarga, named “Sugrīva’s Friendship,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
