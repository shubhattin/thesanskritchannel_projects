  Now begins the fifth sarga of Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the blessed Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  entitled “The Ordinance of Vow and Religious Observance (for the rite).”
'1': >-
  Having instructed Rāma regarding the consecration that was to take place on
  the morrow, the king summoned the family priest Vasiṣṭha and spoke these words
  to him:
'2': >-
  “Go, O scion of penance, and have Kākutstha (Rāma) observe a fast today,
  together with his bride (Sītā), keeping his vow restrained—for his welfare and
  for the gaining of the kingdom.”
'3': >-
  Saying, “So be it,” to the king, that blessed Vasiṣṭha—foremost among those
  who know the Vedas—went himself to Rāma’s dwelling.
'4': >-
  To cause the heroic Rāma—knower of mantras and skilled in the lore of sacred
  formulas—to undertake the fast, Vasiṣṭha, firm in his own observances, mounted
  an excellent chariot, befitting a brāhmaṇa, well-yoked and well-appointed.
'5': >-
  Reaching Rāma’s mansion, which shone like a mass of pale clouds, the best of
  sages entered—still in his chariot—through three successive courts
  (enclosures).
'6': >-
  Seeing the ṛṣi arrive, Rāma, as though in haste and with reverent eagerness,
  stepped out from his residence, intending to honor the venerable one who was
  worthy of honor.
'7': >-
  Approaching quickly to the side of the wise one’s chariot, Rāma himself took
  hold and helped him to descend from the chariot.
'8': >-
  Seeing Rāma standing with humility, and having addressed him and graciously
  gladdened him—Rāma who deserved what is dear—the family priest spoke these
  words:
'9': >-
  “Your father is pleased with you, O Rāma, because you shall obtain the
  kingdom. Let your highness observe a fast today together with Sītā.”
'10': >-
  “For tomorrow the lord of men—your father Daśaratha—will, in gladness,
  consecrate you to the office of Yuvarāja, even as Nahusha consecrated Yayāti.”
'11': >-
  Having thus spoken, that self-restrained and pure Vasiṣṭha then caused
  Rāma—together with Vaidehī (Sītā)—to undertake the fast, duly and in
  accordance with mantra and rite.
'12': >-
  Then, having been honored as was fitting by Rāma, the guru of the king took
  leave of Kākutstha and departed from Rāma’s residence.
'13': >-
  Rāma too, seated there among his friends—those sweet of speech—after being
  greeted and honored, then entered within, having duly taken leave of them all.
'14': >-
  At that time Rāma’s house, filled with joyful women and men, shone forth like
  a lake of blossoming lotuses crowded with flocks of intoxicated birds.
'15': >-
  Setting out from that renowned royal mansion, from Rāma’s residence, Vasiṣṭha
  beheld the roadway thronged with people.
'16': >-
  In Ayodhyā, the royal roads on every side became choked again and again by
  groups upon groups of people, surrounded by crowds eager with curiosity.
'17': >-
  Then the great sound of the royal road—covered with the mingled clash and
  rejoicing cry of the multitudes—resembled the roar of the ocean.
'18': >-
  That day Ayodhyā had its streets sprinkled and well-swept; it was garlanded
  like a forest of flowers, and its houses had banners raised aloft.
'19': >-
  For then the people dwelling in Ayodhyā—thronged with women and
  children—longed for Rāma’s consecration and, longing for it, yearned for the
  sunrise.
'20': >-
  Eager to behold that festival of Ayodhyā—an adornment to the subjects and an
  increaser of the people’s joy—the populace became filled with उत्सुकता (keen
  anticipation).
'21': >-
  Thus, as the royal road was so densely packed with people, the family priest,
  as though arranging and parting that flood of men, proceeded slowly to the
  king’s palace.
'22': >-
  Ascending the palace that looked like a peak of white clouds, he approached
  the lord of men, like Bṛhaspati approaching Indra.
'23': >-
  Seeing him arrive, the king abandoned his royal seat and asked his intention;
  and Vasiṣṭha informed him that it had been done (the prescribed fast and
  observance duly arranged).
'24': >-
  The members of the assembly, seated there and equal in propriety to him, rose
  up from their seats, honoring and revering the family priest.
'25': >-
  Permitted by the guru, the king dismissed that multitude of men and entered
  the inner apartments, like a lion entering a mountain cave.
'26': >-
  And the monarch entered that splendid residence—like the palace of
  Mahendra—crowded with women in choice apparel; illuminating it with his
  presence, as the moon lights up the sky filled with hosts of stars.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the fifth sarga, entitled “The Ordinance of Vow and Religious
  Observance,” in Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
