  Now begins, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the
  forty-second canto, called “The Recreation of Rāma and Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Then mighty-armed Rāma, having dismissed that Puṣpaka car adorned with gold,
  entered at that time the Aśoka-grove.
'2': >-
  It was beautified on every side with sandal and aguru, with lofty kāleyaka
  trees, and also with forests of deva-dāru.
'3': >-
  It was adorned with campaka, aśoka, pun-nāga, madhūka, and panasa trees, and
  with pārijāta trees, glowing like smokeless flame.
'4': >-
  It was covered over with thickets and a net of creepers—lodhra, nīpa, arjuna,
  nāga, saptaparṇa, and atimukta, with mandāra, plantain, shrubs, and entwining
  vines.
'5': >-
  It was further adorned with priyangu, kadamba, and also vakula trees, with
  jambū and pomegranate as well, and with kovidāra trees.
'6': >-
  Ever charming with lovely blossoms, delightful with fruit-bearing
  trees—endowed with celestial fragrance and taste—rich with tender sprouts and
  fresh shoots.
'7': >-
  And likewise with divine trees, as though fashioned by skilled
  artisans—abounding in beautiful new leaves and flowers—thronged with
  intoxicated bees.
'8': >-
  It was beautified with cuckoos, with bṛṅga-rāja birds, and with birds of many
  colors—variegated in hundreds of ways—having mango trees as its ornaments, as
  it were.
'9': >-
  There the trees shone in diverse hues: some like refined gold, some like the
  cresting flame of fire, and others like dark blue collyrium.
'10': >-
  There were fragrant flowers and garlands of many kinds; and there were tanks
  of varied forms, filled with water of the finest quality.
'11': >-
  Their steps were made of rubies, their inner pavements of crystal; they were
  groves of fully-blown lotuses and blue water-lilies, and were graced by pairs
  of cakravāka birds.
'12': >-
  Resounding with dātyūha birds and flocks of parrots, and echoing with the
  cries of swans and sārasas; their banks were beautified by trees laden with
  blossoms.
'13': >-
  They were adorned with enclosures of various forms and with stone platforms;
  and in that very woodland region (they gleamed) as if made of vaidūrya gems.
'14': >-
  That grove, supremely endowed with green turf, was a forest of flowering
  trees; and there, from the mutual rubbing together of blossoming trees,
'15': >-
  the stone slabs were mottled with fallen flowers, like the hosts of stars in
  the sky. Like Indra’s Nandana-grove, and like Brahmā’s Caitraratha, such
  indeed was Rāma’s woodland residence.
'16': >-
  Entering that vast Aśoka-grove, furnished with many dwelling-halls and
  surrounded by vine-arbors, Raghu’s delight (Rāma) went within.
'17': >-
  And on a seat of auspicious form, adorned with heaps of flowers, spread with a
  covering of kuśa grass, Rāma sat down.
'18': >-
  Taking Sītā by the hand, the son of Kakutstha gave her to drink pure
  honey-liquor, even as Purandara (Indra) gives to Śacī.
'19': >-
  Well-prepared meats and fruits of many kinds—his attendants quickly brought
  them for Rāma’s eating.
'20': >-
  And women—maidens skilled in dance and song—danced before the king; youthful
  and beautiful, they moved in accordance with the sway of drink.
'21': >-
  Those Rāma-loving women, delightful in their minds, Rāma—best of those who
  gladden—ever adorned, the righteous-souled, continually delighted.
'22': >-
  Seated with that Sītā at his side, he shone forth, like Vasiṣṭha in splendor
  seated together with Arundhatī.
'23': >-
  Thus Rāma, joined with joy, day after day delighted Vaidehī, who was like the
  daughter of the gods, even as a god would.
'24': >-
  And as Sītā and Rāghava long sported thus, auspicious time passed on—the
  winter season, ever a giver of enjoyments, went by.
'25': >-
  Ten thousand years passed for those two great-souled ones; having attained
  divers pleasures, the coming of winter had elapsed.
'26': >-
  In the forenoon, the knower of dharma, having by righteousness performed the
  duties of dharma, spent the remaining half portion of the day within the inner
  apartments.
'27': >-
  Sītā too, having performed the forenoon rites and the divine duties, offered
  worship to all her mothers-in-law, without distinction.
'28': >-
  Then she approached Rāma, wearing wondrous ornaments and garments, like Śacī
  approaching the thousand-eyed one seated in heaven.
'29': >-
  But when Rāghava saw his wife endowed with auspicious beauty, he attained
  incomparable delight and said, “Well done! well done!”
'30': >-
  And he spoke to Sītā of fair hips, like the daughter of the gods: “Vaidehī,
  for me, the obtaining of offspring has come to be present through you.”
'31': >-
  “What do you desire, O fair-hipped lady? What is your wish? What shall be done
  for you?”
'32': >-
  Then Vaidehī, smiling, spoke to Rāma: “O Rāghava, I wish to behold the holy
  forests of asceticism.”
'33': >-
  “O lord, I wish to dwell at the feet of sages of fierce splendor who sit upon
  the bank of the Gaṅgā, who live on fruits and roots.”
'34': >-
  “This is my highest desire—that among those who subsist on roots and fruits, O
  Kakutstha, I might dwell in a forest of austerity even for a single night.”
'35': >-
  “So be it,” was promised by Rāma of unwearied deeds: “Be at ease, O Vaidehī;
  tomorrow you shall go, without doubt.”
'36': >-
  Having spoken thus to Maithilī, Janaka’s daughter, Kakutstha Rāma, surrounded
  by his friends, went out into an inner chamber.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the forty-second canto, called “The Recreation of Rāma and Sītā,” in
  the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, composed in
  the tradition of the Ṛṣis.
