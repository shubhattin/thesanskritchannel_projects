  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the fourteenth
  canto, called “The Battle of the Yakṣas and the Rākṣasas.”
'1': >-
  Then that illustrious one, accompanied by six ministers—ever arrogant in their
  strength—namely Mahodara and Prahasta, and Mārīca, Śuka, and Sāraṇa, set
  forth.
'2': >-
  And with the heroic Dhūmrākṣa as well—ever greedy for battle—he proceeded, as
  though in wrath he were burning up the worlds.
'3': >-
  Passing in but a short while beyond cities, and rivers, and mountains, and
  forests and groves, he reached Mount Kailāsa.
'4': >-
  Hearing that the lord of the Rākṣasas had taken position upon that
  mountain—wicked-souled, attended by his counsellors, and exceedingly eager for
  battle—
'5': >-
  the Yakṣas were not able to stand before the face of that Rākṣasa; and knowing
  him to be the king’s brother, they went to where the Lord of Wealth
  (Dhanēśvara) was.
'6': >-
  Having gone, they reported in full what that brother intended to do; and,
  granted permission by Dhanada (Kubera), they departed joyfully for battle.
'7': >-
  Thereupon a great commotion of armies arose, like unto the heaving of the
  mighty ocean— as though shaking the mountain of that lord of the Naiṛrtas
  (Rākṣasas).
'8': >-
  Then a battle came to pass, crowded with Yakṣas and Rākṣasas; and there the
  ministers of the Rākṣasa were greatly distressed.
'9': >-
  Seeing such an army, Daśagrīva, the night-ranger, raising many cries of
  exultation, rushed forward in wrath.
'10': >-
  But those ministers of the lord of the Rākṣasas, of dreadful prowess—each one
  of them fought with a thousand Yakṣas.
'11': >-
  Then Daśagrīva, though being struck with clubs and mallets, with swords and
  spears and javelins, plunged into that host.
'12': >-
  There Daśānana, as he was being slain (assailed) on every side, stood as
  though bereft of breath; like with rain-laden clouds he was hemmed in by
  torrents (of weapons).
'13': >-
  Yet he did not feel distress, though smitten by the Yakṣas’ weapons—like a
  mountain, drenched by clouds with hundreds of streams of rain.
'14': >-
  That wicked-souled one, lifting a mace like unto the rod of Death, entered
  then into the army, slaying Yakṣas without diminution.
'15': >-
  As fire driven by the wind burns a wide-spread thicket—like dry fuel piled in
  abundance—so did he burn that Yakṣa host.
'16': >-
  And by those great ministers there—Mahodara, Śuka, and the rest—those Yakṣas
  were left with but a small remnant, like clouds scattered by the winds.
'17': >-
  Some, struck down and shattered, fell upon the field of battle; and, enraged
  in the fight, they bit their lips with their sharp teeth.
'18': >-
  Others, weaponless in the battlefield, weary, embracing one another, then sank
  down—like banks (that give way) under the onrush of water.
'19': >-
  Of those being slain and going to heaven, and of those fighting upon the
  earth, while hosts of Ṛṣis looked on—there was no interval in the sky (it was
  filled without gap).
'20': >-
  But seeing those mighty Yakṣa-lords broken, the mighty-armed treasurer
  (Kubera), the overseer of wealth, sent forth Yakṣas (reinforcements).
'21': >-
  In that very interval, O Rāma, there fell upon the battlefield a Yakṣa of vast
  forces and vehicles, sent (by Kubera), named Saṃyodhakaṇṭaka.
'22': >-
  By his discus Mārīca was slain in battle, as if by Viṣṇu; and he fell upon the
  earth like a planet whose merit is exhausted, fallen from a mountain.
'23': >-
  Regaining consciousness after a short while, that night-ranger, having rested,
  again fought with that Yakṣa; but the Yakṣa, broken, fled away.
'24': >-
  Then he (the Rākṣasa) entered the gateway—golden, adorned with varied designs,
  dusted over with the pollen-like gleam of vaidūrya (cat’s-eye gem)—the inner
  space of the arch that marked the boundary of the gatekeepers.
'25': >-
  But as that night-ranger Daśagrīva was entering, O king, the door-guardian
  famed as Sūryabhānu barred him.
'26': >-
  Though being restrained by the Yakṣa, the night-ranger forced his way in; and
  when checked, O Rāma, that Rākṣasa did not stand back.
'27': >-
  Then, striking down that Yakṣa, he tore up the gateway-arch; and bleeding, he
  shone like a mountain streaming with mineral ores.
'28': >-
  Smitten by that gateway-arch which resembled a mountain-peak, the hero
  suffered no injury—by virtue of the boon granted by Svayambhū (Brahmā).
'29': >-
  But the Yakṣa, struck hard by him with that very arch, was then no longer
  seen—his body then reduced to ashes.
'30': >-
  Thereupon all the Yakṣas fled on seeing the Rākṣasa’s might; then, tormented
  by fear, they entered rivers and caves—casting away their weapons, exhausted,
  their faces pale then.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the fourteenth canto, named “The Battle of the Yakṣas and the
  Rākṣasas,” in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
