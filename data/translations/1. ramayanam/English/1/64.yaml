  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, begins the sixty-fourth
  canto, entitled “The Curse of Rambhā.”
'1': >-
  “O Rambhā, a mighty task of the gods must be accomplished by you—here, you are
  to entice Kauśika (Viśvāmitra), one who is associated with the delusion born
  of desire and infatuation.”
'2': >-
  Thus addressed by the wise Thousand-eyed one (Indra), that apsarā, O Rāma,
  abashed and with joined palms, replied to the Lord of the gods.
'3': >-
  “O Lord of the gods, this Viśvāmitra is a dreadful great sage; he will surely
  unleash a terrible wrath upon me—of this, O Deva, there is no doubt.”
'4': >-
  “Therefore, O Deva, fear has seized me; you ought to show me favor and grant
  me protection.” Thus spoken by her then—timid and afraid, O Rāma—
'5': >-
  the Thousand-eyed one said to her, as she trembled with folded hands: “Fear
  not, Rambhā; auspiciousness be to you. Do my command.”
'6': >-
  “On a lovely tree in springtime, a cuckoo—charming and heart-stealing—shall
  sing; and I, together with Kandarpa (the god of love), will stand at your
  side.”
'7': >-
  “Assume a form of surpassing radiance, rich with many excellences; and, O fair
  one, unsettle and break the austerity of that ascetic sage Kauśika.”
'8': >-
  Hearing his words, she assumed an incomparable form; graceful and with a pure
  smile, she began to allure Viśvāmitra.
'9': >-
  And he heard the sweet sound of the cuckoo as it warbled; his mind became
  exceedingly delighted, and he kept gazing upon her.
'10': >-
  Then, by that sound and by the peerless song, and also by the sight of Rambhā,
  the sage was seized with doubt (his mind wavering from his vow).
'11': >-
  Understanding that all this was the work of the Thousand-eyed one, the
  foremost of sages—Kauśika’s son—became filled with wrath and cursed Rambhā.
'12': >-
  “Since you seek to entice me, Rambhā—me who strives to conquer desire and
  anger—ten thousand years shall you remain, O unfortunate one, as a rock.”
'13': >-
  “A brāhmaṇa of very great splendor, endowed with the power of austerity, shall
  deliver you, O Rambhā, from this curse—though you have been tainted by my
  wrath.”
'14': >-
  Having thus spoken, the great and mighty sage Viśvāmitra, unable to restrain
  the anger and burning anguish within himself, stood overwhelmed.
'15': >-
  By that mighty curse, Rambhā at once became a stone. And hearing the words of
  the great seer, Kandarpa too withdrew and departed from that place.
'16': >-
  And, O Rāma, that great and mighty one—his austerity having been thwarted and
  robbed through anger, and his senses not yet fully conquered—did not obtain
  peace within himself.
'17': >-
  In him there arose constant reflection and anxiety, for his austerity had been
  disturbed: “Never again shall I fall into such anger, nor shall I ever speak
  thus in any manner.”
'18': >-
  “Or else, I shall not even draw breath—for hundreds of years. I shall dry up
  my own body, having subdued my senses.”
'19': >-
  “Until such time as I attain brāhmaṇahood won by austerity, I shall stand for
  everlasting years—without breathing and without eating.”
'20': >-
  “For, while I am performing austerities, my embodied forms shall not waste
  away.” Thus did that foremost of sages undertake, O Delighter of the Raghus,
  an incomparable initiation (vow) in the world for a thousand years, and made a
  solemn resolve.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fourth canto, called “The Curse of Rambhā,” in the
  Bāla-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
