  Now begins the twenty-first sarga of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Rāvaṇa Made as Worthless as a Blade of Grass.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that speech of the fierce and cruel rākṣasa, Sītā—afflicted—answered
  him then, slowly, in a feeble and piteous voice.
'2': >-
  Sītā, tortured by sorrow, weeping, trembling, that ascetic lady of pure
  conduct—lofty-browed—kept thinking only of her husband, for she was devoted to
  her husband alone.
'3': >-
  Placing a blade of grass between them, the pure-smiling one replied: “Turn
  your mind away from me; let your mind take delight in your own people (and
  your own proper sphere).”
'4': >-
  “It is not right for you to seek me—like a sinner seeking a holy attainment. I
  must not do what ought not to be done; for one who has but one husband, such
  conduct is censured.”
'5': >-
  Having thus spoken, that illustrious daughter of Videha—who had come from a
  noble and meritorious lineage, born in a great family—addressed Rāvaṇa.
'6': >-
  Turning her back upon Rāvaṇa, she again spoke these words: “I am not a fitting
  wife for you; I am another man’s wife, a faithful and chaste woman.”
'7': >-
  “Look well to dharma; practice a truly good vow and righteous conduct. As your
  own wives are to be protected by you, so too are the wives of others to be
  protected, O night-ranging one.”
'8': >-
  “Taking yourself as the measure, let a man delight in his own wives. But other
  men’s wives bring to ruin one whose senses are fickle, who is not content with
  his own wives, and whose understanding is trained in deceit.”
'9': >-
  “Whether the righteous exist here or do not exist, you do not follow the
  righteous. For your understanding is perverted, and devoid of right conduct.”
'10': >-
  “Your speech is false, and your mind is wrongly guided; you do not accept the
  wholesome counsel spoken by the wise—for the very destruction of the rākṣasas
  (you persist in such ways).”
'11': >-
  “When a king of uncontrolled self, devoted to unrighteousness, is encountered,
  prosperous kingdoms and even cities come to ruin.”
'12': >-
  “In the same way, having you as its lord, Laṅkā—crowded with heaps of
  jewels—will, through the offence of you alone, perish before long.”
'13': >-
  “When a long-sighted man like you is being struck down by his own deeds, the
  beings rejoice at the destruction of one whose actions are sinful.”
'14': >-
  “Thus will deluded people speak of you, the doer of evil deeds, rejoicing:
  ‘How fortunate! That fierce one has met with calamity.’”
'15': >-
  “I cannot be enticed by sovereignty or by wealth. I belong to Rāghava alone,
  as radiance belongs to the Sun.”
'16': >-
  “Having rested upon the honored arm of that Lord of the world, how could I
  ever rest upon the arm of any other man whatsoever?”
'17': >-
  “I am the rightful wife of that very lord of the earth—like sacred knowledge
  belonging to a twice-born brāhmaṇa who has bathed after his vows, who is
  self-controlled and truly known (as a man of realization).”
'18': >-
  “Do well, O Rāvaṇa—restore me, the sorrowing one, to Rāma, as an elephant-cow
  that has dwelt in the forest is brought back to the lord of elephants.”
'19': >-
  “Rāma, seeking to secure his rightful place, and not wishing to forge a
  dreadful enmity, O best of men, will make with you a friendship that is
  fitting.”
'20': >-
  “He is famed as the knower of all dharma, and compassionate to those who seek
  refuge. Therefore let friendship with him be yours—if you desire to live.”
'21': >-
  “Seek to please him, that lover of those who take refuge; and you, being
  self-restrained, ought to send me forth to him.”
'22': >-
  “For thus there will be welfare for you—if you deliver me to the best of the
  Raghu line. Otherwise, doing the contrary, you will surely come to supreme
  calamity.”
'23': >-
  “One may avoid a thunderbolt that has been hurled; one may avoid Death for a
  long time; but when that Lord of the world, Rāghava, is enraged, one cannot
  avoid him—least of all a man like you.”
'24': >-
  “You will hear the great roar of Rāma’s bow—like the crash of Indra’s
  thunderbolt, released by the lord of a hundred sacrifices.”
'25': >-
  “Here, swiftly, his arrows—well-jointed, with blazing mouths like
  serpents—those arrows aimed by Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—will fall.”
'26': >-
  “Slaying the rākṣasas in this city, without doubt, they will make them fall
  helplessly, like vultures falling upon the ground.”
'27': >-
  “That mighty Rāma—like Garuḍa—will swiftly pluck up the great serpents that
  are the rākṣasa-lords, as Vainateya (Garuḍa) plucks up serpents.”
'28': >-
  “My husband, the subduer of foes, will quickly take me away from you—just as
  Viṣṇu, by three strides, took away the blazing fortune from the asuras.”
'29': >-
  “In Janasthāna—where the rākṣasa host was slain, at that place of
  slaughter—this was done by you, O rākṣasa, while you were powerless; indeed it
  was not at all proper.”
'30': >-
  “Entering the hermitage of those two lion-like men when it was empty—when the
  brothers had gone out to the range of the deer—you, wretch, carried me away.”
'31': >-
  “For you—having merely caught the scent of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—cannot stand firm
  in their very sight, like a jackal before two tigers.”
'32': >-
  “In combat with those two, your seizing of them would not endure—just as Vṛtra
  could not endure when grappling with the arms of Indra, even in the struggle
  of a single arm.”
'33': >-
  “Swiftly my lord Rāma, together with Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), will take away your
  life with his arrows—like the Sun drinking up a little water.”
'34': >-
  “Whether you have gone to Kubera’s mountain, or to the abode and assembly-hall
  of King Varuṇa, without doubt you will be delivered (into the power) of
  Dāśarathi—like a great tree struck down by Time with a thunderbolt.”
'35': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-first sarga of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the first among epics, entitled “Rāvaṇa Made as Worthless as a Blade
  of Grass.”
