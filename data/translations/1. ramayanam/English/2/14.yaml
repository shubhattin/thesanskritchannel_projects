  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the fourteenth
  chapter, entitled “Kaikeyī’s Reproach (Upālambha).”
'1': >-
  Seeing the king of the Ikṣvāku line—stricken by grief for his son, that sinful
  woman—lying senseless upon the ground, fallen down and trembling in his
  helpless agitation, spoke these words.
'2': >-
  Why is it that, as though you had committed some sin, you lie thus on the bare
  earth after hearing my words? It befits you to stand firm in your station; you
  ought not to sink down upon the ground.
'3': >-
  Those who know dharma declare that truth indeed is the supreme dharma. Taking
  refuge in truth, I have urged you toward dharma.
'4': >-
  Having given his own body to the hawk, King Śaibya, lord of the earth,
  attained the highest state.
'5': >-
  So too the radiant King Alarka, when a brāhmaṇa well-versed in the Vedas
  begged him for his eyes, plucked out his own eyes and gave them—though his
  mind was pained.
'6': >-
  The lord of rivers as well—though he has only a small boundary—abides in
  truth; constrained by his pledge to truth, at the appointed time he does not
  overstep his own shore.
'7': >-
  Truth is Brahman in a single word; in truth dharma is established. The Vedas
  are imperishable because of truth; by truth the highest goal is attained.
'8': >-
  Follow truth unfailingly, if your mind is fixed in dharma. Let that boon
  granted by you to me be fulfilled—for you are a giver of boons, O best of the
  virtuous.
'9': >-
  For the sake of dharma alone, and because I myself have pressed you, banish
  your son Rāma; three times indeed I say this to you.
'10': >-
  And if you will not carry out this righteous agreement of mine, then,
  abandoned before your very eyes, I shall renounce my life.
'11': >-
  Thus urged by Kaikeyī without any hesitation, the king was unable to loosen
  that noose—like Bali bound by Indra.
'12': >-
  His heart too became bewildered, and his face turned pale; he quivered like a
  strong draft-ox that trembles between the yoke and the wheels.
'13': >-
  With both eyes failing, as though he did not see the earth at all, the lord of
  the land with great difficulty gathered his courage, and then said this to
  Kaikeyī:
'14': >-
  I renounce that hand of yours, taken by me in marriage, which I—sinful as I
  am—held beside the sacred fire; and I renounce my own son as well, and your
  son together with you.
'15': >-
  The night has passed, O queen, and the sun’s rising draws near. The people
  will surely hurry me on for the consecration.
'16': >-
  With all the preparations for Rāma’s consecration already arranged for that
  purpose, Rāma will have to perform the water-rites for me when I am dead.
'17': >-
  By you, together with your son, no water-rites shall be performed for me—if
  you bring to completion this consecration of Rāma, you whose conduct is evil.
'18': >-
  I am not able today to face that people again, having earlier seen their faces
  so—joy extinguished, delight gone—once more with their faces cast down.
'19': >-
  While that great-souled king was speaking thus, the sacred night ended, bright
  with the moon and a garland of stars.
'20': >-
  Then Kaikeyī, whose conduct was sinful, again spoke harsh words to the
  king—she who understood speech well, yet was overwhelmed by anger:
'21': >-
  Why do you speak such words, O king—words like a sickness caused by poison?
  You should promptly have Rāma, your son, brought here without distress.
'22': >-
  Having established my son in the kingdom, and having made Rāma a dweller in
  the forest, and having rendered me free of rivals, you will have achieved your
  purpose.
'23': >-
  Thus pressed again and again by Kaikeyī, the king—like a noble horse goaded
  with a sharp prod—spoke these words:
'24': >-
  I am bound by the bond of dharma, and my understanding has fled. I wish to see
  my eldest son, dear Rāma, righteous in conduct.
'25': >-
  Then, when the night had ended and the sun had risen, and when the auspicious
  conjunction with the sacred constellation had arrived, and the proper muhūrta
  had come,
'26': >-
  Vasiṣṭha, endowed with every excellence, surrounded by his disciples, quickly
  taking up the preparations, entered the foremost of cities (Ayodhyā).
'27': >-
  Its streets were sprinkled and swept; it was adorned with splendid banners; it
  was filled with rejoicing people along with their younger folk, and it
  abounded with rich markets and shops.
'28': >-
  It was joined to a great festival, eager for Rāghava’s sake, and everywhere
  perfumed and smoked with sandal, agaru, and incense.
'29': >-
  Passing through that city, like the city of Purandara (Indra), the illustrious
  sage beheld the inner palace adorned with many clusters of standards.
'30': >-
  Crowded with townsmen and countryfolk, beautified by brāhmaṇas, fully
  furnished with staffs (for ceremonial use), and honored with excellent,
  well-bred horses,
'31': >-
  Having reached that inner palace, Vasiṣṭha—exceedingly pleased—moved through
  the throng, attended by the foremost of sages.
'32': >-
  There he saw Sumantra, the charioteer, having come out and standing at the
  doorway of the lion among men (the king), a minister pleasing to behold.
'33': >-
  To that wise son of a sūta, Vasiṣṭha of great splendor said: “Quickly announce
  that I have come here to the king.”
'34': >-
  “These golden jars filled with Gaṅgā-water, and (waters) from the seas; the
  auspicious seat of udumbara wood—all have been brought for the consecration.
'35': >-
  All kinds of seeds and fragrances, and diverse jewels; honey, curds, ghee,
  parched grains; darbha-grass; flowers; milk—(all are ready).”
'36': >-
  “Eight lovely maidens; and an intoxicated, excellent elephant; a splendid
  chariot with four horses; a sword; and a supreme bow—(all are prepared).”
'37': >-
  “A vehicle fitted for men; a moon-white royal parasol; two white yak-tail
  fans; and a golden pitcher—(all are arranged).”
'38': >-
  “A pale bull with a hump, bound with garlands of gold; and a lion,
  four-fanged, the best of beasts, of great strength—(these too are present).”
'39': >-
  “A throne-seat; a tiger-skin; sacred fuel-sticks; the fire for offerings; all
  the assemblies of musicians; and courtesans—women adorned—(are assembled).”
'40': >-
  “Teachers; brāhmaṇas; cows; and auspicious deer and birds; the foremost of
  townsmen and countryfolk; and merchant guilds with their groups—(all stand
  ready).”
'41': >-
  “These and many others besides—delighted and sweet-speaking—stand together
  with the king, for the consecration of Rāma.”
'42': >-
  “Hasten the great king, so that when the day has risen, in the auspicious
  conjunction with the constellation Puṣya, Rāma may attain the kingdom.”
'43': >-
  Hearing his words, the mighty son of a sūta, praising the tiger among kings,
  entered the royal residence.
'44': >-
  Those stationed at the door—approved by the king—could not stop that aged sage
  of whom mention had already been made, for they desired to do what would
  please the king.
'45': >-
  Coming near the king, Sumantra recognized his condition, and began to praise
  him with words meant to give the highest satisfaction.
'46': >-
  Then, as before, in the king’s dwelling, Sumantra, with joined palms, praised
  the lord of the earth.
'47': >-
  “As the radiant ocean rejoices at the rising of the Sun, so do you, with a
  mind pleased, gladden us today.”
'48': >-
  “At this very time, Mātali praised Indra, and Indra conquered all the Dānavas;
  in the same way I now rouse you.”
'49': >-
  “As the Vedas with their limbs and the sciences today awaken Brahmā, the
  self-born Lord, so do I awaken you.”
'50': >-
  “As the Sun along with the Moon today awakens the fair earth that bears all
  beings, so do I awaken you.”
'51': >-
  “Arise, O great king, with auspicious rites and solemn gladness
  accomplished—shining in your body like the Sun upon Mount Meru.”
'52': >-
  “May Soma and Sūrya, O scion of Kakutstha; and Śiva and Vaiśravaṇa; and Varuṇa
  and Agni and Indra grant you victory.”
'53': >-
  “The blessed night has passed; what was to be done on your part has been done.
  Awake, O tiger among kings, and perform what must be done next.”
'54': >-
  “All of Rāma’s consecration is ready in full; the townsmen and countryfolk,
  and the merchant guilds too, stand with joined palms.”
'55': >-
  “The venerable Vasiṣṭha himself stands with the brāhmaṇas. Command swiftly, O
  king, that Rāghava’s consecration be carried out.”
'56': >-
  “For as cattle without a herdsman, as an army without a leader, as night
  without the moon, as cows without a bull—”
'57': >-
  “—so indeed will the realm become where the king is not seen.” Hearing his
  words, which were meaningful as though with gentle reassurance,
'58': >-
  the lord of the earth was once again overwhelmed and scattered with grief.
  Then the king, without joy in the matter of his son,
'59': >-
  with eyes reddened by sorrow, looked up and spoke righteously: “With your
  words you pierce my vital parts again and again.”
'60': >-
  Sumantra, hearing that pitiable speech and seeing the king despondent, with
  joined palms withdrew a little from that place.
'61': >-
  When the lord of the earth, from misery, was himself unable to speak, then
  Kaikeyī—skilled in counsel—answered Sumantra:
'62': >-
  “Sumantra, the king—eager with delight for Rāma, yet exhausted from keeping
  vigil through the night—has fallen under the sway of sleep.”
'63': >-
  “Therefore go quickly, O charioteer; bring here the illustrious prince Rāma.
  May good be yours; there is no need for deliberation in this matter.”
'64': >-
  (Sumantra said:) “Without hearing the king’s command, how can I go, O
  passionate queen?” Hearing the minister’s words, the king said to the
  minister:
'65': >-
  “Sumantra, I wish to see Rāma. Quickly bring that noble one.” Thinking it to
  be for good, Sumantra rejoiced in his heart.
'66': >-
  And glad at the king’s command, he went out swiftly. Yet Sumantra reflected,
  being urged in haste by her:
'67': >-
  “Surely the righteous ruler (Rāma) is coming here for the purpose of
  consecration.” Having thus resolved in his mind, the charioteer, again with
  great joy,
'68': >-
  the mighty one, went out eager to see Rāghava. Leaving the auspicious inner
  palace, resembling the ocean or a lake, and passing through the crowded press
  of people, Sumantra saw the great gateway before him.
'69': >-
  Then, suddenly emerging in front, scanning those who stood at the king’s gate,
  he saw various townsmen—very wealthy—who had come up and were stationed at the
  doorway, waiting.
'70': >-
  Thus ends the fourteenth chapter, entitled “Kaikeyī’s Reproach,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the ancient poem, the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
