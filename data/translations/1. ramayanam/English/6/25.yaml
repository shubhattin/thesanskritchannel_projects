  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the
  twenty-fifth sarga, called “The Dispatch of Śuka and Sāraṇa (and related
  matters).”
'1': >-
  When Rāma, the son of Daśaratha, had crossed the ocean together with his
  entire host, the glorious Rāvaṇa spoke to Śuka and Sāraṇa, his two
  counsellors.
'2': >-
  “The whole ocean has been crossed by the vānaras—an army difficult to pass
  beyond; and by Rāma has been accomplished, upon the sea, a causeway-building
  such as was never seen before.”
'3': >-
  “I could never, in any manner, have believed that a bridge could be bound
  across the sea; yet that entire vānarahost must certainly be counted by me.”
'4': >-
  “You two, entering the vānaras’ army unrecognized, must ascertain its measure
  and its might, and also which are the foremost leaders among the plavaṅgamas.”
'5': >-
  “And also those who are Rāma’s ministers, and those approved by Sugrīva; those
  who advance in the forefront, and the plavaṅgamas who are heroes.”
'6': >-
  “And how that bridge has been constructed in the sea, in that ocean of waters;
  and how the great-souled vānaras have made their encampment.”
'7': >-
  “And you should learn in truth Rāma’s resolve, his prowess, and his weapons;
  and likewise of the heroic Lakṣmaṇa.”
'8': >-
  “And who is the commander of those great-souled vānaras—having known that also
  correctly, you must return quickly.”
'9': >-
  Thus instructed in detail, the two rākṣasas—Śuka and Sāraṇa—valiant warriors
  assuming the form of monkeys, entered the vānaras’ army.
'10': >-
  Then those two, Śuka and Sāraṇa, were unable to count that inconceivable
  vānaras’ host, which was hair-raising to behold.
'11': >-
  They saw it stationed upon mountain-peaks, at waterfalls, and in caves; and
  along the shores of the sea; in forests and in groves; everywhere—crossing,
  having crossed, and desiring to cross.
'12': >-
  They saw that mighty force—now encamping and now settling—uttering dreadful
  roars: an ocean of strength that could not be shaken.
'13': >-
  Vibhīṣaṇa of great splendour saw those two, concealed; and seizing Śuka and
  Sāraṇa, he reported them to Rāma.
'14': >-
  “These two are the counsellors of the lord of rākṣasas—Śuka and Sāraṇa—spies
  who have come from Laṅkā, O conqueror of enemy-citadels.”
'15': >-
  Seeing Rāma, distressed and bereft of hope for their lives, they—fearful, with
  palms joined in reverence—spoke these words.
'16': >-
  “We both have come here, O gentle one, sent by Rāvaṇa—to learn the entire
  strength of the army. This is that, O delight of the Raghu-line.”
'17': >-
  Hearing their words, Rāma, Daśaratha’s son—ever devoted to the welfare of all
  beings—spoke with a smile.
'18': >-
  “If the entire army has been seen, and if we also have been observed with
  steady attention; and if the task has been done as commanded—then return as
  you wish.”
'19': >-
  “Or if something has not been seen, you may again look upon it further; or
  Vibhīṣaṇa will show you everything once more in full.”
'20': >-
  “And having been captured thus, you should not fear for your life: with
  weapons laid aside, though seized, messengers do not deserve to be slain.”
'21': >-
  “Release these two concealed spies, both rākṣasas who roam by night—who
  constantly draw Vibhīṣaṇa away toward the enemy’s side.”
'22': >-
  “Entering the great city of Laṅkā, you must speak to the king of rākṣasas—the
  younger brother of the Lord of Wealth (Kubera)—exactly this message of mine.”
'23': >-
  “The strength on which you relied when you carried away my Sītā—display that,
  as you please, together with your army and with your kinsmen.”
'24': >-
  “Tomorrow morning, behold the city of Laṅkā—with its ramparts and its
  gateways—and the force of the rākṣasas, shattered by my arrows.”
'25': >-
  “I shall unleash terrible wrath upon you together with your army, O
  Rāvaṇa—tomorrow morning, as Vāsava, wielder of the thunderbolt, hurls the
  thunderbolt upon the dānavas.”
'26': >-
  Thus instructed in detail, the two rākṣasas—Śuka and Sāraṇa—saluted that
  Rāghava, beloved of dharma, saying, “Victory!”
'27': >-
  Reaching the city of Laṅkā, they spoke to the lord of rākṣasas: “Vibhīṣaṇa
  seized us for the sake of our execution, O sovereign of rākṣasas.”
'28': >-
  “But we were released by Rāma of boundless splendour, the righteous-souled;
  and there we saw gathered together in one place four foremost among men.”
'29': >-
  “Heroes like the guardians of the worlds—masters of weapons, firm in valour:
  Rāma the son of Daśaratha, the illustrious Lakṣmaṇa, and Vibhīṣaṇa.”
'30': >-
  “And Sugrīva of great radiance, equal in prowess to Mahendra (Indra). These
  are able to uproot the city of Laṅkā—with its ramparts and its gateways—and
  carry it away; and all the vānaras stand ready.”
'31': “Such indeed is Rāma’s form, and such are his weapons.”
'32': >-
  “He will destroy the city of Laṅkā single-handed; let those three remain
  standing. Protected by Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, and with Sugrīva and the vānaras as
  its host, that army became still more unassailable—even to all the gods and
  asuras.”
'33': >-
  “The army of the great-souled forest-dwellers is delighted in battle, and at
  this moment wishes to fight. Enough of enmity—let peace be made; let Maithilī
  be given back to Daśaratha’s son.”
'34': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fifth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Dispatch of Śuka
  and Sāraṇa (and related matters).”
