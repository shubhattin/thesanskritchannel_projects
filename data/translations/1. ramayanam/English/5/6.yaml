  Now begins the sixth sarga of the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Inspection of Rāvaṇa’s Palace.”
'1': >-
  That monkey, assuming forms at will, roamed at his full pleasure among the
  aerial chariots, and moved about Laṅkā with ease and agility.
'2': >-
  And the fortunate one came upon the dwelling of the lord of rākṣasas,
  encompassed by a radiant rampart, resplendent and of the hue of the rising
  sun.
'3': >-
  Guarded by formidable rākṣasas like a great forest protected by lions, the
  mighty elephant among monkeys beheld that mansion and shone forth as he
  surveyed it.
'4': >-
  It was surrounded by wondrous gateways inlaid with silver, adorned with golden
  ornaments, and by many variegated courtyards and charming doors.
'5': >-
  It was attended by great ministers stationed upon elephants, and by heroes
  free from fatigue; and it was furnished with invincible horses yoked to
  chariots.
'6': >-
  It was ever traversed by resounding, variegated chariots, fitted with armor of
  lion and tiger hides, and decorated with teeth of ivory and with gold and
  silver.
'7': >-
  It was strewn with many jewels, adorned with exceedingly precious seats, a
  gathering-place of great charioteers, and a grand hall for great charioteers.
'8': >-
  All around it was filled on every side with many thousands of most excellent
  creatures—beasts and birds of diverse kinds—delightful to behold.
'9': >-
  It was securely guarded by disciplined warders within and by rākṣasas; and on
  every side it was filled with foremost and excellent women.
'10': >-
  That dwelling of the lord of rākṣasas, rich with the jewel-like throng of
  delighted women, rang like the ocean with the clamor of splendid ornaments.
'11': >-
  Endowed with the qualities of a king, and fragrant with chief and excellent
  sandalwoods, it was crowded with multitudes, like a great forest thronged with
  lions.
'12': >-
  It resounded with the sounds of kettle-drums and mṛdaṅgas, and was made
  tumultuous by conch-blasts; it was continually worshipped, honored at
  festivals, and ever revered by the rākṣasas.
'13': >-
  Deep as the ocean and sounding like the ocean, it was the vast mansion of that
  great-souled one, furnished with the appurtenances of great jewels.
'14': >-
  That great monkey beheld it—filled with great gems, radiant in its splendor,
  and crowded with elephants, horses, and chariots.
'15': >-
  “This indeed is the very ornament of Laṅkā,” thought the great monkey; and
  Hanumān ranged there, near to Rāvaṇa.
'16': >-
  Beholding the houses of the rākṣasas one after another, and their gardens
  everywhere, the undaunted one also moved about among the mansions.
'17': >-
  Leaping with great speed, the mighty one came upon Prahasta’s residence; then,
  valorous as he was, he sprang to the palace of Mahāpārśva.
'18': >-
  Then the great monkey leapt to the dwelling of Kumbhakarṇa, resembling a
  cloud, and likewise to that of Vibhīṣaṇa.
'19': >-
  And so too to the houses of Mahodara and of Virūpākṣa; and to the mansion of
  Vidyujjihva, and likewise of Vidyunmālī.
'20': >-
  And the great monkey leapt also to the house of Vajradaṁṣṭra; and, swift of
  pace, to that of Śuka and to that of the wise Sāraṇa.
'21': >-
  In the same manner the leader of the monkey-host went to the palace of
  Indrajit; and the best of monkeys went to those of Jambumālī and Sumāli as
  well.
'22': >-
  And the great monkey leapt to the house of Raśmikeṭu, and likewise of
  Sūryaśatru; and also to that of Vajrakāya.
'23': >-
  Then Māruti (the son of the Wind-god) went to the house of Dhūmrākṣa, and of
  Sampāti; and of the terrible Vidyudrūpa, of Ghana, and of Vighana.
'24': >-
  And to the residences of Śukanābha, Cakra, Śaṭha, and Kapaṭa; and of
  Hrasvakarṇa, Daṁṣṭra, and the rākṣasa Lomaśa.
'25': >-
  And of Yuddhonmatta, of Matta, of Dhvajagrīva, of Sādin; and of the
  two—Vidyujjihva and Dvijihva—as well as of Hastimukha.
'26': >-
  And of Karāla the piśāca, and also of Śoṇitākṣa—thus, leaping in due order,
  Hanumān, the son of the Wind-god, ranged on.
'27': >-
  Among those many costly mansions, the great and illustrious one beheld, in
  each case, the prosperity of those affluent rākṣasas.
'28': >-
  Having passed around all their dwellings on every side, the fortunate one at
  last came again upon the residence of the lord of rākṣasas.
'29': >-
  The foremost of monkeys saw the rākṣasī women sleeping in Rāvaṇa’s abode, as
  that tiger among monkeys moved about, observing their deformed and dreadful
  eyes.
'30': >-
  He saw, in the house of that lord of rākṣasas, various companies of
  guards—some holding tridents and maces, others bearing spears and javelins.
'31': >-
  And he saw gigantic rākṣasas, ready with weapons of many kinds—some red, some
  white, some pale, and some tawny—possessed of great speed.
'32': >-
  He saw noble elephants, handsome in form, that shattered enemy
  elephants—trained in the discipline of elephant-war, and in battle like
  Airāvata himself.
'33': >-
  Those slayers of hostile armies he beheld within that house—pouring forth like
  clouds shedding rain, and streaming on like mountains from which waters flow.
'34': >-
  Terrible, with a roar like thunder from clouds, hard for foes to assail in
  battle—there were a thousand troops there, richly caparisoned with gold of
  Jāmbūnada.
'35': >-
  Unbroken with networks of gold, resembling the youthful sun, he beheld them in
  the palace of Rāvaṇa, the lord of rākṣasas.
'36': >-
  That monkey, the son of the Wind-god, saw palanquins of various shapes, and
  charming vine-entwined pleasure-houses, and buildings with painted halls.
'37': >-
  And he saw other sporting-houses, and structures like wooden mountains; and a
  delightful “House of Kāma,” and also a “Day-house.”
'38': >-
  In the residence of Rāvaṇa, the lord of rākṣasas, he beheld a mansion like
  Mount Mandara, filled with places for peacocks.
'39': >-
  He saw that best of buildings crowded with flagstaffs, having an endless store
  of jewels, with nets of treasure on every side—steady in its ordered
  functions, like the abode of the Lord of Beings (Śiva).
'40': >-
  And by the flames (radiance) of the gems and by Rāvaṇa’s own splendor, that
  palace shone—abounding in rays, as though with rays upon rays.
'41': >-
  The leader of the monkey-host saw couches and seats made of Jāmbūnada-gold,
  and bright, auspicious vessels as well.
'42': >-
  Moistened with honey and fermented drink, crowded with jewel-vessels,
  delightful and spacious, it was like the mansion of Kubera.
'43': >-
  It was made clamorous by the tinkling of anklets and the sound of girdles, and
  resounded with the booming strokes of mṛdaṅga drums.
'44': >-
  Joined to clusters of lofty mansions, thronged with hundreds of jewel-like
  women, and furnished with well-arranged inner apartments, Hanumān entered that
  great palace.
'45': >-
  Thus ends the sixth sarga of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the venerable, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Inspection of
  Rāvaṇa’s Palace.”
