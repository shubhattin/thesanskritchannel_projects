  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, the sixth sarga,
  called “The Battle with Viṣṇu and Mālyavān and the rest.”
'1': >-
  When the gods and the ascetics rich in austerity were being harassed and slain
  by them, they—afflicted with fear—went for refuge to the God of gods,
  Maheśvara.
'2': >-
  (They approached) Him who is the creator, sustainer, and ender of the worlds;
  the Unborn One whose form is unmanifest; the support of all the worlds; the
  Supreme Guru, worthy to be worshipped.
'3': >-
  Having come together to the foe of Kāma, the destroyer of Tripura, the
  Three-eyed Lord, the gods said, with joined palms, their words faltering with
  fear:
'4': >-
  “O Blessed Lord, O Overseer of creatures—by the sons of Sukeśa, made arrogant
  by the boon of the Grandfather (Brahmā), all our subjects are being
  oppressed—those enemies, afflicters of foes.”
'5': >-
  “Even the hermitages—refuges for the refuge-less—have been laid waste by them;
  and having cast the gods down from heaven, they sport in heaven as though they
  themselves were gods.”
'6': >-
  “(They proclaim,) ‘I am Viṣṇu; I am Rudra; I am Brahmā; I am the lord of the
  gods.
'7': >-
  I am Yama and Varuṇa; I am the Moon; I am also the Sun!’ Thus do the
  rākṣasas—Mālī, Sumālī, and Mālyavān—and those who go before them, exulting in
  battle, oppress us. Therefore, for us gods who are tormented by fear, you
  ought to grant fearlessness.”
'8': Assuming a terrible, inauspicious form, slay indeed those thorns to the gods!
'9': >-
  (“They oppress us, exulting in battle, and those who go before them…”) Thus
  addressed by all the gods, Kapardī, the blue-and-red-hued Lord, the Supreme
  One, speaking with regard to Sukeśa, said to the hosts of gods:
'10': >-
  “I shall not slay them. For to me they are not to be slain, O gods. But I
  shall give you a sacred counsel (mantra/means) by which they will indeed be
  slain.”
'11': >-
  “Keeping this very resolve in the forefront, O great ṛṣis, go and take refuge
  in Viṣṇu. That Lord will slay them.”
'12': >-
  Then, acclaiming Maheśvara with cries of victory, they—tormented by fear of
  the night-rangers—went to the presence of Viṣṇu.
'13': >-
  Having bowed to the God who bears conch and discus, and having honored Him
  greatly, they spoke in agitated words concerning the sons of Sukeśa:
'14': >-
  “O God, by the three sons of Sukeśa—blazing like the fires of the Tretā
  age—our abodes have been seized by force, made proud by the power of a boon.”
'15': >-
  “The fortress-city named Laṅkā stands upon the peak of Trikūṭa. Dwelling
  there, the rākṣasas oppress all of us at every moment.”
'16': >-
  “Therefore, for our welfare, slay them, O Madhusūdana. We have come to you for
  refuge; be our sole refuge and goal, O Lord of the gods.”
'17': >-
  “With your discus, cut down the lotus-like faces (heads) (of those foes) and
  consign them to Yama. In terrors, you are our giver of fearlessness; apart
  from you, there is no other (protector) for us.”
'18': >-
  “Drive away from us the fear, O God, by slaying in battle those wicked
  rākṣasas—puffed up with intoxication—together with their followers, even as
  the sun dispels the mist.”
'19': >-
  Thus addressed by the deities, Janārdana, the God of gods—He who gives fear to
  enemies—granting fearlessness, spoke to the gods:
'20': >-
  “I know the rākṣasa Sukeśa, puffed up by the boon of Īśāna (Śiva). I also know
  his sons, of whom the eldest is Mālyavān.”
'21': >-
  “Those vile rākṣasas who have overstepped all bounds—enraged, I shall slay
  them. O gods, be free from feverish fear.”
'22': >-
  Thus addressed by Viṣṇu, the mighty Lord, all the gods returned to their
  respective abodes, delighted, praising Janārdana.
'23': >-
  But the night-ranger Mālyavān, having heard of the gods’ preparations, spoke
  these words to those two heroic brothers (Mālī and Sumālī):
'24': >-
  “The immortals and the ṛṣis, having assembled—so it is said—(and) having
  approached Śakra (Indra), desiring our destruction, spoke these words:
'25': >-
  ‘O God, the sons of Sukeśa, made arrogant by the strength of their boon, proud
  and of dreadful forms, oppress us at every step.
'26': >-
  We are overcome by the rākṣasas, O Lord of creatures; and out of fear of those
  evil-souled ones, we are unable to remain established in our own dwellings.
'27': >-
  Therefore, for our welfare, slay those rākṣasas, O Three-eyed One. By a mere
  roar (huṅkāra) burn them—O best among burners!’”
'28': >-
  Thus spoken to by the thrice-ten gods, Andhakasūdana (Śiva), having heard
  (their plea), shaking his head and hand, spoke these words:
'29': >-
  “In battle, the sons of Sukeśa are not to be slain by me, O gods. But I shall
  give you a means (mantra) which will indeed slay them.”
'30': >-
  “That Janārdana—Hari, glorious Nārāyaṇa—clad in yellow garments, holding
  discus and mace in his hands: take refuge in Him.”
'31': >-
  Having obtained the counsel from Hara, and having paid homage to the foe of
  Kāma, they reached Nārāyaṇa’s abode and reported everything to Him.
'32': >-
  Then Nārāyaṇa spoke to the gods, with Indra at their head: “I shall slay those
  enemies of the gods. O gods, be free from fear and distress.”
'33': >-
  “Since Hari has promised us the death of those two bulls among rākṣasas for
  the gods who are terrified with fear, let it be considered what is fitting to
  do here.”
'34': >-
  “The death of Hiraṇyakaśipu, and of other haters of the gods—Namuçi, Kālanemi,
  and Saṁhrāda, the best of heroes;”
'35': >-
  “Rādheya (Kārṇa), the wielder of many illusions; and Lokapāla, the righteous
  one; and the twin Arjunas of the Yamala (trees); Hārdikya; and Śumbha and
  Niśumbha;”
'36': >-
  “Asuras and Dānavas too—endowed with prowess and great strength—all, having
  encountered Him in battle, are not heard of as having remained unconquered.”
'37': >-
  “All have performed sacrifices by hundreds of rites; all are likewise knowers
  of māyā; all are skilled in every weapon; all are terrifying to foes.
'38': >-
  Yet by Nārāyaṇa they have been slain—by hundreds and by thousands. Knowing
  this, you all ought to do here what is appropriate.”
'39': >-
  Then Sumālī and Mālī, having heard Mālyavān’s words, spoke to their eldest
  brother as (men might speak) to Vāsava (Indra), who is as a portion of good
  fortune:
'40': >-
  “We have mastered what should be learned; we have given gifts; we have
  performed sacrifices; sovereignty has been well maintained; we have attained
  life free from disease; and we have been set upon the path of good conduct.”
'41': >-
  “Plunging into the unagitated ocean of the gods, unshaken (by any), and wading
  through it with weapons, we have conquered incomparable foes—yet for us, this
  is a fear that brings death.”
'42': >-
  “Nārāyaṇa and Rudra, Śakra too, and Yama likewise—before us all of them always
  stand in fear.”
'43': >-
  “There is, indeed, no true cause on the part of Viṣṇu, O lord of rākṣasas;
  rather, by the fault of the gods alone has Viṣṇu’s mind been stirred against
  us.”
'44': >-
  “Therefore, today, fully prepared and surrounded by all our armies, let us
  seek to slay the gods themselves—this blame has arisen from them.”
'45': >-
  Thus, having deliberated, all those mighty ones, encompassed by their armies,
  proclaiming their march, all the chiefs of the rākṣasas went forth in wrath to
  war—like the forces of Jambha and Vṛtra.
'46': >-
  Thus, O Rāma, having taken counsel with complete readiness, all those
  rākṣasas—huge of body and great in strength—went forth to battle.
'47': >-
  With chariots; with elephants; with horses like mountains; with asses, with
  cattle, with camels and chariot-camels; with porpoises and serpents;
'48': >-
  with makaras, tortoises, and fishes; with birds like Garuḍa; with lions,
  tigers, and boars; with antelopes and even yaks (camara-bearing beasts);
'49': >-
  abandoning Laṅkā, all those rākṣasas—proud of their might—set out for the
  world of the gods to fight, being enemies of the deities.
'50': >-
  Seeing the overturning (desertion) of Laṅkā, the beings that dwelt in
  Laṅkā—beholding fearful omens—became downcast everywhere.
'51': Mounting excellent chariots—by hundreds and by thousands—
'52': >-
  the rākṣasas swiftly and with effort advanced toward the world of the gods;
  and by the very path of the rākṣasas, the deities retreated.
'53': >-
  Portents—terrestrial and celestial—fearsome, as though commanded by Time,
  arose for the destruction of the rākṣasa lords.
'54': >-
  Clouds rained bones, and also hot blood. The seas overstepped their shores,
  and the mountains too trembled.
'55': >-
  Loosing loud peals of laughter, sounding like the rumbling of thunder, there
  cried there she-jackals of dreadful and terrifying appearance.
'56': >-
  Then beings swooped down and were seen in due order; and here there was a
  great circle of vultures, with mouths spewing flame,
'57': >-
  wheeling in the sky above the rākṣasas like a blazing firebrand-wheel. Pigeons
  with red feet, and mynas, fled away; crows cried there; and cats (appeared) as
  though two-footed.
'58': >-
  Disregarding those portents, the rākṣasas—proud of their strength—still went
  on and did not turn back, as though bound fast in the noose of Death.
'59': >-
  And Mālyavān, Sumālī, and Mālī—of very great might—stood as their leaders,
  like fires at the head of sacrifices.
'60': >-
  All those night-rangers took refuge in Mālyavān, firm as a mountain, even as
  the gods (take refuge) in the Creator (Dhātṛ).
'61': >-
  That army of the rākṣasa lords, roaring like a mass of great thunderclouds,
  went to the world of the gods, eager for victory, remaining under Mālī’s sway.
'62': >-
  But the Lord Nārāyaṇa, having heard from a divine messenger of that
  mobilization of the rākṣasas, then set his mind upon war.
'63': >-
  He, with weapons ready and quiver prepared, stood upon Vainateya (Garuḍa),
  having put on divine armor, radiant like a thousand suns.
'64': >-
  Then, having bound on his spotless quivers filled with arrows, and (having
  taken) his shining sword and the belt at his waist, the lotus-eyed Lord (took
  up) his excellent weapons—conch, discus, mace, Śārṅga bow, and the foremost
  sword renowned (among weapons).
'65': >-
  Then the Lord, seated upon Suparṇa—Vainateya—mountain-like, swiftly went forth
  for the destruction of the rākṣasas.
'66': >-
  Upon Suparṇa’s back shone Hari—dark-hued, clad in yellow—like a rain-cloud
  with lightning upon the peak of a golden mountain.
'67': >-
  Sung by Siddhas, gods, ṛṣis, great serpents, Gandharvas, and Yakṣas, the
  Conch-bearing One—wielding discus, sword, and Śārṅga—encountered the enemies’
  (asura) armies.
'68': >-
  That royal army of rākṣasas shook—its banners whirling, its weapons
  scattered—buffeted by the wind from Suparṇa’s wings, like a dark mountain
  whose rocks have been loosened and set in motion.
'69': >-
  Then the night-rangers, surrounding Mādhava, pierced him by thousands with
  excellent weapons and with arrows smeared with blood and flesh, their onset
  like the all-consuming fire at the end of an age.
'70': >-
  Thus ends the sixth sarga in the Uttarakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  Ādikāvya, called “The Battle with Viṣṇu and Mālyavān and the rest.”
