  Now begins the fifteenth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Leaf-hut at Pañcavaṭī.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon, having gone to Pañcavaṭī—abounding in diverse beasts of prey and
  herds of deer—Rāma spoke to his brother Lakṣmaṇa, of radiant and blazing
  splendour:
'2': >-
  “We have arrived at the very region that the sage described and indicated.
  This is the country of Pañcavaṭī—gentle and fair, with its woods in bloom.
'3': >-
  Let your gaze range everywhere through the forest—for you are indeed skilled
  in observing the woodland. In what spot in this land should our hermitage be
  established, as you deem fitting?
'4': >-
  Let such a place be sought, O Lakṣmaṇa, where Vaidehī, you, and I may take
  delight—a tract near at hand to a reservoir of water.
'5': >-
  A place where the beauty of the forest is present, and likewise the beauty of
  water; and where, close by, there may be fuel-sticks, flowers, kuśa-grass, and
  water.
'6': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, with palms joined in reverence, in Sītā’s
  very presence, spoke these words to the Kakutstha:
'7': >-
  “O Kakutstha, I am wholly at your command, were you to remain here even for a
  hundred years. Yet you should yourself choose the pleasing spot; tell me, ‘Let
  it be made here.’”
'8': >-
  Pleased with Lakṣmaṇa’s words, the mighty and resplendent Rāma, after due
  consideration, approved a place endowed with every good quality.
'9': >-
  Advancing upon that lovely tract for the work of establishing the hermitage,
  Rāma took Saumitrī’s hand in his own and spoke to him:
'10': >-
  “This land is level, auspicious, and prosperous, encircled by trees in
  blossom. Here, O gentle one, you should duly make the site of our hermitage.”
'11': >-
  “Not far away is seen a delightful lotus-pond, adorned with lotuses radiant
  like the sun and fragrant with sweet perfume.”
'12': >-
  “As was declared by the sage Agastya of disciplined soul, this is the lovely
  Godāvarī, bordered by trees in bloom.”
'13': >-
  “It is thronged with swans and kāraṇḍava-ducks, and beautified by
  cakravāka-birds; it is neither too far nor too near, and is not crowded by
  herds of deer.”
'14': >-
  “Charming mountains are seen, resonant with peacocks; lofty, with many
  caverns, O gentle one, and covered with trees in full flower.”
'15': >-
  “In various places the mountains, marked with ores of gold, silver, and
  copper, shine as though they were elephants with windows (or openings) on
  their sides, splendid with surpassing grandeur.”
'16': >-
  “They are adorned with śāla and tāla trees, tamāla, date-palms, and jackfruit
  trees; with nīvāra and tiniśa, and with punnāga as well.”
'17': >-
  “They are covered with mango, aśoka, tilaka, ketaka, and also campaka
  trees—together with flowering shrubs and creepers—wrapped in many kinds of
  trees.”
'18': >-
  “With syandana and sandalwood, nīpa and parṇāsa, and also with lakuca; with
  dhava, aśvakarṇa, and khadira; with śamī, kiṁśuka, and pāṭala.”
'19': >-
  “This place is holy; this place is delightful; this place abounds in many deer
  and birds. Here, O Saumitrī, we shall dwell, together with these birds.”
'20': >-
  Thus spoken to by Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa—slayer of hostile heroes—of great might, in a
  short time constructed a hermitage for his brother.
'21': >-
  There he made a broad leaf-hut, well-compacted with clay; with firm supports;
  with long beams and rafters; fashioned with bamboo-work, and exceedingly
  beautiful.
'22': >-
  Spreading out śamī-branches, binding it strongly with stout bonds and
  fastenings, and then well-roofing it over with kuśa, kāśa, śara reeds, and
  leaves.
'23': >-
  That very mighty one levelled the ground and made it a charming dwelling for
  Rāghava’s sake—most excellent and worthy to be beheld.
'24': >-
  Then illustrious Lakṣmaṇa went to the river Godāvarī; having bathed and taken
  lotuses, he returned, successful in his errand.
'25': >-
  Thereafter, having offered a bali of flowers and performed rites of
  appeasement according to rule, he showed Rāma the completed site of the
  hermitage.
'26': >-
  Seeing that lovely hermitage, made and finished, together with Sītā, Rāghava
  felt the highest joy in the leaf-hut.
'27': >-
  Overjoyed, he embraced Lakṣmaṇa with both arms, and then spoke these
  words—exceedingly affectionate and firm:
'28': >-
  “I am greatly pleased with you; this great work has been done by you, O noble
  one. The embrace I have given you is the reward that is due to you for this
  occasion.”
'29': >-
  “O Lakṣmaṇa, knowing my heart, grateful, and knowing dharma—because of you, as
  a son such as this, my righteous-souled father did not become one bereft (of
  true filial support).”
'30': >-
  Having thus spoken to Lakṣmaṇa, Rāghava, increaser of fortune, dwelt happily
  in that region rich in fruits—content and at ease.
'31': >-
  For some time that righteous-souled one, attended upon by Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa,
  lived there—like an immortal in the world of heaven.
'32': >-
  Thus ends the fifteenth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  holy ancient epic, entitled “The Leaf-hut at Pañcavaṭī.”
