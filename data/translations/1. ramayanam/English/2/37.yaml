  Now begins the thirty-seventh sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Vasiṣṭha’s Wrath on the Occasion of the Acceptance
  of Bark-garments.”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of the high ministers, Rāma then addressed Daśaratha with a
  speech; he, who knew humility, spoke as one truly well-disciplined and
  courteous.
'2': >-
  “O king, for me who have abandoned enjoyments and who shall live in the forest
  on forest fare—what purpose is served by a following retinue, when I have
  renounced all attachment on every side?”
'3': >-
  “He who, having gifted away a splendid elephant, yet sets his heart upon its
  girth-belt—what can the affection for a rope matter to him who has already let
  go the foremost of elephants?”
'4': >-
  “So too, O best of the good, what need have I—O lord of the world—of an army
  with standards? I give consent to everything: let them bring to me only the
  bark-garments.”
'5': >-
  “Bring also both the spade and the basket. I shall dwell in the forest for
  fourteen years.”
'6': >-
  Then Kaikeyī herself brought the bark-garments to Rāghava and, in the midst of
  the great throng of people, shamelessly said, “Put these on.”
'7': >-
  That tiger among men accepted those bark-garments from Kaikeyī; casting aside
  his fine cloth, he put on the ascetics’ garments.
'8': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa too, there itself, abandoning his auspicious garments, took up the
  ascetic covering, in the presence of his father.
'9': >-
  Then Sītā, clad in silken cloth, looking at the bark-garment for her own
  wearing, became frightened—like a spotted doe caught in a snare.
'10': >-
  Then Jānakī, of auspicious marks, downcast and as though overcome with shame,
  took up from Kaikeyī those bark-garments made of kuśa and bark.
'11': >-
  With eyes filled with tears—she who knew dharma and beheld dharma clearly—she
  spoke these words to her husband, who resembled the king of the Gandharvas.
'12': >-
  “How indeed do the sages dwelling in the forest fasten on bark-garments?”
  Thus, being unskilled in it, Sītā again and again swooned in bewilderment.
'13': >-
  Taking one bark garment in her hand and trying to place it upon her neck, the
  daughter of Janaka stood there, unskilled, ashamed, and uncertain what to do.
'14': >-
  Seeing this, Rāma—best among upholders of dharma—quickly came near and himself
  fastened the bark-garment on Sītā, over her silk clothing.
'15': >-
  But when the women of the inner apartments saw Rāma fastening that excellent
  bark-garment upon Sītā, they let fall streams of tears from their eyes.
'16': >-
  And wholly overcome, they said to Rāma of blazing splendour: “Child, this
  noble-minded lady ought not to be appointed to a life of forest-dwelling in
  this way.”
'17': >-
  “Since, in obedience to your father’s word, you are going to the lonely
  forest, at least let the sight of her be fruitful for us, O lord, for this
  brief while.”
'18': >-
  “Go to the forest, dear son, with Lakṣmaṇa as your companion. This auspicious
  lady does not deserve to live in the forest like an ascetic.”
'19': >-
  “Grant our entreaty, child: let Sītā, this lovely lady, remain. You, steadfast
  in dharma, would wish to stand by your vow even alone; but she should not go
  now.”
'20': >-
  Hearing such words spoken by them, the son of Daśaratha nevertheless fastened
  on the bark-garment for Sītā, whose conduct and disposition were equal to his
  own.
'21': >-
  When she had taken up the bark-garments, the king’s guru, Vasiṣṭha, with eyes
  full of tears, restrained Sītā and Kaikeyī and spoke these words.
'22': >-
  “O Kaikeyī—most foolish in your overboldness, you disgrace of your
  lineage—having deceived the king, you do not stand upon any rule of right or
  measure.”
'23': >-
  “Sītā shall not go to the forest because of you, O woman devoid of good
  conduct. Sītā will carry out for Rāma the role that is proper to her station.”
'24': >-
  “For to all who live in the state of having taken a wife, the wife is truly
  their very self. Since she is Rāma’s own self, this lady will protect the
  earth.”
'25': >-
  “And if Vaidehī does go to the forest, accompanying Rāma, then we too shall
  follow hereafter, and this city also will depart (with him).”
'26': >-
  “The guards of the inner chambers will go wherever Rāghava goes, together with
  their wives; the realm with its means of livelihood, and the city with all its
  appurtenances, will go as well.”
'27': >-
  “And Bharata, together with Śatrughna—wearing bark-garments and living as a
  forest-dweller—will follow his elder brother, the Kakutstha, dwelling in the
  forest.”
'28': >-
  “Then, when the earth has become empty, gone of its people, along with its
  trees, you alone—evil-conducted woman—will rule it, though set upon the harm
  of the subjects.”
'29': >-
  “For that cannot truly be a kingdom where Rāma is not the king; that forest
  will become the kingdom where Rāma will dwell.”
'30': >-
  “Nor does Bharata wish to rule a land not bestowed by his father—nor, if he
  has been born the son of a king, will he consent to live under you as though
  you were his mother.”
'31': >-
  “Even if you should leap from the earth up into the sky, he—knowing well the
  conduct of the line of his forefathers—will not act otherwise.”
'32': >-
  “Thus you, greedy for your son, have done what is unpleasing to your own son;
  for in the world there is none to be found who is not devoted to following
  Rāma.”
'33': >-
  “Even today, O Kaikeyī, you will see beasts, serpents, wild animals, and
  birds—and even the trees turned toward him—going forth together with Rāma.”
'34': >-
  Then Vasiṣṭha restrained that clothing and said: “O queen, give the best
  ornaments to your daughter-in-law, and remove this bark-garment; bark-garments
  are not to be prescribed for her.”
'35': >-
  “It is Rāma alone whose residence in the forest has been chosen by you, O
  daughter of the king of Kekaya. Let this lady—ever diligent in her daily rites
  and adorned—dwell in the wilderness together with Rāghava.”
'36': >-
  “Let the princess go well provided with excellent vehicles and attendants, and
  with all garments and proper provisions; she was not included by you in the
  granting of the boon.”
'37': >-
  While the foremost of brāhmaṇas—guru of the king, of incomparable power—spoke
  thus, Sītā did not at all turn back in her resolve, desiring to act in return
  for the dear service of her beloved husband.
'38': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-seventh sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa in the
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the sacred, ancient epic, entitled “Vasiṣṭha’s Wrath on the
  Occasion of the Acceptance of Bark-garments.”
