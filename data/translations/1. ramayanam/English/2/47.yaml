  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyākāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-seventh canto called “The Return of the Citizens.”
'1': >-
  But when the night had dawned into morning, those citizens, without Rāghava,
  became bereft of spirit—stricken by sorrow, motionless and powerless, their
  hearts as though broken.
'2': >-
  Worn out by tears born of grief, looking this way and that, they—afflicted
  with misery—saw not even a glimpse of Rāma.
'3': >-
  With faces pained by despair, bereft of that wise one, those pitiable and
  thoughtful people spoke words filled with compassion and lamentation.
'4': >-
  “Fie indeed upon that sleep by which our minds were robbed away! For today we
  do not behold Rāma—broad-chested, mighty-armed.”
'5': >-
  “How did Rāma, the great-armed, whose actions are ever true and never vain,
  abandon the devoted people and go forth to the forest as an ascetic?”
'6': >-
  “He who always protects us like a father protects his own sons—how did that
  best of the Raghu race, casting us off, go to the wilderness?”
'7': >-
  “Let us go to our death here itself—or let it be the great departure (from
  life). For of us who are without Rāma, for what purpose is life desirable or
  of any good?”
'8': >-
  “There are dry logs—many of them, and great as well. With those let us kindle
  a funeral pyre, and all of us enter it, if we must.”
'9': >-
  “What shall we say? That great-armed Rāghava—free from malice, sweet of
  speech—has been led away by us: how can we endure to say such a thing?”
'10': >-
  “That city surely, seeing us without Rāghava, will become wretched and
  joyless—women, children, and the aged all the more so.”
'11': >-
  “Ever did we go forth together with that hero, that great-souled one; and now,
  bereft of him again—how shall we look upon that city?”
'12': >-
  Thus, in many ways, raising their arms, those people—afflicted with
  sorrow—wailed, like chief cows that have lost their calves.
'13': >-
  Then, proceeding along the path, after going a little further, they were
  overwhelmed by a great dejection, for the way had become lost (to them).
'14': >-
  Following the track of the chariot-road, those high-minded men turned back,
  saying, “What is this? What shall we do? We are smitten by fate.”
'15': >-
  Then, by that very route along which they had come, weary at heart, they all
  went to Ayodhyā—the city whose people were distressed and afflicted.
'16': >-
  And beholding that city, their minds troubled as though by ruin, they caused
  tears to well up and flow from their eyes, tormented by grief.
'17': >-
  “This city, bereft of Rāma, does not shine greatly—like a river whose serpent
  has been drawn up from the pool by Garuḍa.”
'18': >-
  They beheld the city, its joy slain—like the sky without the moon, like the
  ocean without water— and they became as men beside themselves.
'19': >-
  Entering those mansions of great wealth—grief-stricken and entering in
  grief—they found no delight at all, whether in their own folk or in others;
  and as they were looked upon, their happiness wholly perished.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the forty-seventh canto, called “The Return of the Citizens,” in the
  Ayodhyākāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
