  Now begins the second canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Assent of the Royal Council.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon the lord of the earth, having summoned the entire royal assembly,
  spoke these well-known words, salutary and gladdening to hear.
'2': >-
  With a mighty voice—deep, resonant, and like the sound of a kettledrum— the
  king made it resound, like a cloud thundering.
'3': >-
  Endowed with the marks of royalty, handsome and incomparable, the ruler of men
  addressed the kings in a voice rich with feeling and sweetness.
'4': >-
  This is known to you: how my excellent kingdom has been guarded and cherished
  by my royal forefathers as though it were their own son.
'5': >-
  I too—having inherited what was protected by all the Ikṣvāku kings, the lords
  of men—desire to unite it with greater welfare, for the ease and happiness of
  the whole world.
'6': >-
  Following the path practiced by the ancients, I have ever protected the
  subjects with wakeful vigilance, according to my strength.
'7': >-
  This body of mine has grown old while I have moved about for the welfare of
  the entire world, beneath the shade of the pale royal parasol.
'8': >-
  Having lived for many thousands of years and attained many spans of life, I
  now choose repose for this aged body.
'9': >-
  Wearing the majesty of kingship—hard to bear by those who have not conquered
  their senses—I am weary, having carried the heavy yoke of dharma for the
  people.
'10': >-
  Therefore I desire rest, after appointing my son to the task of the people’s
  welfare, and after securing the assent of all these eminent brāhmaṇas who are
  near at hand.
'11': >-
  For my son excels in all virtues, born after my own kind; Rāma, the conqueror
  of hostile cities, is equal in prowess to Purandara (Indra).
'12': >-
  That bull among men—best among the uphold­ers of dharma, joined with Puṣya
  like the moon with its auspicious constellation—I shall appoint tomorrow
  morning to the office of yuvarāja.
'13': >-
  He will be a fitting lord for you—fortunate, and the elder brother of
  Lakṣmaṇa—by whose lordship even the three worlds would become more truly
  protected.
'14': >-
  By this act of welfare I shall at once unite this earth with well-being; and,
  placing the burden upon that son, I shall become free from strain.
'15': >-
  Since this aim, befitting my purpose, has been well deliberated by me, let you
  grant me consent—how indeed should I proceed?
'16': >-
  Even though this is my own cherished wish, let what is beneficial be further
  considered; but another, merely neutral line of thought, tends to yield more
  to contention than to harmony.
'17': >-
  As he spoke thus, the kings, delighted, applauded the king—like peacocks
  crying out when a great rain-cloud pours.
'18': >-
  Then, stirred by joy, a warm and affectionate roar arose—the shout of the
  multitude—seeming to make the earth herself tremble.
'19': >-
  Understanding in every way the intention of that knower of dharma and artha,
  the brāhmaṇas and the foremost among the mighty, together with the townsmen
  and countryfolk,
'20': >-
  assembled to deliberate with minds of one accord; and, having grasped it in
  their hearts, they spoke to aged King Daśaratha:
'21': >-
  “O sovereign, you are advanced in age by many thousands of years; therefore
  anoint Rāma as yuvarāja, O king.”
'22': >-
  “For we long to see Rāma—mighty-armed, the hero of the Raghu line, of great
  strength—proceeding on a great elephant, his face shaded by the royal
  umbrella.”
'23': >-
  Hearing those words, so pleasing to their hearts, the king—though he
  knew—spoke as if inquiring:
'24': >-
  “Hearing this speech—that you desire Rāghava as your lord—this doubt arises in
  me; therefore tell me the truth of it.”
'25': >-
  “How is it that, while I rule the earth in accordance with dharma, you desire
  to behold as yuvarāja that mighty one?”
'26': >-
  They, high-souled men, together with the townsmen and countryfolk, said to
  him: “O king, many auspicious virtues are found in your son.”
'27': >-
  “The virtues of that virtuous one—godlike, wise—dear and gladdening in their
  entirety—we shall declare today; listen to them.”
'28': >-
  “In divine qualities Rāma is equal to Śakra (Indra); his valor is true and
  unfailing; and, O lord of the people, he surpasses all the Ikṣvākus as well.”
'29': >-
  “Rāma is a good man in the world—truthful, devoted to truth; from Rāma himself
  have arisen dharma and prosperity together, as though made manifest.”
'30': >-
  “In giving happiness to the subjects he is like the moon; in the forbearance
  of the earth he is like the earth herself; in intellect he is equal to
  Bṛhaspati; in prowess he is like Śacī’s lord (Indra) in person.”
'31': >-
  “He knows dharma, is steadfast in truth, is of good conduct, free from malice;
  patient, a consoler, gentle in speech; grateful, and one who has conquered his
  senses.”
'32': >-
  “Soft in demeanor, yet firm in mind; ever courteous and free of envy; pleasing
  of speech to beings, and truthful of speech is Rāghava.”
'33': >-
  “He reverently attends upon learned and aged brāhmaṇas; therefore in this
  world his incomparable fame, renown, and splendor ever increase.”
'34': >-
  “Among devas, asuras, and men he is skilled in all weapons; properly trained,
  having duly completed study and observances; a knower of the Vedas with their
  limbs (aṅgas), as is fitting.”
'35': >-
  “In music (gāndharva) too, Bharata’s elder brother has become the best on
  earth; of noble lineage, virtuous, unbroken in spirit, and of great
  understanding.”
'36': >-
  “Well disciplined by the twice-born—by the best, who are adept in dharma and
  artha—whenever he goes forth to battle for a village or for a city,”},{
'37': >-
  “he does not return without conquering, going with Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) at his
  side; and after coming back from battle, whether on elephant or in
  chariot,”},{
'38': >-
  “he always asks after the welfare of the townsmen as if they were his own
  kinsmen—about their sons, their sacred fires, their wives, and their servants
  and pupils as well.”
'39': >-
  “In full and in due order, like a father to his own sons, he asks: ‘Do your
  disciples attend upon you? Are you well armored and equipped?’”
'40': >-
  “Thus does that tiger among men, Rāma, always speak; and in the misfortunes of
  men he becomes deeply grieved.”
'41': >-
  “And in all festivals he is pleased like a father; he is truthful, a great
  archer, a servant of the elders, and self-controlled.”
'42': >-
  “He speaks with a smile first; he rests wholly upon dharma; he speaks rightly
  of what is good; and he has no taste for quarrelsome talk.”
'43': >-
  “In ever more fitting and sound reasoning he is a speaker like Vācaspati; with
  lovely brows and long lotus-reddened eyes, he is like Viṣṇu himself made
  visible.”
'44': >-
  “This Rāma—delightful to the world by his courage, vigor, and valor— is
  devoted to the protection of the subjects, and his senses are not struck down
  by passion.”
'45': >-
  “He is able even to enjoy the three worlds—what then of this earth? Neither
  his anger nor his favor is ever without purpose.”
'46': >-
  “By rule he slays only those who are to be slain; he does not become angry
  with those who should not be slain; and rejoicing, he employs wealth for
  proper ends, and delights where delight is rightful.”
'47': >-
  “With virtues that are restrained, beloved of all subjects, and that generate
  affection in men, Rāma shines—like the blazing sun with its rays.”
'48': >-
  “The earth herself desires that Rāma—endowed with such qualities, of true
  valor—be her lord, resembling a guardian of the world.”
'49': >-
  “Blessed indeed! Your son Rāghava is born for the highest good—endowed with
  the virtues of a son—like Mārīci to Kaśyapa.”
'50': >-
  “The strength, health, and long life of Rāma, who knows himself, are renowned
  among devas, asuras, and men, and among gandharvas and nāgas as well.”
'51': >-
  “All people in the realm and in the best of cities hope for it—both those
  within and those without—the townsmen and the countryfolk alike.”
'52': >-
  “Women, the aged, and young women—composed in mind at evening and at dawn—all
  worship the gods for Rāma’s sake, O king. May what they have thus prayed for
  prosper through your favor.”
'53': >-
  “May we behold Rāma, dark as the blue lotus, the destroyer of all enemies,
  established in the office of yuvarāja—your best of royal sons.”
'54': >-
  “Therefore you ought, O bestower of boons, to anoint without delay that son of
  yours—like a god among gods—who is set upon the welfare of the whole world,
  and who is devoted to what is noble—for our good.”
'55': >-
  Thus ends the second canto, called “The Assent of the Royal Council,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
