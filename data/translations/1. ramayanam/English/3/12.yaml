  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the twelfth
  chapter called “The Meeting with Agastya.”
'1': >-
  Having entered that hermitage-ground, Lakṣmaṇa, the younger brother of
  Rāghava, approached a disciple of Agastya and spoke these words:
'2': >-
  “There is a king named Daśaratha; his firstborn son, mighty in strength, is
  Rāma. He has come to behold the sage, along with his wife Sītā.”
'3': >-
  “I am his brother named Lakṣmaṇa—his younger, well-wishing brother—ever
  favorable and devoted, if my name has reached your ears.”
'4': >-
  “Obeying our father’s command, we have all entered this exceedingly fierce
  forest. We desire to see the Blessed One—please convey this to him.”
'5': >-
  Hearing that speech of Lakṣmaṇa, the disciple—rich in austerity—said, “So be
  it,” and, going toward the sacred fire, entered in to make the announcement.
'6': >-
  Entering the presence of the foremost of sages—unassailable through his
  ascetic power—he spoke with folded hands, clearly reporting the arrival of
  Rāma:
'7': >-
  “As was stated by Lakṣmaṇa himself, these two are the sons of Daśaratha—Rāma
  and Lakṣmaṇa—approved and esteemed by you, O Agastya.”
'8': >-
  “They have entered the precincts of the hermitage with Sītā, his wife. Those
  subduers of foes have come to see you, for the sake of serving you.”
'9': >-
  “What should follow next in this matter—you are pleased to command. Thus the
  disciple has reported: Rāma has arrived along with Lakṣmaṇa,”—and with
  Vaidehī, the highly fortunate one.
'10': >-
  Agastya spoke these words: “By good fortune, Rāma has today, after a long
  time, come to see me.”
'11': >-
  “His coming has indeed been desired in my mind as well. Let Rāma be escorted
  with honor—together with his wife and with Lakṣmaṇa.”
'12': >-
  “Let him be brought near me. Why has he not been admitted?” Thus spoke the
  sage—righteous-minded and great-souled.
'13': >-
  Having bowed, the disciple replied, “So be it,” with joined palms in
  disciplined reverence. Then, hurriedly coming out, the disciple spoke to
  Lakṣmaṇa:
'14': >-
  “Let that Rāma come to see the sage; let him enter in person.” Thereupon
  Lakṣmaṇa, together with the disciple, went to the hermitage-ground,
'15': >-
  and showed the son of Kakutstha—Rāma—and also Sītā, the daughter of Janaka.
  Then the disciple, speaking gentle words and conveying Agastya’s message,
'16': >-
  admitted them according to proper rule—he who was worthy of honor, and who was
  well honored. Then Rāma entered, together with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa,
'17': >-
  gazing upon that hermitage—quiet and serene, thronged with peaceful deer.
  There he beheld the seat of Brahmā and likewise the seat of Agni,
'18': >-
  the seat of Viṣṇu, the seat of great Indra, and the seat of Vivasvān (the
  Sun); the seat of Soma, the seat of Bhaga, and also the seat of Kubera,
'19': >-
  the seat of Dhātṛ and Vidhātṛ, and likewise the seat of Vāyu; and the seat of
  the great-souled Varuṇa, who bears the noose in his hand,
'20': >-
  and likewise the seat of Gāyatrī, and the seat of the Vasus; and the seat of
  the king of Nāgas, and also the seat of Garuḍa,
'21': >-
  and the seat of Kārtikeya, and the seat of Dharma. Then the sage too,
  surrounded by his disciples, came forth to meet them.
'22': >-
  Rāma saw him in front—among the sages of blazing splendor. The heroic one
  spoke to Lakṣmaṇa, who ever increases prosperity:
'23': >-
  “Lakṣmaṇa, the blessed sage Agastya is coming out. By his magnanimity I
  recognize in him a veritable treasure-house of austerities.”
'24': >-
  Saying thus, the mighty-armed Raghunandana seized the feet of Agastya, radiant
  like the sun, as he came forward,
'25': >-
  and after paying reverence, righteous-souled Rāma stood with folded
  hands—together with Vaidehī Sītā, and with Lakṣmaṇa.
'26': >-
  Receiving the son of Kakutstha, honoring him with a seat and water, and
  inquiring after his welfare, Agastya said, “Be seated.”
'27': >-
  Having offered oblations into the fire, having given the arghya offering, and
  duly honored the guests, he provided them food in accordance with the
  forest-dweller’s dharma,
'28': >-
  and then—first sitting down—the sage-bull, knower of dharma, addressed Rāma
  who sat with palms joined, himself well-versed in righteousness:
'29': >-
  “Having offered into the fire and having given arghya, one should honor the
  guest. Otherwise, O Kakutstha, a practicing ascetic who behaves differently
  will, in the next world, like one with evil witnesses against him, eat his own
  flesh.”
'30': >-
  “A king is the upholder of dharma for the entire world, a great charioteer.
  You are worthy of worship and honor; you have come as a dear guest.”
'31': >-
  Having spoken thus, and having honored Rāghava to his heart’s content with
  fruits, roots, flowers, and other offerings, Agastya then said to him:
'32': >-
  “Here is this divine and great bow, adorned with gold and diamond—Vaiṣṇava in
  nature, O tiger among men—fashioned by Viśvakarmā.”
'33': >-
  “And here is an unfailing, sun-bright, supreme arrow—bestowed by Brahmā—and
  two quivers of inexhaustible missiles, given to me by great Indra.”
'34': >-
  “They are filled with keen arrows, blazing like fires. And here is this sword,
  housed in a splendid scabbard, adorned with gold.”
'35': >-
  “With this bow, O Rāma, having slain great asuras in battle, Viṣṇu in former
  times brought radiant glory to the gods.”
'36': >-
  “Therefore, O giver of honor, accept this bow, the two quivers, the arrow, and
  the sword for your victory—just as the wielder of the thunderbolt accepts the
  thunderbolt.”
'37': >-
  Having spoken thus, the great-splendored Lord Agastya bestowed upon Rāma all
  those excellent weapons, and again spoke:
'38': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa—this primeval epic—within the Araṇya-kāṇḍa,
  the twelfth chapter called “The Meeting with Agastya.”
