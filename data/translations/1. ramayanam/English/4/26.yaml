  Now begins the twenty-sixth canto, named “The Coronation of Sugrīva,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Thereafter the great officers among the monkeys, surrounding Sugrīva—who was
  scorched by grief and whose garments were wet—stood by him in attendance.
'2': >-
  Approaching Rāma, the mighty-armed one of unwearied deeds, they all stood with
  folded palms, like sages standing before Brahmā, the Grandsire.
'3': >-
  Then Hanūmān, son of the Wind-god—resplendent like a golden mountain and with
  a face like the rising young sun—spoke these words with folded hands:
'4': >-
  “By thy grace, O Kākutstha, a great ancestral and paternal realm of these
  monkeys of fine fangs, endowed with complete strength and power,
'5': >-
  —a sovereignty difficult even for great souls to obtain—has been obtained, O
  lord. Now, permitted by thee, let him enter the auspicious city;
'6': >-
  and together with the company of his well-wishers he shall duly set in order
  and accomplish all affairs. He has bathed according to rule with diverse
  perfumes and medicinal herbs;
'7': >-
  and he shall worship thee especially with garlands and jewels. Deign thou to
  come to this delightful mountain-cave.
'8': >-
  Establish the bond between lord and servant, and gladden the monkeys.” Thus
  addressed by Hanūmān, Rāghava, the slayer of hostile heroes,
'9': >-
  the wise one, skilled in speech, replied to Hanūmān: “O gentle one, for
  fourteen years—whether in village or in city—
'10': >-
  I shall not enter (a town), being one who obeys my father’s command. Let
  Sugrīva, bull among monkeys, having entered the prosperous, divine cave-like
  city,
'11': >-
  be anointed without delay to the kingdom, according to rite.” Having thus
  spoken to Hanūmān, Rāma then said to Sugrīva:
'12': >-
  “Anoint this heroic Aṅgada also as heir-apparent—he who knows what is right
  and is endowed with good conduct, who is noble in strength and valour.
'13': >-
  For the eldest son belongs to the eldest; and he is also equal in prowess.
  This Aṅgada, of undaunted spirit, is a fit recipient of the heir-apparency.
'14': >-
  This is the former month of the rains, Śrāvaṇa, the bringer of waters. O
  gentle one, the four months called the rainy season have commenced.
'15': >-
  This is not the time for exertion. Do thou enter the auspicious city; I shall
  dwell in this mountain, O gentle one, together with Lakṣmaṇa.
'16': >-
  This mountain-cave is delightful and spacious, with fitting breezes; it has
  abundant waters, O gentle one, and plentiful lotuses and water-lilies.
'17': >-
  When Kārtika has arrived, then strive for the slaying of Rāvaṇa. This is our
  appointed time, O gentle one. Do thou enter thine own abode,
'18': >-
  be anointed to the kingdom, and gladden thy friends.” Thus permitted by Rāma,
  Sugrīva, bull among monkeys,
'19': >-
  entered the delightful city of Kiṣkindhā, once protected by Vāli. And
  thousands of monkeys,
'20': >-
  surrounded the monkey-lord as he entered, crowding in from every side about
  the ruler of the monkeys. Then all the citizens (and attendants),
'21': >-
  seeing the lord of the hosts of monkeys, bowed with their heads and fell upon
  the ground, composed and reverent. Sugrīva, mighty in valour, addressed all
  those subjects and raised them up.
'22': >-
  Then the great and mighty one entered the gentle inner apartments of his
  brother. When Sugrīva, bull among monkeys, terrible in prowess, had entered,
'23': >-
  his well-wishers anointed him, as the gods anoint Indra of a thousand eyes.
  For him they brought a pale-white parasol adorned with gold;
'24': >-
  also two white yak-tail fans with golden handles, bestowers of renown; and
  likewise all jewels, and all seeds and medicinal herbs;
'25': >-
  sprouts and blossoms of milk-yielding trees; white garments, and white
  unguents for anointing;
'26': >-
  fragrant garlands—born on land and in water—divine sandalwood, and many kinds
  of manifold perfumes;
'27': >-
  unbroken rice, gold, and priyangu-grain, honey and ghee; curd, a tiger-skin,
  and a pair of most precious sandals as well;
'28': >-
  taking also materials for ceremonial touching, together with cow’s yellow
  pigment (gorocanā) and red arsenic (manaḥśilā), there came there, rejoicing,
  sixteen excellent maidens.
'29': >-
  Then, in order to anoint the foremost of monkeys according to rite, having
  satisfied the best of twice-born priests with jewels, garments, and foods,
'30': >-
  the knowers of mantras offered oblations with mantra-purified ghee into
  Jātavedas, the kindled fire, upon a bed of kuśa-grass.
'31': >-
  Thereafter, on the lovely summit of a palace, upon a splendid seat set on a
  golden base, covered with excellent spreadings and adorned with variegated
  garlands,
'32': >-
  having placed him thereon according to ritual with mantras, facing east; and
  having gathered waters from rivers and streams, and from holy fords on every
  side,
'33': >-
  and having also brought pure waters from all the seas, the bull-like monkeys
  placed that spotless water into golden pitchers.
'34': >-
  With auspicious jars furnished with horns of the r̥ṣabha (bull), and with
  golden vessels too—according to the procedure seen in the scriptures and
  ordained by great ṛṣis—
'35': >-
  Gaja, Gavākṣa, Gavaya, Śarabha, Gandhamādana, and also Mainda and Dvivida,
  along with Hanūmān and Jāmbavān,
'36': >-
  anointed Sugrīva with clear, fragrant water, even as the Vasus anoint Vāsava
  (Indra) of a thousand eyes.
'37': >-
  When Sugrīva had been anointed, all the foremost monkeys—those great
  souls—shouted in joy by hundreds of thousands, exultant.
'38': >-
  And Sugrīva, lord of monkeys, fulfilling Rāma’s word, embraced Aṅgada and
  anointed him as heir-apparent.
'39': >-
  And when Aṅgada too had been anointed, the monkeys, full of compassion (and
  goodwill), those great souls, honoured Sugrīva, saying again and again, “Well
  done! Well done!”
'40': >-
  And all of them, delighted, again and again praised great-souled Rāma and
  Lakṣmaṇa as well, for such matters as had come to pass there.
'41': >-
  That delightful city of Kiṣkindhā in the mountain-cavern became filled with
  rejoicing and thriving folk, and shone with banners and standards.
'42': >-
  Then the valiant lord of the monkey host, having reported to great-souled Rāma
  the grand coronation, and having regained Rumā as his wife, obtained the
  kingdom—like the lord of the thirty gods (Indra).
'43': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-sixth canto, named “The Coronation of Sugrīva,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
