  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins the fifty-ninth
  sarga, called “The Coronation of King Pūru.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that Uśanā was angered, the son of Nahuṣa, afflicted in mind, having
  come to extreme old age, spoke these words to Yadu:
'2': >-
  “Yadu, since you are one who knows dharma, let this be accepted for my sake:
  take upon yourself this utmost old age, my son. Through enjoyments I shall
  sport on, O great-famed one.”
'3': >-
  “I am not yet one whose purpose has been fulfilled amid the objects of the
  senses, O bull among men. After experiencing desire as I wish, then shall I
  attain old age.”
'4': >-
  Having heard that speech, Yadu replied to that bull among men: “Let Pūru, your
  beloved son, indeed accept old age.”
'5': >-
  “As for me, O king, I have been kept outside in matters of wealth and
  privilege, and even in closeness (to you). Let the king accept it—who, along
  with whom, eats the meal?”
'6': >-
  Hearing his words, the king then spoke to Pūru: “This old age, O mighty-armed
  one, for my sake must be accepted.”
'7': >-
  Thus addressed by Nahuṣa, Pūru, with joined palms, said: “I am blessed; I have
  been shown favor. I stand under your command.”
'8': >-
  Understanding Pūru’s words, Nahuṣa, with supreme joy, attained immeasurable
  delight, and he transferred that old age (from himself) unto him.
'9': >-
  Then that king, having become youthful, obtained sacrifices by the thousands,
  and for many thousands of years he protected the earth.
'10': >-
  Then, after a very long time, the king spoke to Pūru: “Bring back old age, my
  son; return to me what was deposited (with you).”
'11': >-
  “That old age, my son, was transferred to you by me as a trust; therefore I
  shall take back that old age—do not be distressed.”
'12': >-
  “And I am pleased, O mighty-armed one, by your acceptance of my command; and
  I, with a heart full of affection, shall consecrate you as lord of men.”
'13': >-
  Having thus spoken to his son Pūru, King Yayāti, the son of Nahuṣa, angrily
  addressed speech to the son of Devayānī:
'14': >-
  “You have become, as it were, a rākṣasa born of me in the form of a son—hard
  to assail—since you oppose my command. Be fruitless for the sake of
  offspring.”
'15': >-
  “Because you slight me—your father, who is also your guru—you shall beget
  dreadful rākṣasas and yātudhānas.”
'16': >-
  “Nor shall the line of that evil-minded one endure in the lineage sprung from
  the Soma-family; and your line, too, shall become like you—ill-disciplined.”
'17': >-
  Having thus spoken, the royal sage honored Pūru—augmenter of the realm—by the
  rite of consecration, and entered the hermitage.
'18': >-
  Then, in the course of much time, he reached the end ordained by fate; and
  King Yayāti, the son of Nahuṣa, departed to the threefold heaven.
'19': >-
  And Pūru governed that kingdom in accordance with dharma, endowed with great
  righteousness—he of great fame—in the excellent city called Pratiṣṭhāna, in
  the region of Kāśi.
'20': >-
  But Yadu begot thousands of yātudhānas, being excluded from the royal line, in
  the fortified city within the Krauñca-forest.
'21': >-
  Thus was he released by Uśanā; and the casting off of the curse by Yayāti was
  borne in accordance with kṣatriya-dharma—something that Nimi could not endure.
'22': >-
  All this has been related to you—the account of those who accomplish all ends.
  We shall follow it, O gentle one, so that no fault may arise, as (it did) in
  Nṛga.
'23': >-
  While he thus narrated, and Rāma, whose face was like the moon, listened, then
  the sky became sparsely starred; and the eastern quarter appeared reddened
  with the rays of dawn, as though a garment, loosened from its knot, were
  slipping down.
'24': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-ninth sarga, called “The Coronation of King Pūru,” in the
  Uttarakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
