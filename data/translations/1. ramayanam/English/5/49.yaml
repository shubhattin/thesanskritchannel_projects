  Now begins the forty-ninth sarga (chapter), named “The Manifestation of
  Ravana’s Majesty,” in the auspicious Valmiki Ramayana, in the Sundara-kanda.
'1': >-
  Thereafter Hanuman—of dreadful prowess, his eyes reddened with wrath—marveling
  at what he had accomplished, beheld the lord of the rakshasas.
'2': >-
  He saw him resplendent, adorned with costly and radiant gold; and with a
  great, lustrous diadem upon his head, encircled with a net of pearls, he shone
  with extraordinary brilliance.
'3': >-
  He was decked with golden ornaments of wondrous workmanship, set with precious
  gems, compounded as if with adamantine joinery—so exquisite it seemed as
  though fashioned by the mind alone.
'4': >-
  He was clad in most costly silken garments, smeared with red sandal-paste;
  anointed upon his own body, and adorned with varied and manifold
  embellishments.
'5': >-
  His form was strange yet striking to behold—red-eyed and terrible of
  aspect—his great fangs blazing, sharp and formidable, and his lips hanging
  down over his teeth.
'6': >-
  That heroic one, of mighty energy, shone with ten heads—like Mount Mandara
  with its many peaks thronged by diverse serpents.
'7': >-
  Like a heap of blue collyrium in hue, a necklace lay upon his breast and
  gleamed; with a face like the full moon, he resembled a rain-cloud with the
  rising sun upon it.
'8': >-
  His arms were bound with armlets, smeared with finest sandal-paste; his
  terrifying bracelets and ornaments glittered—like five-hooded serpents upon
  his limbs.
'9': >-
  He was seated at ease upon a splendid throne, spread with excellent
  coverings—set upon a great crystal dais, wondrously inlaid with combinations
  of gems.
'10': >-
  All around, he was most diligently attended upon by richly adorned women,
  close at hand, bearing yak-tail fans in their hands and rendering service.
'11': >-
  He was attended by the formidable Prahasta, by the rakshasa Mahaparshva, and
  by ministers who knew the true purport of counsel—along with Nikumbha, the
  counselor.
'12': >-
  And four other rakshasas, intoxicated with the pride of their strength, sat
  near him; and he was wholly surrounded by them—like the entire world
  encompassed by the four oceans.
'13': >-
  He was being encouraged and heartened by ministers skilled in the true
  principles of statecraft, and by other auspicious-seeing counselors—like the
  lord of the gods attended and reassured by the gods.
'14': >-
  Hanuman beheld the king of the rakshasas, exceedingly radiant—encircled (by
  his retinue) like a rain-cloud laden with waters resting upon the summit of
  Mount Meru.
'15': >-
  Though pressed in close by those rakshasas of dreadful might, Hanuman, filled
  with supreme astonishment, continued to gaze upon the lord of the rakshasas.
'16': >-
  Then, beholding the rakshasa sovereign blazing with splendor, Hanuman—his mind
  bewildered by that radiance—began to reflect within himself.
'17': >-
  “Ah, what a form! Ah, what steadfastness! Ah, what spirit! Ah, what
  brilliance! Ah, how completely endowed with every mark and sign is this king
  of rakshasas!”
'18': >-
  “If unrighteousness were not powerful in him, this lord of rakshasas would
  even be a guardian of the world of the gods—of Indra himself.”
'19': >-
  “Indeed, because of his cruel, pitiless deeds—reviled by the world—all worlds,
  together with the gods and the danavas, truly live in fear of him.”
'20': >-
  “When enraged, this one is capable of turning the whole world into a single
  ocean.” Thus did the intelligent monkey entertain many kinds of thoughts,
  having witnessed the majesty of the rakshasa king of immeasurable energy.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the forty-ninth sarga (chapter), named “The Manifestation of
  Ravana’s Majesty,” in the Sundara-kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the
  primordial epic.
