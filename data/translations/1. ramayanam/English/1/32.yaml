  Now, in the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Bala-kanda, begins the thirty-second
  sarga, entitled “The Episode of the Daughters of Kushanabha.”
'1': >-
  There was a great ascetic named Kusha, born of Brahma’s line; he was of mighty
  greatness, unwearied in vows, a knower of dharma, and one who honoured and
  revered the virtuous.
'2': >-
  That high-souled one, in a noble and well-matched consort of Vidarbha, begot
  four exceedingly strong sons, all worthy and alike in excellence.
'3': >-
  (They were) Kushamba, Kushanabha, Asurtarajas, and Vasu—radiant, of great
  energy and enterprise, desiring to act in accordance with the
  kshatriya-dharma.
'4': >-
  Kusha spoke to his sons, who were firmly established in dharma and devoted to
  truth: “Undertake governance and protection, my sons; thereby you shall attain
  abundant righteousness.”
'5': >-
  Hearing Kusha’s words, all four—foremost among men in the world—then
  established their settlements and founded their cities, those best of rulers.
'6': >-
  Kushamba, of great splendour, made the city of Kaushambi; and Kushanabha,
  righteous-souled, founded a city named Mahodaya.
'7': >-
  Asurtarajas, that lord of the earth, made the excellent city called
  Dharmaranya; and King Vasu founded the best of cities, Girivraja, for the
  Vasus.
'8': >-
  This, O Rama, is that land called Vasumati belonging to that great-souled
  Vasu; and these five foremost mountains shine all around on every side.
'9': >-
  The lovely river Sumagadhi came to the famed Magadhas; and among those five
  chief mountains it shines like a garland set in their midst.
'10': >-
  Indeed this is that Magadhi, O Rama, belonging to that great-souled
  Vasu—formerly frequented and dwelt upon, O Rama—rich in good fields and
  adorned with abundant crops.
'11': >-
  But Kushanabha, the royal sage, O delight of the Raghus, begot from Ghritachi
  an unsurpassed hundred daughters, while himself steadfast in dharma.
'12': >-
  Those maidens, possessed of the bloom of youth, beautiful and well adorned,
  came to the garden-grounds like a hundred lakes in the rainy season.
'13': >-
  Singing, dancing, and playing instruments, O Raghava, adorned with excellent
  ornaments, they attained the highest delight and festivity.
'14': >-
  Then those maidens, lovely in every limb and unmatched on earth in beauty,
  entered the garden-grounds like stars amid the intervals of clouds.
'15': >-
  Seeing them all—endowed with virtues and possessed of beauty and youth—the
  Wind, who moves everywhere, spoke these words:
'16': >-
  “I desire you all; you shall become my wives. Abandon the condition of being
  human, and you shall obtain long life.”
'17': >-
  “For youth is ever unsteady—especially among human beings. Having attained
  imperishable youth, you shall also become immortal.”
'18': >-
  Hearing those words of Vayu, whose deeds are unwearied, the hundred maidens
  then, after laughing at his speech, replied:
'19': >-
  “You move within all beings, O foremost among the gods; and we all know your
  power—why then do you slight us?”
'20': >-
  “We are all the daughters of Kushanabha, O god, O best of the celestials. We
  protect our austerity, O deity; (therefore) we are not to be swerved from our
  steadfast path.”
'21': >-
  “May that time not come, O dull-witted one, when, scorning our father who is
  truthful, we, departing from our own dharma, choose a bridegroom for
  ourselves.”
'22': >-
  “For our father is our lord, and he is our highest divinity; he whom our
  father will give to us—he shall be our husband.”
'23': >-
  But hearing their words, Hari (Vayu), filled with supreme anger, entered into
  all their limbs; that blessed and mighty lord broke and twisted their bodies.
'24': >-
  Of the measure of a span in stature, with limbs broken, afflicted by
  fear—those maidens, broken by the Wind, entered the king’s palace; and upon
  entering, they were greatly agitated, bashful, and with tear-filled eyes.
'25': >-
  Seeing those dear daughters—broken and yet exceedingly beautiful—wretched in
  their condition, the king then, deeply shaken, spoke thus:
'26': >-
  “What is this? Tell me, my daughters—who is it that dishonours dharma? By whom
  have you all been made hunch-backed? Though you are in distress, you do not
  speak.” Thus the king, heaving a sigh, then composed himself and entered into
  calm resolve.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-second sarga in the Bala-kanda of the Valmiki-Ramayana,
  the great epic, entitled “The Episode of the Daughters of Kushanabha.”
