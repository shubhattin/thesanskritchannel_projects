  Now begins the twenty-eighth canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the blessed
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Carrying Away of Jayanta.”
'1': >-
  Seeing Sumālin slain and reduced to ashes by Vasu, and also observing his own
  army scattered in flight, harassed and oppressed by the gods,
'2': >-
  thereupon that mighty one, the son of Rāvaṇa—Meghanāda—filled with wrath,
  rallied all the rākṣasas and took his stand for battle.
'3': >-
  That great charioteer, mounting a chariot that was fire-hued, able to go
  wheresoever he willed, rushed at that host, blazing like a fire entering a
  forest.
'4': >-
  As he advanced—bearing weapons of many kinds—the deities fled in all
  directions at the mere sight of him.
'5': >-
  Then none at all remained to face him, being eager to fight against him; and
  after he had struck them all and terrified them, Śakra spoke to the gods:
'6': >-
  “Do not be afraid; do not go away. Turn back in the battle, O gods. Behold, my
  son, unconquered, is going forth for the sake of combat.”
'7': >-
  Then Śakra’s son, the god famed by the name Jayanta, advanced to the
  battlefield in a wondrous chariot.
'8': >-
  And all those Thirty gods, surrounding the son of Śacī, met Rāvaṇa’s son in
  battle and smote him.
'9': >-
  And there arose a battle befitting gods and rākṣasas—between the son of great
  Indra and the son of the lord of rākṣasas.
'10': >-
  Then the rākṣasa prince shot golden-ornamented arrows at Gomukha, the son of
  Mātali—his charioteer.
'11': >-
  And the son of Śacī, Jayanta, likewise struck at his charioteer; but Rāvaṇi,
  enraged, pierced him on every side.
'12': >-
  For Rāvaṇi, overcome with wrath—mighty, with eyes wide in fury—covered Śakra’s
  son with showers of arrows.
'13': >-
  Then the enraged Rāvaṇi rained down, by thousands, weapons of many kinds,
  sharp-edged, upon the armies of the gods.
'14': >-
  Rāvaṇi hurled śataghnīs, clubs, spears, maces, swords, and axes, and even huge
  peaks torn from mountains.
'15': >-
  Then the worlds were sorely distressed, and darkness arose, as that son of
  Rāvaṇa kept slaying the enemy hosts.
'16': >-
  And that divine host, all around the son of Śacī, became in many ways
  disordered and ill at ease, tormented by arrows.
'17': >-
  They could not recognize one another—whether rākṣasa or deity—overturned here
  and there, running about on every side.
'18': >-
  The gods struck down gods, and rākṣasas struck down rākṣasas; bewildered,
  enveloped by darkness, others too fled hither and thither.
'19': >-
  In the meantime, the heroic and mighty Pulomā—lord of the daityas—seized
  Jayanta, the son of Śacī, and carried him away.
'20': >-
  Having seized that grandson, he entered the ocean at once; for Pulomā was his
  maternal grandsire, by whom that Śacī was begotten.
'21': >-
  Then, knowing of Jayanta’s destruction (or disappearance), all the gods became
  joyless and distressed, and ran about in confusion.
'22': >-
  But Rāvaṇi, exceedingly enraged and surrounded by his own forces, charged at
  those gods and let out a great roar.
'23': >-
  Seeing his son’s ruin and the deities fleeing, the Lord of the gods said to
  Mātali: “Let my chariot be brought.”
'24': >-
  And that celestial, most dreadful, already-prepared great chariot stood
  present—brought by Mātali—swift as a mighty wind.
'25': >-
  Then, upon that chariot, mighty clouds, flashing with lightning, moved before
  it, wind-driven, thundering with an exceedingly great sound.
'26': >-
  Many kinds of instruments were played; the Gandharvas, intent and composed,
  attended; and hosts of Apsarases danced as the lord of the Thirty set forth.
'27': >-
  Surrounded by Rudras, Vasus, Ādityas, Sādhyas, and the Marut hosts, armed with
  weapons of many kinds, the sovereign of the Thirty gods went forth.
'28': >-
  And as Śakra went out, a harsh wind blew; the Sun became lusterless, and great
  meteors fell.
'29': >-
  At that time, the valiant and mighty Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa) mounted a divine
  chariot fashioned by Viśvakarman.
'30': >-
  It was wrapped about with huge serpents, dreadful and making the hairs stand
  on end, as though blazing in battle by the hot wind of their breath.
'31': >-
  That chariot was surrounded by daityas and night-roaming rākṣasas, and the
  daitya, facing the battle, advanced against great Indra.
'32': >-
  But after restraining his son, he himself took his station; and Rāvaṇi too
  withdrew from the fight and sat down (or stood aside).
'33': >-
  Then the battle commenced between the gods and the rākṣasas, terrible as they
  showered weapons, like clouds in the season of storms.
'34': >-
  But Kumbhakarṇa, of wicked nature, raising many kinds of weapons, could not
  then be discerned in the battle—along with whom he fought, or against whom.
'35': >-
  With his teeth and his arms, and with lotus-shaped (or Padma-named) weapons,
  and with śaktis, tomaras, and iron darts, in furious rage he struck the gods
  in whatever way he could. Then that night-roamer, meeting the dread Rudras,
  fought with them in the battle, and was continually wounded by their weapons.
'36': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa shone with his body covered with weapons, streaming blood—like a
  rain-cloud bearing water, with the roar of thunder and the flash of lightning.
'37': >-
  Then that rākṣasa army, fighting with the Marut hosts, was wholly driven back
  in battle by diverse sharp weapons.
'38': >-
  Some, slain and hewn, still writhed upon the earth; others, entangled upon
  their mounts, remained standing there in the fight.
'39': >-
  Chariots, elephants, donkeys, camels, serpents, horses—also śiṃśumāras
  (river-monsters), boars, and those with faces like piśācas—were seen in the
  battle.
'40': >-
  Some, clasped fast in the arms (of foes), were held and lifted aloft; and the
  night-roaming rākṣasas, torn apart by the gods’ weapons, fell and died.
'41': >-
  That overflowing tumult of battle among them—of rākṣasas slain and
  careless—appeared upon the earth like a wondrous painting.
'42': >-
  At the forefront of battle a river began to flow—its water blood, its current
  sluggish—crowded with herons and vultures, having weapons for alligators.
'43': >-
  In the meantime, the wrathful and mighty Daśagrīva, beholding his entire force
  struck down by the gods,
'44': >-
  plunged swiftly into that swelling ocean of armies; slaying the Thirty gods in
  the combat, he advanced straight against Śakra himself.
'45': >-
  Śakra came forward, stretching his great bow with a mighty sound, by the
  reverberation of whose twang the ten quarters seemed to thunder.
'46': >-
  Drawing that great bow, Indra shot arrows at Rāvaṇa’s head—arrows radiant as
  fire and the sun.
'47': >-
  And likewise the great-armed Daśagrīva, standing firm, covered Śakra with a
  rain of arrows that tore at (or struck away) his bow.
'48': >-
  As those two fought, with showers of arrows on every side, nothing could then
  be made out, for everything was enveloped in darkness.
'49': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-eighth canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the venerable, sacred
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Carrying Away of Jayanta.”
