'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the
  thirty-eighth sarga called “Sugrīva’s Approach to Rāma.”
'1': >-
  Having accepted all that entire offering (of gifts) which had been brought as
  a present, he (Sugrīva) comforted all the vānaras and dismissed them all.
'2': >-
  After dismissing those thousands of monkeys—who had accomplished their
  appointed task—he deemed himself fulfilled in purpose, and (also deemed) the
  mighty-armed Rāghava accomplished in his aim.
'3': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, of dreadful prowess, spoke humble and courteous words to
  Sugrīva, the foremost among all monkeys, gladdening him.
'4': >-
  “Let us set forth from Kiṣkindhā, if it pleases you, gentle one.” Having heard
  that well-spoken utterance of Lakṣmaṇa,
'5': >-
  Sugrīva, exceedingly delighted, spoke these words: “So be it. Let us go; I am
  to remain under your command.”
'6': >-
  Having spoken thus, Sugrīva then dismissed Lakṣmaṇa of auspicious marks, and
  also Tārā and the other women.
'7': >-
  Saying loudly, “Come!” Sugrīva summoned the best of monkeys. Hearing his
  words, the monkeys quickly came.
'8': >-
  All those who were fit to appear before women, with joined palms held in
  reverence, came forward; then the king, resplendent like the sun, addressed
  them when they had arrived.
'9': >-
  “Quickly make ready my palanquin, O monkeys.” Hearing his command, those
  monkeys swift in action,
'10': >-
  promptly set up the palanquin, pleasant to behold. Seeing that palanquin
  prepared, the lord of monkeys
'11': >-
  said to Saumitrī (Lakṣmaṇa), “Mount quickly.” Having said so,
  Sugrīva—(mounting) that golden conveyance shining like the sun—
'12': >-
  ascended it together with Lakṣmaṇa, attended by many monkeys, while above his
  head a pale-white royal parasol was held aloft,
'13': >-
  and white chowries of yak-tail were waved all around; and he was greeted with
  the sounds of conches and kettledrums, and with the praises of bards.
'14': >-
  Thus Sugrīva, having attained the unsurpassed splendor of kingship, set forth.
  Surrounded by many hundreds of fierce monkeys bearing sharp weapons,
'15': >-
  he went to that place where Rāma was staying. Having reached that excellent
  region frequented by Rāma,
'16': >-
  the exceedingly radiant (Sugrīva) descended from the palanquin together with
  Lakṣmaṇa; and drawing near to Rāma, he stood with hands joined in reverence.
'17': >-
  When he stood with joined palms, the monkeys too stood likewise. Seeing
  him—like a lotus-bud upon a pond—Rāma became pleased toward Sugrīva and toward
  that great monkey host.
'18': >-
  Rāma lifted up the lord of monkeys, who had fallen at his feet with head
  bowed; and out of affection and respect,
'19': >-
  Rāghava embraced him. Having embraced him, the righteous-souled one then said,
  “Be seated.”
'20': >-
  Then, seeing him seated upon the ground, Rāma spoke: “He who, in due season,
  practices dharma, artha, and kāma,
'21': >-
  dividing them properly at all times—O hero, O best of monkeys—he is truly a
  king. But he who abandons dharma and artha and pursues kāma alone,
'22': >-
  awakens after a fall like one who, asleep upon a tree-branch, drops down when
  he is roused. A king who is engaged in the destruction of foes and devoted to
  the protection and gathering of friends,
'23': >-
  enjoys the fruits of the three aims of life and is established in dharma. Now,
  O destroyer of enemies, the time for exertion has arrived;
'24': >-
  therefore, O tawny-eyed one, let it be deliberated upon together with your
  counselors and the monkeys.” Thus addressed, Sugrīva spoke this reply to Rāma:
'25': >-
  “My prosperity and my fame, and even this enduring sovereignty of the
  monkeys—O mighty-armed one—have been regained by me through your favor.
'26': >-
  By your grace, O lord, and by my brother’s, O best of the victorious: one who
  does not repay a deed done is indeed a blemish among men.
'27': >-
  Here are the foremost monkeys, by the hundreds, O destroyer of foes; and
  powerful ones have arrived, having gathered all the monkeys on the earth.
'28': >-
  Bears and heroic monkeys, and the long-tailed ones too, O Rāghava—knowers of
  forests, wildernesses, and difficult strongholds—terrible in appearance—
'29': >-
  and monkeys who are sons of gods and gandharvas, able to assume forms at
  will—surrounded by their own hosts—are on the roads, O Rāghava.
'30': >-
  They range in hundreds and in hundreds of thousands, and likewise in crores;
  and they are arrayed in tens of thousands, O hero; in śaṅkus (vast
  multitudes), O scorcher of foes;
'31': >-
  in arbuda and in hundreds of arbuda, in the middle ranks and the rear
  ranks—monkeys and monkey-chieftains; hosts like oceans in number, and even
  beyond half of that—those monkeys—
'32': >-
  will come to you, O king, equal to Mahendra in valor—like clouds and mountains
  in appearance—dwelling about Meru and Vindhya.
'33': >-
  They will come to you to fight the rākṣasa in battle; and, having slain Rāvaṇa
  in war, they will bring back Maithilī.
'34': >-
  Then, seeing the preparations for energetic effort, the powerful son of the
  lord of the monkeys—who was obedient to that command—became filled with joy,
  his countenance like a fully awakened blue lotus.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-eighth sarga, called “Sugrīva’s Approach to Rāma,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
