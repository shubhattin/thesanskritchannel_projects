  Now begins the Seventeenth Canto of Sundara Kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Company of Rākṣasīs.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter the moon, stainless and of spotless rising, shining like a mass of
  white kumuda-lotus, went forth in the sky—like a swan moving upon blue waters.
'2': >-
  That moon, of pure radiance, as though rendering assistance, served the son of
  the Wind with his cool rays.
'3': >-
  Then he beheld Sītā, whose face was like the full moon—cast down, as it were,
  by the burden of sorrow, like a boat weighed down by heavy loads upon the
  waters.
'4': >-
  Hanumān, the son of Māruta, desiring to behold the princess of Videha, saw
  nearby the rākṣasīs of dreadful aspect.
'5': >-
  He saw one with a single eye, and one with a single ear; one whose ear was
  covered; one without ears; one with ears like spikes; and one whose nostrils
  seemed to breathe from the top of her head.
'6': >-
  He saw one of enormous body with a monstrous upper frame; one thin, with long
  hair upon her head; one with her hair ruined; one bald; and one wearing a
  mantle made of hair.
'7': >-
  He saw one with hanging ears and a hanging forehead; one with a pendulous
  belly and hanging breasts; one with drooping lips; one with a chin-lip (a face
  distorted at the chin and lips); one with a gaping mouth; and one with
  dangling knees.
'8': >-
  He saw some short and some tall; some hunchbacked; some hideous; some
  dwarfish; some frightful with gaping jaws; some with twisted faces; some with
  tawny eyes; and some with faces misshapen.
'9': >-
  Misshapen, tawny, dark—wrathful, fond of quarrel—bearing great lances of black
  iron, and iron clubs and hammers,
'10': >-
  some had faces like boars, deer, tigers, buffaloes, goats, and jackals; others
  had the feet of elephants, camels, and horses; and yet others had their heads
  fixed downwards.
'11': >-
  Some had but one hand and one foot; some had ears like those of asses; some
  had ears like horses; some had ears like cows; some had ears like elephants;
  and others had ears like monkeys.
'12': >-
  Some had exceedingly large noses; some had noses set crosswise; some were
  noseless; some had noses like elephants; and some had nostrils that seemed to
  breathe from the forehead.
'13': >-
  Some had feet like elephants—huge feet; some had feet like cows; some had feet
  with projecting spikes; some had head and neck beyond all measure; and some
  had bosoms and bellies beyond all measure.
'14': >-
  Some had mouths and eyes beyond all measure; some had long tongues and huge
  mouths; some had faces like goats; some like elephants; some like cows; and
  some like sows.
'15': >-
  Some had faces like horses, camels, and asses—rākṣasīs of dreadful
  appearance—bearing tridents and clubs in their hands, wrathful and delighting
  in strife.
'16': >-
  Terrible, smoke-haired, with distorted countenances—those rākṣasīs, ever
  drinking intoxicants, were always fond of liquor and flesh.
'17': >-
  Their limbs smeared with flesh and blood, feeding on flesh and blood—these did
  the foremost of monkeys behold, a sight that raised the hair on his body.
'18': >-
  They sat around a tree with stout branches, surrounding that plant; and
  beneath it sat that goddess-like lady, the blameless princess.
'19': >-
  The fortunate Hanumān discerned Janaka’s daughter—bereft of radiance, scorched
  by grief, her hair matted and soiled.
'20': >-
  Like a star fallen from the sky to the earth when its merit is exhausted, she
  seemed—rich in the testimony of good conduct, yet plunged into misery for want
  of her lord’s sight.
'21': >-
  Deprived of her finest ornaments, yet adorned with devotion to her husband;
  hemmed in by the lord of rākṣasas, and separated from her kinsmen.
'22': >-
  Like a lone elephant-cow held fast and beset by lions; like the crescent line
  of the moon at the end of a cloud-bank, veiled by autumnal clouds,
'23': >-
  her beauty marred—like a vīṇā unfit for touch from lack of practice—yet she
  was steadfast in her husband’s welfare, though helpless under the rākṣasas’
  power.
'24': >-
  In the midst of the Aśoka grove, sunk in an ocean of sorrow, she was there,
  encircled by them—like Rohiṇī with the planets gathered about her.
'25': >-
  There Hanumān beheld her like a creeper without blossoms. Though her limbs
  were smeared with grime, her form was still naturally fair; like a lotus-stalk
  stained with mud, she both seemed to shine and yet not shine.
'26': >-
  The monkey Hanumān saw that doe-eyed lady covered with a soiled and much-worn
  garment.
'27': >-
  He saw Sītā, dark-eyed—her face downcast—yet not downcast in spirit because of
  her husband’s splendour; protected by her own virtue and character.
'28': >-
  Seeing that Sītā, whose glance was like that of a young deer, she appeared
  like a startled doe-maiden, looking about on every side.
'29': >-
  With her sighs as though burning the trees that bore tender leaves, she seemed
  a very mass of griefs, like a wave of sorrow risen up.
'30': >-
  Beholding Maithilī—patient, with limbs well-proportioned, beautiful even
  without ornaments—Māruti attained an incomparable joy.
'31': >-
  Then Hanumān, seeing her of wine-like eyes, let fall tears born of joy, and
  there he bowed in reverence to Rāghava.
'32': >-
  Having made obeisance to Rāma and to Lakṣmaṇa, the mighty one—delighted by the
  sight of Sītā—became composed and self-restrained.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the Seventeenth Canto of Sundara Kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the First Epic, called “The Company of Rākṣasīs.”
