  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the Eighth
  Sarga, entitled “The Subjugation of Sumālī and the Rest.”
'1': >-
  While that host was being struck down from the rear by Padmanābha (the
  Lotus-naveled Lord), Mālyavān, being utterly checked, drew back—like the ocean
  retreating to its shore.
'2': >-
  That rākṣasa, with eyes reddened in fury and his crown shaking with wrath,
  spoke these words to Padmanābha, the Supreme Person.
'3': >-
  “O Nārāyaṇa! Thou knowest not, it seems, the ancient kṣatriya code; for with a
  mind that seeks not battle, and when we are afraid, thou slayest us as one
  would slay others (without due combat).”
'4': >-
  “Sinful indeed is the slaying of one whose back is turned; whoever—be he asura
  or otherwise—commits such a deed, that killer goes not to heaven, nor attains
  the worlds of those who perform meritorious acts.”
'5': >-
  “If thou hast faith in battle, O bearer of conch, discus, and mace, here I
  stand: behold me. Display then the strength that is thine!”
'6': >-
  Seeing Mālyavān standing firm like a mountain, the mighty younger brother of
  the Lord of the Devas addressed that lord of rākṣasas.
'7': >-
  “To the Devas, who were stricken with fear because of you, assurance of safety
  has indeed been granted by me; and the task of destroying the rākṣasas—that
  very charge—is now being fulfilled.”
'8': >-
  “Ever is the welfare of the Devas dear to me—even more than life itself;
  therefore I shall slay you, even if you have sunk down into Rasātala (the
  nether regions)!”
'9': >-
  As he—lotus-eyed, speaking thus, the Lord of gods—was addressing him, the
  rākṣasa king, enraged, pierced him in the side of the arm with a spear.
'10': >-
  That spear, loosed from Mālyavān’s arm and sounding like a bell, shone upon
  Hari’s breast like lightning amid a cloud.
'11': >-
  Then, grasping and wrenching out that very spear, the lotus-eyed Lord—beloved
  of the wielder of the spear—hurled it, aiming at Mālyavān.
'12': >-
  Released from Govinda’s hand, that spear sped forth like the dart discharged
  by Skanda, seeking the rākṣasa as though it were Indra’s thunderbolt aiming at
  the Añjana mountain.
'13': >-
  It fell upon the rākṣasa king’s broad chest, made resplendent by the burden of
  necklaces, like a thunderbolt striking a mountain peak.
'14': >-
  His armor and defenses shattered by that blow, he plunged into vast darkness;
  but Mālyavān, recovering himself, stood again—steadfast as an unmoving
  mountain.
'15': >-
  Then, seizing an iron trident, grim with many barbs, he struck the god hard
  between the breasts, driving it in firmly.
'16': >-
  And then that night-ranger, blood-maddened in battle, smote Vāsava’s younger
  brother with his fist, and having withdrawn the length of a bowshot, he
  retreated.
'17': >-
  Thereupon a great sound arose in the sky—cries of “Well done! Well done!”—and
  the rākṣasa, having assailed Viṣṇu, struck Garuḍa as well.
'18': >-
  Then Vainateya (Garuḍa), enraged, with the might of his wing-wind drove away
  the rākṣasa—just as a powerful gust scatters a heap of dried leaves.
'19': >-
  Seeing his elder kinsman routed by the wing-wind of the lord of birds, Sumālī,
  together with his forces, set out facing toward Laṅkā.
'20': >-
  Mālyavān too, that rākṣasa, hurled back by the power of the wing-wind,
  rejoined his own host and went to Laṅkā, enveloped in shame.
'21': >-
  Thus were those rākṣasas, many times in battle, broken by that Hari of
  lotus-eyes; their foremost leaders were slain.
'22': >-
  Unable to withstand Viṣṇu in combat and oppressed by fear, they abandoned
  Laṅkā and went to dwell in Pātāla, together with their wives.
'23': >-
  Having reached that rākṣasa Sumālī, O best of the Raghus, those renowned for
  valor took their stand in that lineage (race) famed as Sālakaṭaṅkaṭa.
'24': >-
  Those rākṣasas whom thou didst slay were called the Paulastyas: Sumālī,
  Mālyavān, Mālī, and all those who led them in front—every one of them, O
  highly fortunate one, was mightier than Rāvaṇa.
'25': >-
  And there is no other slayer of the rākṣasas—enemies of the gods and thorns to
  the Devas—save Nārāyaṇa alone, the God who bears conch, discus, and mace.
'26': >-
  Thou art Nārāyaṇa—God, four-armed, eternal—born to destroy the rākṣasas:
  unconquerable, the Lord, imperishable.
'27': >-
  Whenever the order of dharma perishes, in season after season, he is born
  among creatures for the destruction of the lawless, being ever affectionate to
  those who seek refuge.
'28': >-
  Thus, O king of men, have I declared to thee today, in full and in proper
  order, the entire origin of the rākṣasas. Now hear further, O best of the
  Raghus, all about the birth and incomparable might and influence of Rāvaṇa,
  together with his sons.
'29': >-
  For a long time Sumālī, that powerful rākṣasa, afflicted then by fear of
  Viṣṇu, wandered in Rasātala; thereafter, accompanied by sons and grandsons,
  the lord of wealth took up his abode in Laṅkā.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the Eighth Sarga, entitled “The Subjugation of Sumālī and the Rest,”
  in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic composed by
  the seer.
