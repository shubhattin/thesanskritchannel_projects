  Now begins the thirty-fifth canto in the Aranya Kanda of the glorious Valmiki
  Ramayana, entitled “Ravana’s return to Maricha’s hermitage.”
'1': >-
  Then, hearing those hair-raising words spoken by Shurpanakha, he—having
  permitted his counsellors (to withdraw) and having understood the
  matter—departed.
'2': >-
  Having followed up that affair and ascertained it correctly in every respect,
  and having weighed the faults and the merits, and having duly considered
  strength and weakness,
'3': >-
  having come to a firm decision within himself—“Thus indeed must it be
  done”—and being steady in counsel, he then went to the splendid chariot-shed.
'4': >-
  Having gone to the chariot-shed, the lord of the rakshasas, in concealment,
  urged on the charioteer, saying, “Let the chariot be yoked.”
'5': >-
  Thus addressed, the swift and vigorous charioteer, in a mere moment, yoked for
  him an excellent chariot, according to his desire.
'6': >-
  Mounting that wish-going chariot—golden, adorned with jewels, fitted with
  goblin-faced (ornamental) fittings—and yoked with asses bearing golden
  trappings,
'7': >-
  Ravana, the splendid lord of the rakshasas, the younger brother of Kubera, set
  out in that chariot with a sound like a cloud, towards the lord of rivers and
  streams (the great river/ocean-region).
'8': >-
  Ten-faced Ravana, fanned with a white yak-tail fan and shaded by a white
  parasol, shining like smooth vaidurya (cat’s-eye gem), and adorned with
  ornaments of heated (burnished) gold,
'9': >-
  that ten-necked one, with twenty arms and an attire delightful to behold—an
  enemy of the gods, a slayer of great sages—appeared like a mountain-king with
  ten peaks.
'10': >-
  Mounted on that wish-going chariot, the lord of the rakshasas shone forth like
  a cloud in the sky, encircled by a ring of lightning and accompanied by
  cranes.
'11': >-
  Gazing upon the region rich in prowess—its mountains, oceans, and
  marsh-lands—strewn everywhere with trees by the thousand bearing diverse
  flowers and fruits,
'12': >-
  and encompassed on all sides by lotus-ponds with cool, auspicious waters, and
  adorned with broad hermitage-sites furnished with altars,
'13': >-
  beautiful with groves of plantains, enhanced by coconut-palms, and by sal,
  tala, and tamala trees and other trees in full blossom,
'14': >-
  graced by supreme rishis of most restrained diet, and frequented by nagas, by
  birds (suparnas), and by gandharvas and kinnaras in their thousands,
'15': >-
  and adorned by siddhas who had conquered desire, and by charanas; by Ajās,
  Vaikhanasas, Māsas, Vālakhilyas, and Marīcipas (classes of ascetics),
'16': >-
  covered with celestial ornaments and garlands, and with apsarases in their
  thousands—divinely formed and skilled in the arts and amusements of sport,
'17': >-
  attended upon by the radiant wives of the gods, and honored (there), and
  thronged by companies of gods and danavas who moved about, feeding on
  ambrosia,
'18': >-
  filled with hamsas, kraunchas, and plavas (water-birds), and made lovely by
  sarasas; with smooth vaidurya-like slabs, dense and lustrous with the splendor
  of the sea,
'19': >-
  and with pale, vast aerial cars all around, decked with divine garlands and
  resonant with instrumental music and song,
'20': >-
  there the younger brother of Kubera beheld gandharvas and apsarases, coming
  and going in wish-moving vimanas—beings who by their austerities had conquered
  the worlds.
'21': >-
  He beheld pleasant forests by the thousand of sandal-trees rich in resin and
  sap at the roots—forests that delighted and satisfied the sense of smell,
'22': >-
  and groves and woodlands of excellent aguru, and of takkola and jati plants,
  bearing fragrant fruits,
'23': >-
  and the blossoms of tamala, and clumps of pepper-plants, and heaps of pearls
  lying along the shore, drying in the sun,
'24': >-
  and noble mountains, and masses of coral; and peaks of gold, and likewise
  peaks of silver,
'25': >-
  and delightful cascades—clear and wondrous; and prosperous places abounding in
  wealth and grain, and covered with women who were jewels among women,
'26': >-
  and cities dense with elephants, horses, and chariots; and he felt everywhere
  a gentle, cool, agreeable breeze, soft to the touch.
'27': >-
  In the marshy region of the ocean, the king of rivers, he saw a spot
  resembling heaven. There he beheld a cloud-like banyan tree surrounded by
  sages,
'28': >-
  the branches of which spread all around for a hundred yojanas—(that tree) from
  which, having seized a great elephant and a huge tortoise,
'29': >-
  the mighty Garuda came to a branch for the sake of food; and that branch,
  suddenly, under the weight—(borne) by that best of birds,
'30': >-
  was broken by the powerful suparna, laden thick with leaves. There,
  Vaikhanasas, Māsas, Vālakhilyas, and Marīcipas,
'31': >-
  Ajās, and other great rishis, gathered together, became smoke-hued
  (dust-darkened with alarm). Out of compassion for them, Garuda took up that
  hundred-yojana branch,
'32': >-
  broken off, and swiftly (bearing) both the elephant and the tortoise; and the
  righteous one, standing on a single foot, ate that flesh,
'33': >-
  and having slain (his prey) in the land of the Nishadas, the best of birds
  gained incomparable joy by setting the great sages free (from danger).
'34': >-
  And with that delight, his prowess doubled; the wise one then formed a resolve
  for the purpose of bringing ambrosia,
'35': >-
  and, crushing the iron nets, and breaking open the excellent
  jewel-house—guarded within the abode of Mahendra (Indra)—he then brought away
  that nectar.
'36': >-
  The younger brother of Kubera beheld that banyan tree, named Subhadra, marked
  by the deed of Suparna, and enjoyed by hosts of great rishis.
'37': >-
  Then, having gone to the farther shore of the ocean, lord of rivers, he saw,
  in a secluded place, a hermitage in a holy and lovely forest-region.
'38': >-
  There he saw the rakshasa named Maricha, clad in a black antelope-skin,
  wearing a circle of matted locks, and living on a restrained diet.
'39': >-
  Ravana approached him; and the king was duly honored by that rakshasa Maricha
  with superhuman objects of every desired kind.
'40': >-
  Having himself been duly revered with food and water, Maricha spoke words to
  him—speech courteous and purposeful:
'41': >-
  “Is it well with you, O king—O lord of the rakshasas—in Lanka? For what
  purpose have you, indeed, come here again in such haste?”
'42': >-
  Thus addressed by Maricha, mighty in radiance, Ravana—skilled in
  speech—thereupon spoke these words:
'43': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fifth canto in the Aranya Kanda of the holy, glorious
  Ramayana composed by Valmiki, the first epic, entitled “Ravana’s return to
  Maricha’s hermitage.”
