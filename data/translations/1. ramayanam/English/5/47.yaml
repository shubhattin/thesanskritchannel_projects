  Now, in the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Sundara-kanda, begins the
  forty-seventh chapter, called “The Slaying of Prince Aksha.”
'1': >-
  When those five commanders of the army—together with their attendants and
  their chariots—had been slain by Hanuman, the king (Ravana), on hearing of it,
  set his mind upon battle and, with eyes intent and resolute, looked towards
  his son Aksha.
'2': >-
  Urged on by his (father’s) look and command, that valiant Aksha—bearing a
  golden, beautifully wrought bow—leapt up, like fire kindled by oblations at
  the prompting of foremost twice-born priests in the assembly.
'3': >-
  Then that mighty warrior, the bull among the Rakshasas, mounted his great
  chariot, radiant like the rising sun, overlaid everywhere with a network of
  blazing Jambunada-gold, and drove forth against that great monkey.
'4': >-
  That chariot was adorned with a pattern of heated Jambunada-gold, wrought by
  the amassed power of austerity; it bore banners, and its flagstaff was
  decorated with jewels; it was excellently yoked to eight swift and noble
  horses, fleet as the mind.
'5': >-
  It moved without obstruction, irresistible to devas and asuras; it shone like
  lightning, coursing through the sky, perfectly controlled. It was furnished
  with quivers, bound about with eight swords, set in splendid array, and fitted
  in due order with spears and javelins.
'6': >-
  Brilliant, fully equipped in every way, girt with golden garlands, and glowing
  with the splendour of moon and sun, he mounted that chariot—shining like the
  sun—and went forth, his prowess equal to that of the immortals.
'7': >-
  Filling the sky and the earth with its sound—like the rumbling of horses,
  elephants, and great chariots—he, surrounded by gathered forces, approached
  the monkey who sat ready and capable upon the gateway-tower.
'8': >-
  Reaching that monkey, the lion-eyed prince beheld him standing there—like the
  fire of the end of an age at the destruction of beings—astonished, newly
  roused to alertness, and looked upon him with eyes of high regard.
'9': >-
  Considering the speed and heroic might of that great-souled monkey, and also
  his own strength, the exceedingly powerful son of Ravana grew in splendour
  like the sun at the end of the age.
'10': >-
  Having grown wrathful on observing Hanuman’s prowess—firmly planted in battle,
  hard to restrain—self-possessed, he urged Hanuman in combat by discharging
  three keen arrows.
'11': >-
  Then, seeing that monkey—proud, unwearied, and fit to rout foes—Aksha, with
  spirit risen high, bow in hand and arrows at the ready, fixed his gaze upon
  him.
'12': >-
  Adorned with golden ornaments, armlets, and lovely earrings, swift in onset,
  he closed in upon the monkey. Their meeting in battle was incomparable—one
  that would stir even devas and asuras to amazement.
'13': >-
  The earth resounded; the sun did not blaze; the wind did not blow; even the
  mountain stood trembling. The clash of might between the monkey and the prince
  roared forth; the heavens thundered, and the ocean churned in agitation.
'14': >-
  That hero then struck the monkey on the head with three arrows—handsome-faced,
  golden-feathered, like venomous serpents—arrows released with the sure
  knowledge of concentration and of the principle of letting fly at the proper
  moment.
'15': >-
  With those arrows fallen together upon his head, his eyes turned, smeared with
  streaming blood, he shone—his rays as it were made of arrows—like the newly
  risen sun, like the orb of the sun wreathed in beams.
'16': >-
  Then Hanuman—the best of ministers to the lord of the monkeys—seeing that
  prince, the excellent king’s son, in battle, bearing a wondrous array of
  weapons and a splendid bow, rejoiced and, facing the fight, grew filled with
  ardour.
'17': >-
  Like the sun poised upon the summit of Mount Mandara, Hanuman—his anger
  swelling, his strength and valour held in full—then burned Prince Aksha,
  together with his forces and his chariot, by the fiery beams of his eyes.
'18': >-
  Thereupon, Aksha—his bow like Indra’s, pouring forth a rain of arrows in
  battle like a cloud of Rakshasas—quickly released his shafts upon Hanuman, as
  a cloud pours rain upon a lofty, immovable mountain.
'19': >-
  Then the monkey, seeing in the battle that prince—fierce in war, with growing
  splendour, strength, valour, and arrow-power—roared for joy with a voice like
  thunder.
'20': >-
  Then, from youthful impetuosity, proud of his might in battle, his anger
  swelling, his eyes like blood, Aksha rushed upon the peerless monkey in
  combat, as an elephant charges a great pit covered over with grass.
'21': >-
  Though forcibly struck down by his arrows, Hanuman raised a roar, deep as the
  rumbling of clouds; and, with sudden exertion, tearing into the sky, he
  appeared terrible, hurling about his arms and thighs with mighty swings.
'22': >-
  As Hanuman sprang up, that strong and valiant chief among Rakshasas—the rider
  of an excellent chariot—charged after him, scattering arrows, like a
  rain-cloud pelting a mountain with showers of stones.
'23': >-
  Those arrows of his, the heroic monkey avoided and slipped past along the
  wind-favoured path; darting between the shafts like the wind itself—swift as
  the mind—he displayed dreadful prowess in battle.
'24': >-
  Beholding Aksha, bow in hand and intent on battle, filling the sky with
  various excellent arrows, Hanuman looked upon him with eyes of respect—and yet
  the son of the Wind-god fell into thought.
'25': >-
  Then, pierced between the arms by arrows shot by that great-souled and
  foremost prince, the strong-armed monkey, roaring aloud, expert in discerning
  the true nature of action, considered in battle the course of his own prowess.
'26': >-
  “This mighty one, though but a youth, performs deeds great, shining like the
  young sun. And regarding the slaying of this warrior—skilled in every work of
  battle—no resolve is born in me here.”
'27': >-
  “This one is great-souled and great in valour; composed, and exceedingly
  enduring in combat. Without doubt, by the rise of his virtues and deeds, he is
  worthy of worship by sages, and by Nagas and Yakshas.”
'28': >-
  “With mind increased by courage and ardour, he confronts me, standing foremost
  before me. His prowess—swift in action—could shake the hearts even of devas
  and asuras.”
'29': >-
  “Surely he would not be overcome if treated with neglect, for his prowess
  grows in battle. Yet his destruction pleases me today; for a growing fire
  cannot be tolerated if left unheeded.”
'30': >-
  Thus reasoning about the other’s impetuous force, and having disposed his own
  action in battle, that very powerful one then put forth his speed, and at that
  time formed the resolve to slay him.
'31': >-
  Then that hero—Hanuman, son of the Wind—along the wind-favoured path struck
  down those eight excellent great horses of his, well-controlled and able to
  bear the weight and turns, with blows of his palms.
'32': >-
  Thereupon the great charioteer, struck by that palm, was overcome by him—the
  minister of the lord of tawny-hued monkeys. With its pole and yoke overturned,
  its horses slain, the chariot fell from the sky to the earth like a bird’s
  nest broken down.
'33': >-
  Abandoning his chariot, that great warrior—still with bow, and bearing
  sword—leapt up into the sky. Then, assailed, that prince of fierce prowess,
  quitting his body, departed like the wind to its own abode.
'34': >-
  Then the monkey, seeing him moving through the sky—attended by the lord of
  birds, the wind, and the Siddhas—rushed up with the speed and valour of the
  Wind and seized him firmly, step by step, by the feet.
'35': >-
  Whirling him round again and again a thousand times, that monkey—like Garuda,
  lord of birds, seizing a mighty serpent—then, with the prowess of one equal to
  his sire, hurled him with force upon the earth in battle, that foremost of
  monkeys.
'36': >-
  With arms, thighs, hips, and chest shattered; blood streaming; eyes crushed
  amid broken bones; joints smashed; bonds and ornaments scattered—thus that
  Rakshasa lay slain upon the ground by the son of the Wind.
'37': >-
  That great monkey, crushing him upon the earth, struck great fear into the
  lord of Rakshasas. And when the prince was slain, the monkey was beheld by
  great seers moving in their celestial cars, by gathered spirits, by Yakshas
  and serpents, and by the gods with Indra—exceedingly astonished.
'38': >-
  Having slain in battle that Prince Aksha—resembling the son of the wielder of
  the thunderbolt, with eyes like blood—at once that hero went back to the very
  gateway-tower, like Time at the destruction of beings.
'39': >-
  Thus ends the forty-seventh chapter of the Sundara-kanda in the revered
  Valmiki-Ramayana, the primeval epic, called “The Slaying of Prince Aksha.”
