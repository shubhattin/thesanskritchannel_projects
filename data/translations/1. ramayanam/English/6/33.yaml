  Now begins the thirty-third chapter in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, titled “Saramā’s Consolation (of Sītā).”
'1': >-
  Seeing Sītā deluded and bewildered, a rākṣasī named Saramā approached that
  Vaidehī—dear to her, affectionate, and a companion-friend.
'2': >-
  Then Saramā, gentle of speech, consoled Sītā—who had been beguiled by the lord
  of the rākṣasas and was afflicted with the deepest sorrow.
'3': >-
  For there, Sītā—while being guarded—had made Saramā her friend; and Saramā,
  though appointed by Rāvaṇa to guard her, was compassionate and steadfast in
  her vow.
'4': >-
  That companion Saramā beheld Sītā bereft of consciousness, turned back and
  risen (after collapsing), shattered and dust-covered—like a mare fallen in the
  dust.
'5': >-
  Out of the affection of friendship she comforted that noble-vowed lady: “Be
  soothed, O Vaidehī; let there not be anguish in thy mind. What thou wast told
  by Rāvaṇa—and what was contrived against thee by thine own urging—(do not take
  to heart).”
'6': >-
  “O timid one, out of friendliness I have learned and promised myself all
  this—having hidden in a lonely, secluded place and casting aside fear of
  Rāvaṇa. For thy sake, O large-eyed one, I have no fear of Rāvaṇa at all.”
'7': >-
  “That rākṣasa-lord, for whose sake he rushed out in agitation—of that matter I
  have understood everything, having gone out and observed it, O Maithilī.”
'8': >-
  “It is not possible to carry out a stealthy ‘sleeping’ attack upon Rāma, who
  is self-possessed and vigilant; nor can the slaying of that tiger among men be
  made to occur.”
'9': >-
  “Nor in this manner can those vānaras be slain—those like oceans of
  trees—since they are protected indeed by Rāma, as the gods are protected by
  Vāsava (Indra), the bull among the suras.”
'10': >-
  “He is long-armed, illustrious, broad-chested, mighty in splendour; bearing
  the bow, equipped with armour—righteous-souled and renowned upon the earth.”
'11': >-
  “Valiant, ever a protector of himself and of others; together with his brother
  Lakṣmaṇa; noble-born and versed in the science of polity and right conduct.”
'12': >-
  “A slayer of the hosts of the enemy, of inconceivable strength and manly
  prowess—Rāghava has not been slain, O Sītā, he who is the destroyer of foes.”
'13': >-
  “By a deed born of unyoked, misguided counsel—hostile to all beings—thus has
  this fierce, deceitful one (Rāvaṇa), a wielder of illusion, employed māyā
  against thee.”
'14': >-
  “Thy grief has departed; all auspiciousness has come upon thee. Surely Lakṣmī
  favours thee; hear, what is dear to thee is about to come to pass.”
'15': >-
  “Having crossed the ocean along with the army of vānaras, Rāma has encamped,
  reaching the southern shore of the sea.”
'16': >-
  “I have seen the Kakutstha prince with Lakṣmaṇa—his purpose fully
  accomplished—standing protected, together with forces stationed at the ocean’s
  edge.”
'17': >-
  “And those rākṣasas of swift valour who were sent (to spy) by him have
  returned here with this report: ‘Rāghava has crossed over.’”
'18': >-
  “Hearing that report, O large-eyed one, the lord of rākṣasas—Rāvaṇa—now
  deliberates there together with all his ministers.”
'19': >-
  Thus speaking, Saramā the rākṣasī, together with Sītā, heard the dreadful
  clamour of armies making every preparation.
'20': >-
  Hearing the great roar of the kettledrum-like war-drum, Saramā, sweet of
  speech, said this to Sītā:
'21': >-
  “This, O timid one, is the terrible war-drum that gives rise to the donning of
  armour. Hear the deep sound of the kettledrums, like the rumbling of a
  rain-cloud.”
'22': >-
  “Maddened elephants are being made ready; chariots and horses are being yoked.
  Horsemen are seen—by the thousands—with spears in hand.”
'23': >-
  “Here and there, armed and mail-clad, they rush forth by the thousands; the
  royal roads are filled up with armies of wondrous appearance.”
'24': >-
  “Like the ocean with torrents of water—swift and roaring—so (is the surge) of
  shining weapons, and of leather shields and coats of mail as well.”
'25': >-
  “This is the tumult of the rākṣasas—followers of the rākṣasa king—of chariots,
  horses, and elephants: a bustle of rejoicing, vigorous warriors.”
'26': >-
  “Behold the radiance they cast forth, arising in many colours—like the
  appearance of fire when, in the heat, it burns down a forest.”
'27': >-
  “Hear the clangour of bells; hear the rumbling of chariots; hear the neighing
  of horses, and likewise the sound of the musical war-instruments.”
'28': >-
  “With weapons raised in their hands—followers of the rākṣasa lord—this tumult
  of the rākṣasas is fierce and hair-raising.”
'29': >-
  “Fortune abides with thee, the destroyer of sorrow; fear has come upon the
  rākṣasas. Rāma, lotus-petalled of eyes, is like Vāsava (Indra) to the
  dāityas.”
'30': >-
  “Having conquered (his foes), and having mastered his wrath, of unthinkable
  prowess, thy lord will attain thee after slaying Rāvaṇa in battle.”
'31': >-
  “Thy husband, together with Lakṣmaṇa, will advance against the rākṣasas—like
  Indra, destroyer of enemies among enemies, together with Viṣṇu, in battle
  against foes.”
'32': >-
  “When Rāma arrives, and the enemy is struck down, I shall quickly behold thee,
  O chaste lady, taken into his embrace—thy purpose fulfilled.”
'33': >-
  “Thou shalt shed tears born of joy, O Jānakī, when thou meetest him and art
  clasped to the chest of that great-chested lord.”
'34': >-
  “Ere long, O Sītā, the mighty-armed Rāma will loose and release the braid of
  hair that has fallen upon thy back—worn by thee alone and kept bound for many
  months.”
'35': >-
  “Beholding his face, O goddess, risen like the full moon, thou shalt let go
  the water born of sorrow—like a serpent casting off its slough.”
'36': >-
  “After slaying Rāvaṇa in battle, not long hence, O Maithilī, he—made whole by
  thee, his beloved, and worthy of happiness—shall obtain happiness.”
'37': >-
  “Honoured by great-souled Rāma, thou shalt rejoice—like the earth, endowed
  with good rains, rejoices with abundance of crops.”
'38': >-
  “As a horse swiftly makes a circle while moving around a mighty mountain, so
  doth he move encompassing all. Seek refuge in him here, O goddess—the Sun, for
  he is the source and lord of creatures.”
'39': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-third chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-Kāvya, entitled “Saramā’s Consolation.”
