'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (Paramātman).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': >-
  Now, the Eighteenth Chapter: The Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation
  (Mokṣa–Sannyāsa–Yoga).
'3': 'Arjuna said:'
'4': >-
  O mighty-armed one, I desire to know the truth of sannyāsa (renunciation) and
  also of tyāga (relinquishment), O Hṛṣīkeśa; O slayer of Keśin.
'5': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'6': >-
  The wise know sannyāsa as the laying aside (nyāsa) of actions done with desire
  (kāmya-karmas); and the discerning declare tyāga to be the relinquishment of
  the fruits of all actions.
'7': >-
  Some thoughtful ones declare that action should be abandoned as defective;
  others say that acts of sacrifice, gift, and austerity should not be
  abandoned.
'8': >-
  Hear from Me the settled conclusion on this matter of tyāga, O best of the
  Bharatas; for tyāga, O tiger among men, has been declared to be threefold.
'9': >-
  Acts of sacrifice, gift, and austerity are not to be abandoned; indeed they
  must be performed. For sacrifice, gift, and austerity are purifying for the
  wise.
'10': >-
  But even these actions should be performed, abandoning attachment and also the
  fruits—this is My certain and highest decision, O Pārtha.
'11': >-
  Renunciation of obligatory (prescribed) action is not proper; abandoning it
  out of delusion is declared to be tāmasic.
'12': >-
  He who abandons action merely because it is painful, or out of fear of bodily
  hardship, having thus practiced rājasic tyāga, does not obtain the fruit of
  tyāga.
'13': >-
  When prescribed action is performed simply because it ought to be done, O
  Arjuna, abandoning attachment and the fruit as well—that tyāga is regarded as
  sāttvic.
'14': >-
  He does not hate unskilful action, nor does he cling to skilful action; such a
  renouncer, pervaded by sattva, intelligent, with doubts cut asunder—he is
  truly a tyāgī.
'15': >-
  For it is not possible for an embodied being to abandon actions entirely; but
  he who relinquishes the fruits of action is called a renouncer (tyāgī).
'16': >-
  The threefold fruit of action—undesired, desired, and mixed—accrues after
  death to those who do not relinquish; but never, at any time, to the
  sannyāsins.
'17': >-
  Learn from Me these five causes, O mighty-armed one, declared in Sāṅkhya (the
  teaching of right analysis), the final determination, for the accomplishment
  of all actions.
'18': >-
  The seat (the body), and the agent, and the various instruments; and the many
  distinct activities; and destiny (the divine factor) as the fifth—these are
  they.
'19': >-
  Whatever action a man undertakes by body, speech, and mind—whether proper or
  improper—these five are its causes.
'20': >-
  Therefore, this being so, he who, through an untrained understanding, sees the
  Self alone as the sole doer—he, of perverse mind, does not truly see.
'21': >-
  He whose being is free from egoism, whose understanding is not tainted—though
  he slays these people, he does not slay, nor is he bound.
'22': >-
  Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower—this is the threefold
  impulse to action; the instrument, the action, and the doer—this is the
  threefold basis of action.
'23': >-
  Knowledge, action, and the doer are also declared to be threefold,
  distinguished by the guṇas; hear of them as well, precisely as set forth in
  the reckoning of the guṇas.
'24': >-
  That knowledge by which one imperishable Being is seen in all beings—undivided
  in the divided—know that knowledge to be sāttvic.
'25': >-
  But that knowledge which, in all beings, perceives various distinct entities
  as separate—know that knowledge to be rājasic.
'26': >-
  But that which clings to one single effect as if it were the whole, without
  reason, without grasp of the truth, trivial—this is declared to be tāmasic.
'27': >-
  Action that is prescribed, performed without attachment, without love or
  hatred, by one who seeks no fruit—such action is called sāttvic.
'28': >-
  But action performed by one who desires pleasures, or again with egoism,
  undertaken with much exertion—that is declared to be rājasic.
'29': >-
  Action begun from delusion, without regard to consequence, loss, harm, and
  one’s own capacity—such action is called tāmasic.
'30': >-
  Free from attachment, not speaking in ego, endowed with firmness and zeal,
  unchanged in success and failure—the doer is called sāttvic.
'31': >-
  Passionate, craving the fruits of action, greedy, of violent nature, impure,
  swayed by joy and sorrow—the doer is proclaimed rājasic.
'32': >-
  Undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, malicious, lazy, despondent, and
  procrastinating—the doer is called tāmasic.
'33': >-
  Hear now, O Dhanañjaya, the threefold division, according to the guṇas, of
  understanding (buddhi) and firmness (dhṛti), declared fully and distinctly.
'34': >-
  That understanding by which one knows what is to be done and what is not to be
  done, what is to be feared and what is not to be feared, what binds and what
  liberates—such understanding, O Pārtha, is sāttvic.
'35': >-
  That understanding by which one knows incorrectly dharma and adharma, and what
  is to be done and what is not to be done—such understanding, O Pārtha, is
  rājasic.
'36': >-
  That understanding, covered by darkness, which thinks adharma to be dharma and
  sees all things in a reversed manner—such understanding, O Pārtha, is tāmasic.
'37': >-
  That firmness by which one holds steady the functions of mind, prāṇa, and the
  senses through unfailing yoga—such firmness, O Pārtha, is sāttvic.
'38': >-
  But that firmness by which one holds fast to dharma, desire, and wealth (kāma
  and artha), with attachment and longing for reward—such firmness, O Pārtha, is
  rājasic.
'39': >-
  That firmness by which a dull-witted person does not relinquish sleep, fear,
  grief, despondency, and also intoxication—such firmness, O Pārtha, is tāmasic.
'40': >-
  Now hear from Me, O bull among the Bharatas, the threefold happiness, wherein
  one delights through practice and comes to the end of sorrow.
'41': >-
  That which at first is like poison, but in the end is like nectar—such
  happiness is said to be sāttvic, born of the serenity of one’s own
  understanding of the Self.
'42': >-
  That happiness which arises from the contact of the senses with their
  objects—at first like nectar, but in the end like poison—is remembered as
  rājasic.
'43': >-
  That happiness which both at first and in its consequence deludes the self,
  arising from sleep, laziness, and negligence—that is declared tāmasic.
'44': >-
  There is no being on earth, or again in heaven among the devas, that is freed
  from these three guṇas born of prakṛti.
'45': >-
  Of brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, and śūdras, O scorcher of foes, the duties
  are distributed according to the guṇas born of their own nature.
'46': >-
  Serenity, self-control, austerity, purity, forgiveness, and also
  straightforwardness; knowledge, realized wisdom, and faith in the Veda and the
  Divine—these are the natural duties of a brāhmaṇa.
'47': >-
  Heroism, brilliance, firmness, skill, and not fleeing in battle; generosity
  and lordliness—these are the natural duties of a kṣatriya.
'48': >-
  Agriculture, protection of cattle, and trade are the natural duties of a
  vaiśya; and service in the form of attendance is also the natural duty of a
  śūdra.
'49': >-
  Devoted to his own work, a man attains perfection. Hear how one devoted to his
  own work attains perfection.
'50': >-
  From whom the activity of all beings proceeds, by whom all this is
  pervaded—worshipping Him through one’s own work, a human being attains
  perfection.
'51': >-
  Better is one’s own dharma, though devoid of excellence, than another’s dharma
  well performed. Doing the work fixed by one’s own nature, one does not incur
  sin.
'52': >-
  One should not abandon the work that is born with one’s nature, O son of
  Kuntī, even though it be faulty; for all undertakings are veiled by fault, as
  fire by smoke.
'53': >-
  With understanding unattached everywhere, self-conquered, free from craving,
  one attains the supreme perfection of actionlessness (naiṣkarmya) through
  sannyāsa (renunciation).
'54': >-
  How, having attained perfection, one reaches Brahman—learn that from Me, O son
  of Kuntī, in brief: that supreme culmination of knowledge.
'55': >-
  Endowed with a purified understanding, restraining the self with firmness,
  abandoning sound and the other sense-objects, and setting aside attraction and
  aversion,
'56': >-
  dwelling in solitude, eating lightly, with speech, body, and mind controlled,
  ever intent on the yoga of meditation, taking refuge in dispassion,
'57': >-
  relinquishing egoism, force, arrogance, desire, anger, and possessiveness;
  free from the sense of “mine,” tranquil—he becomes fit for
  Brahman-realization.
'58': >-
  Having become Brahman, serene in self, he neither grieves nor desires; equal
  towards all beings, he attains supreme devotion to Me.
'59': >-
  Through devotion he comes to know Me in truth—who and how much I am; then,
  having known Me in truth, he enters into Me immediately thereafter.
'60': >-
  Even while always performing all actions, taking refuge in Me, by My grace he
  attains the eternal, imperishable abode.
'61': >-
  Mentally renouncing all actions in Me, with Me as the Supreme, taking refuge
  in the yoga of understanding, be of mind fixed on Me at all times.
'62': >-
  With mind fixed on Me, you shall cross over all difficulties by My grace; but
  if, through egoism, you will not listen, you shall perish.
'63': >-
  If, taking refuge in egoism, you think, “I will not fight,” your resolve is in
  vain; your own nature will compel you.
'64': >-
  Bound by your own work born of your nature, O son of Kuntī, what you do not
  wish to do out of delusion, that you shall do even against your will.
'65': >-
  The Lord abides in the heart-region of all beings, O Arjuna, causing all
  beings to revolve—mounted as on a machine—by His māyā.
'66': >-
  Take refuge in Him alone with all your being, O Bhārata; by His grace you
  shall attain supreme peace and the eternal abode.
'67': >-
  Thus has knowledge been declared to you by Me—more secret than the secret.
  Reflect upon it fully, and then do as you wish.
'68': >-
  Hear again My supreme word, the most secret of all. You are dearly loved by
  Me, firmly so; therefore I shall speak for your good.
'69': >-
  Fix your mind on Me; be My devotee; sacrifice unto Me; bow down to Me. You
  shall come to Me alone—this truth I promise you, for you are dear to Me.
'70': >-
  Abandoning all dharmas, take refuge in Me alone. I shall liberate you from all
  sins; do not grieve.
'71': >-
  This is never to be spoken by you to one who is without austerity, nor ever to
  one who is not devoted, nor to one who does not wish to listen, nor to one who
  maligns Me.
'72': >-
  He who shall declare this supreme secret among My devotees, performing supreme
  devotion to Me—he shall come to Me alone, without doubt.
'73': >-
  And among men there shall be none more dear to Me than he who does this; nor
  shall there be any other on earth more beloved to Me than he.
'74': >-
  And he who will study this righteous dialogue of ours—by him I shall have been
  worshipped through the sacrifice of knowledge; this is My conviction.
'75': >-
  And the man who hears it with faith and without cavilling—even he, liberated,
  shall attain the auspicious worlds of those of meritorious deeds.
'76': >-
  Has this been heard by you, O Pārtha, with one-pointed mind? Has your delusion
  born of ignorance been destroyed, O Dhanañjaya?
'77': 'Arjuna said:'
'78': >-
  My delusion is destroyed; memory has been regained by me through Your grace, O
  Acyuta. I stand firm, with doubts dispelled; I shall do Your word.
'79': 'Sañjaya said:'
'80': >-
  Thus did I hear this wondrous, hair-raising dialogue of Vāsudeva and of
  Pārtha, the great-souled one.
'81': >-
  By the grace of Vyāsa I heard this supreme secret: this yoga spoken directly
  by Kṛṣṇa, the Lord of Yoga, Himself, as He was declaring it.
'82': >-
  Remembering again and again, O King, this wondrous and holy dialogue of Keśava
  and Arjuna, I rejoice again and again.
'83': >-
  And remembering again and again that most wondrous form of Hari, great is my
  amazement, O King, and I rejoice again and again.
'84': >-
  Wherever there is Kṛṣṇa, the Lord of Yoga, and wherever there is Pārtha, the
  wielder of the bow—there surely are fortune, victory, prosperity, and firm
  righteousness; this is my conviction.
'85': >-
  Om Tat Sat—thus in the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā Upaniṣads, in the science of
  Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna,
  ends the eighteenth chapter, entitled “The Yoga of Liberation through
  Renunciation.”
'86': >-
  Om. I bow to Viṣṇu—the embodiment of peace—reclining upon the serpent-couch,
  lotus-navelled, Lord of the gods; the support of the universe, vast as the
  sky, dark-hued like a cloud, of auspicious limbs; beloved of Lakṣmī,
  lotus-eyed, attainable by yogins through meditation; the one Lord of all
  worlds, who removes the fear of worldly existence.
