  Now begins the Fiftieth Chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Releasing from the Serpent-Noose.”
'1': >-
  Then the mighty king of the monkeys, possessed of great splendour and great
  strength, spoke: “What is this—why is this host in such distress, like a boat
  upon the waters when the wind has gone astray?”
'2': >-
  Hearing Sugrīva’s words, Aṅgada, the son of Vāli, said: “Do you not see Rāma
  and Lakṣmaṇa, those great chariot-warriors?”
'3': >-
  Both the heroic sons of Daśaratha, their bodies covered by a net of arrows,
  those great-souled ones, lie upon a couch of shafts, sprinkled with blood.
'4': >-
  Then Sugrīva, lord of the monkeys, said to his son Aṅgada: “I think this is no
  mere accident; it has come to pass by the force of destiny, and fear is upon
  us.”
'5': >-
  For these warriors, their faces cast down, have thrown away their weapons; in
  every direction the monkeys flee in terror, their eyes wide with fright.
'6': >-
  They are not ashamed before one another; they do not look back. They jostle
  and drag one another, and even leap over those who have fallen.
'7': >-
  In the meantime, the hero Vibhīṣaṇa, mace in hand, came forward and encouraged
  Sugrīva and also invoked blessings of victory for Rāghava.
'8': >-
  Seeing Vibhīṣaṇa—who struck fear among the monkeys—Sugrīva spoke to the
  great-souled king of bears, Jāmbavān, who stood near.
'9': >-
  “This Vibhīṣaṇa has arrived; seeing him, the foremost of monkeys run away in
  sudden terror, suspecting him to be Rāvaṇa’s son.”
'10': >-
  “Quickly steady these very frightened monkeys who are running about in many
  directions; tell them that Vibhīṣaṇa has come.”
'11': >-
  Thus addressed by Sugrīva, Jāmbavān, sovereign of the bears, soothed the
  monkeys, turning them back as they fled.
'12': >-
  Having heard the words of the king of bears and seeing Vibhīṣaṇa, all the
  monkeys returned again, their fear cast aside.
'13': >-
  But Vibhīṣaṇa, seeing the limbs of Rāma—pierced and filled with arrows—and
  also those of righteous Lakṣmaṇa, was then greatly afflicted.
'14': >-
  With his hand wet with tears, he wiped the eyes of the two; his mind pressed
  down by sorrow, he wept and lamented.
'15': >-
  “These two, endowed with valour—dauntless, delighting in dear battle—have been
  brought to such a state by the rākṣasas, those deceitful fighters.”
'16': >-
  “By this son of a brother—an evil son, a wicked-souled one—by a rākṣasa of
  crooked intellect, these two of straight prowess have been deceived.”
'17': >-
  “Pierced through by arrows and drenched with blood, these two lie upon the
  earth like a pair of pin-cushions.”
'18': >-
  “Upon whose heroism I had sought my own security—those two bulls among men now
  lie as though asleep, destined for the destruction of their bodies.”
'19': >-
  “Though living, today I am undone; the hope of my kingdom is lost. The enemy
  Rāvaṇa has achieved his vow and has had his desire fulfilled.”
'20': >-
  As he thus lamented, Sugrīva, the valiant king of the monkeys, embraced
  Vibhīṣaṇa and spoke these words.
'21': >-
  “You shall obtain the kingdom in Laṅkā, O knower of dharma—of this there is no
  doubt. Rāvaṇa, together with his son, shall not gain his desire here.”
'22': >-
  “These two, Rāghava and Lakṣmaṇa, supported by Garuḍa, shall cast aside
  delusion and slay Rāvaṇa with all his forces in battle.”
'23': >-
  Having thus consoled and reassured the rākṣasa, Sugrīva then spoke to Suṣeṇa,
  his father-in-law, who stood at his side.
'24': >-
  “Go, taking with you brave troops of monkeys; carry the two brothers Rāma and
  Lakṣmaṇa—those subduers of foes, now bereft of consciousness—to Kiṣkindhā.”
'25': >-
  “But I, having slain Rāvaṇa along with his son and his kinsmen, shall bring
  back Maithilī, as Indra brought back his lost fortune.”
'26': >-
  Hearing these words of the lord of monkeys, Suṣeṇa replied, speaking of an
  ancient great war between the gods and the asuras.
'27': >-
  “In that time the dānavas struck down the gods—those skilled in the touch of
  arrows—shrouding them again and again, though the gods were expert in
  weapons.”
'28': >-
  “Bṛhaspati then treated those afflicted ones—some unconscious, some whose
  lives had departed—by mantra-endowed sciences and by herbs.”
'29': >-
  “Let swift monkeys—Sampāti, Panasa, and others—go quickly with speed to the
  Kṣīroda ocean to bring those herbs.”
'30': >-
  “The monkeys know that on the Pārvatī mountain there are those great herbs:
  the divine Sañjīvakaraṇī and Viśalyā, fashioned by the gods.”
'31': >-
  “In the excellent Kṣīroda ocean there are the mountains named Candra and
  Droṇa; where nectar was churned, there are those supreme herbs.”
'32': >-
  “Those two mountains were placed there by the gods in that great ocean. Let
  Hanumān, the son of the Wind, go there, O King.”
'33': >-
  In the meantime, the Wind rose, and clouds too with lightning, hurling the
  waters of the sea about as though shaking the mountains.
'34': >-
  By the great blast of the wing-wind, the great trees of all the islands, their
  branches broken, fell into the salty waters.
'35': >-
  The serpents dwelling there—the mighty-bodied nāgas—became frightened, and all
  the aquatic beings swiftly went into the salt ocean.
'36': >-
  Then, after a short while, all the monkeys beheld the mighty Vainateya,
  Garuḍa, blazing like fire.
'37': >-
  Seeing him come, those nāgas fled in haste—those by whom the two heroes had
  been bound by the mighty arrows that had become serpents.
'38': >-
  Then the winged one touched the two sons of Kakutstha, greeted them, and
  gently stroked with his hands their faces, radiant like the moon.
'39': >-
  When touched by Vainateya, the wounds of the two closed up; quickly their
  bodies became as though golden and smooth.
'40': >-
  Their splendour, vigour, strength, energy, and ardour—those great qualities—as
  well as their power of manifestation, their intellect, and their memory became
  twofold.
'41': >-
  The radiant Garuḍa raised them up—those two like Vāsava—and joyfully embraced
  them both; and Rāma spoke to him.
'42': >-
  “By your grace, this great calamity arising from Rāvaṇi has been overcome by a
  means, and we have quickly been restored to strength.”
'43': >-
  “Just as, upon meeting my father Daśaratha and my grandsire, my heart is
  gladdened—so too, on attaining you, my heart finds peace.”
'44': >-
  “Who are you, endowed with such form—wearing divine garlands and unguents,
  clad in spotless garments, adorned with heavenly ornaments?”
'45': >-
  To him the mighty, radiant Vainateya—the king of birds—answered, his eyes
  unsteady with delight, his heart filled with joy.
'46': >-
  “I am your friend, O Kakutstha—dear as life, moving outward in freedom. Garuḍa
  has come here for the sake of aiding you two.”
'47': >-
  “Neither the mighty asuras, nor the powerful dānavas, nor even the gods
  together with the gandharvas, led by Śatakratu (Indra),”
'48': >-
  “could have freed this most dreadful bond of shafts—created by the magic power
  of Indrajit, cruel in deed.”
'49': >-
  “These are the nāgas, the sons of Kadru—fierce-fanged, venomous—who, by the
  might of rākṣasa magic, became arrows and laid hold of you.”
'50': >-
  “Fortunate are you, O knower of dharma, Rāma of truthful valour—together with
  your brother Lakṣmaṇa, the slayer of foes in battle.”
'51': >-
  “Hearing this account, I hastened here at once; out of affection for you both,
  I came swiftly, maintaining the bond of friendship.”
'52': >-
  “You have been released from this most terrible bondage of arrows; yet
  constant vigilance must ever be maintained by you both.”
'53': >-
  “By their very nature all rākṣasas are deceitful fighters in battle; but for
  heroes of pure intent like you, straightforwardness itself is strength.”
'54': >-
  “Therefore do not trust the rākṣasas on the battlefield; by this very example
  know that rākṣasas are ever crooked.”
'55': >-
  Having spoken thus to Rāma, that mighty Suparṇa embraced him with great
  affection and then began to take his leave.
'56': >-
  “Friend Rāghava, knower of dharma, compassionate even to enemies—permit me now
  to depart; I shall go at my ease.”
'57': >-
  “Let there be no curiosity regarding this friendship, O Rāghava. Having
  accomplished your deed in battle, O hero, you will understand the return of
  friendship.”
'58': >-
  “Having made Laṅkā—leaving only the young and the old—like a sea of arrows,
  and having slain your foe Rāvaṇa, you shall regain Sītā.”
'59': >-
  So saying, Suparṇa of swift stride made Rāma free from ailment in the midst of
  those forest-dwellers.
'60': >-
  Then, having circumambulated and embraced him, that mighty one entered the sky
  and departed—Suparṇa like the wind.
'61': >-
  Seeing the two Rāghavas free from pain, the leaders of the monkey-troops then
  roared a lion-roar and shook their tails.
'62': >-
  Then they beat the kettledrums and sounded the mṛdaṅgas; delighted, they blew
  conches and shouted, as in their own city.
'63': >-
  Others—the powerful monkeys, fighters upon mountains—tore up diverse trees and
  stood there by the hundreds of thousands.
'64': >-
  Sending forth great roars and terrifying the night-rangers, the monkeys rushed
  to the gates of Laṅkā, eager to fight.
'65': >-
  Terrible and tumultuous was the roar of those leaders of monkey-troops—like
  the dreadful sound of thundering clouds at the close of summer, roaring in the
  middle of the night.
'66': >-
  Thus ends the Fiftieth Chapter, named “The Releasing from the Serpent-Noose,”
  in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
