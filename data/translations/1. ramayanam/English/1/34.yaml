  Now begins the thirty-fourth sarga in the Bālakāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Description of Viśvāmitra’s Lineage.”
'1': >-
  When that Brahmadatta had gone, after his marriage had been duly solemnized, O
  Rāghava, being without a son and desiring to obtain a son, he undertook an
  iṣṭi-sacrifice for the gaining of offspring.
'2': >-
  And while that iṣṭi-sacrifice was in progress, then Kuśa, the exceedingly
  noble son of Brahmā, spoke to Kuśanābha, the king of the earth.
'3': >-
  “A son, like unto yourself—most righteous and virtuous—shall be born to you.
  Through him you shall attain Gādhi, and you shall obtain imperishable fame in
  the world.”
'4': >-
  Having thus spoken, O Rāma, Kuśa addressed Kuśanābha, the king, and then,
  entering the sky, he went to the eternal world of Brahmā.
'5': >-
  After some time had passed, to that wise Kuśanābha there was born a son,
  supremely devoted to dharma, who was known by the name Gādhi.
'6': >-
  That Gādhi, O scion of Kakutstha, was my father, supremely righteous; and I am
  born in the line of Kuśa—I am Kauśika, O delighter of the Raghus.
'7': >-
  And I had also an elder sister, O Rāghava, of excellent vows and conduct,
  named Satyavatī; she was given in marriage to Ṛcīka.
'8': >-
  Faithfully following her husband, she went to heaven in her very body; and
  she, the exceedingly generous one, became the great river called Kauśikī.
'9': >-
  Divine, lovely, and of sacred waters, she took refuge upon Himavān; and for
  the welfare and benefit of the world my sister set forth as a river.
'10': >-
  Therefore I dwell beside Himavān, living with restraint and in comfort, united
  with affection for my sister Kauśikī, O joy of the Raghus.
'11': >-
  That holy Satyavatī—firmly established in truth and in dharma—was a devoted
  wife, greatly fortunate; she is Kauśikī, the best among rivers.
'12': >-
  And I indeed, O Rāma, through observance of my vows, left her and came here;
  having reached Siddhāśrama, I am accomplished through your splendour.
'13': >-
  Thus, O mighty-armed one, my birth and the glory of my own lineage have been
  recounted, as also of the region—since you asked me concerning these matters.
'14': >-
  Half the night has passed, O Kakutstha, while I have been narrating these
  tales. Seek sleep—may auspiciousness be yours—so that no hindrance may arise
  for us on our journey.
'15': >-
  All the trees were motionless; the deer and the birds had withdrawn into
  hiding; and the quarters were pervaded by the darkness of night, O delighter
  of the Raghus.
'16': >-
  Gradually twilight was released; the sky appeared as though covered by eyes;
  and, thick with constellations and stars, it shone with many lights.
'17': >-
  And the moon, cool-rayed and dispelling the world’s darkness, rose up,
  gladdening the hearts of living beings in the world by his own radiance.
'18': >-
  Then nocturnal beings began to roam here and there—hosts of yakṣas and
  rākṣasas, and fierce flesh-eaters.
'19': >-
  Having thus spoken, the great sage of mighty splendour ceased. All the sages
  honoured him, saying, “Well spoken! Well spoken!”
'20': >-
  This line of the Kuśikas is great and ever devoted to dharma; those
  great-souled, best of men, born in Kuśa’s lineage are like unto Brahmā.
'21': >-
  And especially you yourself, O Viśvāmitra of great renown—your river Kauśikī,
  the best among rivers, is the illuminator and glory of your house.
'22': >-
  Thus praised by the delighted tiger-like sages, the illustrious son of Kuśika
  went to sleep, like the sun when he has set.
'23': >-
  Rāma too, together with Saumitri, somewhat filled with wonder, praised that
  tiger among sages and then resorted to sleep.
'24': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fourth sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the first of poems, entitled “The Description of
  Viśvāmitra’s Lineage.”
