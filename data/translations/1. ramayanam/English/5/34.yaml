  Then, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Sundara-kanda, begins the
  thirty-fourth chapter, named “The Removal of Sita’s Doubt that He is Ravana.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words of hers, Hanuman—the foremost of the monkeys—spoke in
  reply, offering consolation to her who was overwhelmed by sorrow upon sorrow.
'2': >-
  “O देवी (noble lady), I have come to you as a messenger, sent by Rama. O
  Vaidehi, Rama is well; he bids you welfare.”
'3': >-
  “He who knows the Brahma-weapon and the Vedas, the best among those who know
  the Vedas—he, Dasarathi Rama, O lady, sends you tidings of welfare.”
'4': >-
  “And Lakshmana also—of great splendour—your dear one, the devoted follower of
  your lord, afflicted with grief, has made obeisance to you with bowed head.”
'5': >-
  Hearing of the welfare of those two lion-like among men, the देवी (Sita)
  became glad in every limb, and then spoke to Hanuman.
'6': >-
  “Auspicious indeed! Yet this tale appears to me like a worldly (ordinary)
  story; joy comes to a living person even after a hundred years.”
'7': >-
  At that meeting of the two, a wondrous joy arose; and trusting one another,
  they began to converse together.
'8': >-
  Hearing her words, Hanuman, the son of the Wind-god, drew nearer to Sita who
  was scorched by grief.
'9': >-
  As Hanuman approached nearer and nearer, so did Sita suspect him more and more
  to be Ravana.
'10': >-
  “Alas! Fie upon this—this that has been spoken by him to me! Assuming another
  form, this indeed is Ravana himself.”
'11': >-
  Letting go of the branch of the Ashoka tree, she—wasted by sorrow—sat down
  upon the very ground there, she of faultless limbs.
'12': >-
  Then the mighty-armed Hanuman paid reverence to that daughter of Janaka. But
  she, frightened, did not look at him again.
'13': >-
  Seeing him bowing, Sita—whose face was like the moon—after a long sigh, spoke
  to the monkey in a sweet voice:
'14': >-
  “If you are Ravana himself, O wielder of illusion, having entered by magical
  power, you again produce torment in me—this is not seemly.”
'15': >-
  “Abandoning your own form, you who wear the guise of a wandering mendicant—at
  Janasthana I saw you; you are that very Ravana indeed.”
'16': >-
  “O night-ranger, assuming forms at will—when I am thin from fasting and
  miserable—if you torment me again and again, that torment is not seemly.”
'17': >-
  “Or else, it is not truly so as I have suspected; for in my heart a gladness
  has arisen at the sight of you.”
'18': >-
  “If you have come as Rama’s messenger, may good betide you. I ask you, O best
  of monkeys, for dear to me is the story of Rama.”
'19': >-
  “Tell me the virtues of Rama, my beloved, O monkey. O gentle one, you steal
  away my heart, as a swift current steals away a river-bank.”
'20': >-
  “Ah, how pleasant is this dream that has long been desired by me—that I see a
  forest-dweller dispatched by Raghava.”
'21': >-
  “If even in a dream I might behold the hero Raghava together with Lakshmana, I
  would not sink in despair; but even my dream is jealous of me.”
'22': >-
  “I do not think this is a dream; for having seen a monkey in a dream,
  prosperity cannot be attained—whereas prosperity has come to me.”
'23': >-
  “What, then, could this delusion of mind be? Could this be the course of the
  wind? Or some transformation born of madness? Or could this be a mirage?”
'24': >-
  “Or else this is not madness, nor is it delusion bearing the marks of madness;
  I clearly recognize both myself and this forest-dweller as well.”
'25': >-
  Thus, reflecting in many ways upon what was strong and what was weak,
  Sita—because rakshasas can assume forms at will—took him to be the lord of the
  rakshasas.
'26': >-
  Having then formed this judgement, Sita of slender waist—the daughter of
  Janaka—did not reply to the monkey.
'27': >-
  Understanding that Sita’s mind had become resolved (in suspicion), Hanuman,
  son of the Wind-god, then sought to gladden her with words pleasing to the
  ear.
'28': >-
  “Radiant like the sun; beloved of the world like the moon; like Kubera
  (Vaishravana), the king, the lord of all the world—
'29': >-
  “Endowed with valour like the illustrious Vishnu; truthful, and sweet of
  speech like the god Brihaspati (lord of speech)—
'30': >-
  “Handsome, fortunate, possessed of splendour, like embodied Kama (the god of
  love); swift to strike in proper place and in righteous wrath; the foremost
  great chariot-warrior in the world—
'31': >-
  “That great-souled one under whose arm’s protection the world
  abides—Raghava—whom you led away from the hermitage-abodes by withdrawing and
  approaching in the form of a deer:
'32': >-
  “You shall behold the fruit of that deed. Ere long you shall see the mighty
  one who will slay Ravana in battle.”
'33': >-
  “With arrows released in wrath, blazing as if with fires—he has sent me as a
  messenger, and thus have I come here into your presence.”
'34': >-
  “Tormented with sorrow by separation from you, he bids you welfare; and
  Lakshmana also—of great splendour, the increaser of Sumitra’s joy—bids you
  welfare.”
'35': >-
  “Having made obeisance, that mighty-armed one bids you welfare. And Rama’s
  friend, O lady, is the monkey named Sugriva—
'36': >-
  “The king of the chief monkeys—he too bids you welfare. Rama ever remembers
  you, together with Sugriva and with Lakshmana.”
'37': >-
  “By good fortune you live, O Vaidehi, though you have come under the power of
  rakshasis. Before long you shall behold Rama and Lakshmana, that great
  chariot-warrior.”
'38': >-
  “Amid crores of monkeys, and Sugriva of immeasurable might— I am Sugriva’s
  minister, a monkey named Hanuman.”
'39': >-
  “Having entered the city of Lanka, having leapt across the great ocean, and
  having set my foot upon the head of evil-souled Ravana—
'40': >-
  “I have come here to see you, relying upon my prowess. I am not, O lady, as
  you take me to be. Let this suspicion be abandoned; trust my words.”
'41': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fourth chapter of the Sundara-kanda in the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Adi-Kavya, named “The Removal of Sita’s Doubt that He is
  Ravana.”
