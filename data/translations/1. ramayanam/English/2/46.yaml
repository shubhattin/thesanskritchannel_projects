  Now begins the forty-sixth chapter of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, renowned and auspicious, entitled “The Deluding of the Citizens.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter Rāghava, taking refuge on the lovely bank of the river Tamasā,
  looked upon Sītā and then spoke these words to Saumitrī (Lakṣmaṇa).
'2': >-
  “This night, Saumitrī, is the first that has been appointed for us in the
  forest. For our dwelling in the woods—may good befall you—you ought not to
  give way to distress or yearning.”
'3': >-
  “Behold these empty wildernesses, as though they were weeping on all sides,
  since the deer and the birds have hidden themselves away, coming in toward
  their usual abodes because of the wind.”
'4': >-
  “Today, indeed, Ayodhyā—the city, my father’s capital—will grieve for us who
  have departed, men and women alike; of this there is no doubt.”
'5': >-
  “For the people are devoted to the king, on account of his many virtues; and
  they are devoted to you and to me as well, O tiger among men, and likewise to
  Śatrughna and Bharata.”
'6': >-
  “I grieve for my father, and for my illustrious mother too. Might it not be
  that those two, again and again, will weep ceaselessly—so that we would be as
  though bereft of sight?”
'7': >-
  “Bharata indeed is righteous-souled; with words in harmony with dharma, artha,
  and kāma he will console my father and my mother.”
'8': >-
  “Reflecting again and again upon Bharata’s compassion and gentleness, O
  mighty-armed one, I do not lament for my father and my mother.”
'9': >-
  “What had to be done by you, O tiger among men, has been done in following
  after me; for help must indeed be sought for the protection of Vaidehī
  (Sītā).”
'10': >-
  “Indeed, Saumitrī, I shall pass this night with water alone. This is what
  pleases me, even though various foods of the forest are available.”
'11': >-
  Having spoken thus to Saumitrī, Rāghava also addressed Sumantra: “Be vigilant,
  gentle one, concerning the horses.”
'12': >-
  Then Sumantra, restraining the horses as the sun had set, provided them with
  abundant barley and fodder, and thereafter remained ready at hand.
'13': >-
  Having duly observed the auspicious twilight worship and seeing that night had
  arrived, the charioteer prepared a resting-place for Rāma, together with
  Saumitrī.
'14': >-
  Seeing that bed on the bank of the Tamasā, covered with the leaves of trees,
  Rāma, along with Saumitrī and with his wife, lay down there.
'15': >-
  Seeing Rāma—together with his wife—fallen asleep and wearied, Lakṣmaṇa spoke
  to the charioteer, recounting Rāma’s many virtues.
'16': >-
  While Saumitrī remained awake through that night and while the charioteer on
  the bank of the Tamasā spoke of Rāma’s virtues, the sun arose.
'17': >-
  At a distance from the Tamasā’s bank, crowded with cowherd settlements, Rāma
  passed that night there together with the men devoted to him (his attendants
  and followers).
'18': >-
  Rising up, the great and radiant Rāma observed those attendants, and then
  spoke to his brother Lakṣmaṇa, endowed with auspicious marks.
'19': >-
  “Look now, Lakṣmaṇa: dependent upon us, Saumitrī, and yet free from
  self-interest even in their own homes, they are attached to us and are lying
  about at the roots of trees.”
'20': >-
  “In the manner in which these citizens are keeping their resolve concerning
  our return, they would even lay down their lives, but they would not abandon
  their determination.”
'21': >-
  “So long as they are asleep, for just so long should we swiftly mount the
  chariot and proceed along a path that is free from peril from any side.”
'22': >-
  “Thus, no more should the inhabitants of Ikṣvāku’s city—so devoted—sleep now,
  taking shelter at the roots of trees.”
'23': >-
  “For the citizens should be released from the sorrow they have brought upon
  themselves on account of the princes; indeed, the townspeople ought not to be
  joined to sorrow by our own doing.”
'24': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa spoke to Rāma—who stood like Dharma embodied before him—“So it seems
  good to me as well, O wise one: let us mount quickly.”
'25': >-
  Then Rāma said to the charioteer, “Harness the chariot quickly. From here I
  shall go to the forest. Go swiftly, sir.”
'26': >-
  Then the charioteer, hastening, yoked Rāma’s chariot with those excellent
  horses, and with joined palms reported back.
'27': >-
  “This chariot is harnessed, O mighty-armed one, best of chariot-warriors.
  Mount quickly—good befall you—with Sītā and with Lakṣmaṇa.”
'28': >-
  Mounting that chariot, Rāghava—together with his equipment and
  attendants—crossed the river Tamasā, swift-flowing and full of eddies and
  whirlpools.
'29': >-
  Having crossed, the mighty-armed and glorious one reached the great
  highway—auspicious and free from hindrance—one that is fearless for those who
  perceive dangers.
'30': >-
  But for the purpose of deluding the citizens, Rāma spoke these words to the
  charioteer: “Proceed facing north, O charioteer, having mounted the chariot.”
'31': >-
  “After going swiftly for a short while, turn the chariot back again, so that
  the citizens may not know my whereabouts. Do thus, attentive and composed.”
'32': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s command, the charioteer acted accordingly; returning, he
  reported the chariot’s position and movement to Rāma.
'33': >-
  Then those two—Rāma and Sītā, enhancers of the Raghu line—having mounted the
  well-harnessed chariot, the charioteer urged on the horses along the path that
  led to the grove of ascetics (the forest hermitage).
'34': >-
  Thereafter the mighty chariot-warrior, Daśaratha’s son, set forth to the
  forest with his charioteer. And he caused the chariot to proceed facing north,
  because the sight of that direction was an auspicious omen for their
  departure.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the forty-sixth chapter of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Deluding of the
  Citizens.”
