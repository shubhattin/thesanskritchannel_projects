'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-second chapter, named “The Slaying of Dhūmrākṣa.”
'1': >-
  Beholding Dhūmrākṣa— the rākṣasa of dreadful prowess—going forth to battle,
  all the vānaras raised loud cries, delighted and eager for the fight.
'2': >-
  Then a most tumultuous battle arose between the monkey-hosts and the rākṣasas,
  as they struck one another fiercely with terrible trees, and with spears and
  maces.
'3': >-
  On all sides the dreadful vānaras were hewn down by the rākṣasas; and the
  rākṣasas too were crushed level with the ground by the vānaras with trees.
'4': >-
  The rākṣasas, enraged, pierced the vānaras with sharp arrows—terrible to
  behold—having vulture-feathered shafts and flying straight.
'5': >-
  Armed with fearful clubs, with axes, with heavy mallets, with dreadful and
  varied iron bars, and with tridents as well, they pressed on in the fight.
'6': >-
  Though their bodies were being torn by the rākṣasas, those mighty
  vānaras—roused by a surge born of intolerant wrath—performed deeds without
  fear.
'7': >-
  Though their limbs were split by arrows and their bodies pierced by spears,
  those leaders of the monkey-troops seized there great trees and rocks.
'8': >-
  Those swift and terrible vānaras, roaring again and again, crushed the heroic
  rākṣasas and shouted out names aloud.
'9': >-
  That battle between vānaras and rākṣasas became wondrous and dreadful—thick
  with many kinds of rocks and with many-branched trees.
'10': >-
  Some rākṣasas were crushed by the vānaras with victorious blows; and
  some—blood-eaters—vomited forth blood from their mouths.
'11': >-
  Some had their flanks torn open; some were heaped together under fallen trees;
  some were pulverized by rocks; and some were ripped apart by the teeth (of the
  vānaras).
'12': >-
  Some of the night-roamers were afflicted as their banners were shattered and
  broken, their swords struck down, and their chariots smashed to pieces.
'13': >-
  The face of the earth was strewn with great elephants, mountain-like, and with
  the peaks of mountains (hurled by the forest-dwellers), and with horses
  crushed—together with their riders.
'14': >-
  The rākṣasas were leapt upon by the vānaras of dreadful valor—springing up and
  leaping again with speed—and their faces were torn by sharp nails.
'15': >-
  Again and again, with downcast faces and hair disheveled, bewildered by the
  smell of blood, they fell upon the ground.
'16': >-
  Others, however—rākṣasas of terrible prowess—furious beyond measure, rushed
  upon the vānaras using their palms alone, whose blows were like the touch of a
  thunderbolt.
'17': >-
  Yet those rākṣasas, as they ran and struck, were beaten down by vānaras
  swifter still—pounded with fists and feet and teeth, and battered with trees.
'18': >-
  Seeing his army in flight, Dhūmrākṣa, bull among rākṣasas, in wrath wrought
  great slaughter among the vānaras who sought battle.
'19': >-
  Some vānaras, struck and mangled by javelins, streamed with blood; some,
  smitten by maces, fell upon the ground.
'20': >-
  Some were crushed by iron bars; some were torn by bhindipālas (heavy darts);
  some were battered by axes—reeling and bereft of life.
'21': >-
  Some forest-dwellers lay slain upon the earth, drenched in blood; some were
  driven away and scattered, lost in the combat by the enraged rākṣasas.
'22': >-
  Some had their hearts split; some lay on one side; some were torn open by
  tridents, their entrails spilling forth.
'23': >-
  That exceedingly dreadful and vast battle—crowded with vānaras and
  rākṣasas—shone forth, filled with weapons and thronged with rocks and trees.
'24': >-
  With the sweet twang of bowstrings as its music, accompanied by the rhythm of
  panting and the beat of blows, and with the low rumble as its song, that
  combat appeared like a gāndharva-performance (celestial music) of war.
'25': >-
  Then Dhūmrākṣa, bow in hand, laughing upon the forefront of battle, drove the
  vānaras away in all directions with showers of arrows.
'26': >-
  Beholding the host harried and shaken by Dhūmrākṣa, Māruti (Hanumān) returned
  to the fight in anger, seizing a विशाल (mighty) rock.
'27': >-
  Hanumān, whose coppery hue seemed doubled by rage, and whose valor was like
  his father’s, hurled that rock toward Dhūmrākṣa’s chariot.
'28': >-
  Seeing the rock rushing down, Dhūmrākṣa, in agitation, lifted his mace and,
  leaping swiftly from the chariot, took his stand upon the earth.
'29': >-
  That rock, smashing his chariot, fell to the ground—(breaking it) along with
  its wheels and yoke-pole, with its horses, with its banner, and with its bow.
'30': >-
  Having shattered his chariot, Hanumān, son of the Wind-god, wrought slaughter
  among the rākṣasas with trees having trunks and branches.
'31': >-
  Their heads split asunder, the rākṣasas—sprinkled with blood—fell to the
  earth; and others too, crushed by trees, dropped upon the ground.
'32': >-
  After routing the rākṣasa army, Hanumān, son of the Wind-god, tore up a
  mountain-peak and rushed straight at Dhūmrākṣa.
'33': >-
  Seeing him coming, Dhūmrākṣa, mighty and valorous, lifting his mace and
  roaring aloud, suddenly charged at Hanumān.
'34': >-
  In fury and rage, Dhūmrākṣa brought down that mace—studded with many
  spikes—upon Hanumān’s head.
'35': >-
  Struck there by that mace of dreadful speed, that monkey endowed with the
  Wind’s might paid no heed to the blow.
'36': >-
  Then he hurled the mountain-peak upon the middle of Dhūmrākṣa’s head; and, all
  his limbs stretched wide, Dhūmrākṣa was smitten by the mountain-crest.
'37': >-
  He suddenly fell to the ground, like a mountain shattered and scattered.
  Seeing Dhūmrākṣa slain, the remaining night-roamers, terrified, fled into
  Laṅkā, being slain as they ran by the plavaṅgamas (vānaras).
'38': >-
  But the son of the Wind, having slain the foes and strewn about streams
  flowing with blood, that great-souled one—wearied by the exertion born of
  enemy-slaying—rejoiced, being duly honored by the vānaras.
'39': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-second chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the revered,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Slaying of
  Dhūmrākṣa.”
