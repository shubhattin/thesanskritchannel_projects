  Now begins the seventieth canto in the Aranya-kanda of the blessed
  Valmiki-Ramayana, called “The Cutting Off of Kabandha’s Arms.”
'1': >-
  Seeing those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, standing there, their bodies
  bound fast in the noose of his arms, Kabandha spoke these words:
'2': >-
  “Why do you both stand thus, O best of Kshatriyas, after seeing me here,
  tormented by hunger? Surely, by destiny you have been sent as my food, your
  senses struck down and your wits confounded.”
'3': >-
  Hearing those words, timely and well-meant for that moment, Lakshmana—overcome
  with distress, yet firm in his resolve for valor—spoke:
'4': >-
  “Formerly this basest of rakshasas swiftly seized both you and me. Therefore,
  with our swords let us quickly cut off his mighty arms.”
'5': >-
  “This fearsome, huge-bodied rakshasa is powerful in his arms. Having conquered
  all the world, as it were, he now desires to slay us here.”
'6': >-
  “To kill those who are powerless and unable to act is disgraceful, O king, O
  lord of the earth—like the slaughter of animals brought to the midst of a
  sacrifice, O Raghava.”
'7': >-
  Hearing this speech between them, the rakshasa, enraged, tore open his
  dreadful mouth and then began to set about devouring the two.
'8': >-
  Then the two Raghavas, knowing well the place and the time, and greatly
  exhilarated, with their very swords cut off his arms at the shoulder-joints.
'9': >-
  Rama, with speed, severed the right arm with his sword, and the heroic
  Lakshmana cut off the left.
'10': >-
  That great-armed one, his arms cut off, fell down with a tremendous roar,
  resounding through the sky, the earth, and all the quarters, like a cloud
  thundering.
'11': >-
  Seeing his two arms hewn off, and drenched in a flood of blood, the demon,
  wretched, asked those two heroes, “Who are you both?”
'12': >-
  As he spoke thus, Lakshmana of auspicious marks, mighty in strength, declared
  to him the descendant of Kakutstha—Rama—to Kabandha.
'13': >-
  “This is Rama, famed among men, the heir of Ikshvaku. And know me to be his
  younger brother, Lakshmana.”
'14': >-
  “When the kingdom was obstructed by our mother, Rama was banished to the
  forest. Together with me, and with his wife, he now traverses this great
  wilderness.”
'15': >-
  “While this one of divine prowess was dwelling in a solitary forest, his wife
  was carried off by a rakshasa. Seeking her, we have come here.”
'16': >-
  “But who are you, and for what reason do you roam in the forest, resembling
  Kabandha—your chest blazing like a mouth, your thighs broken, and yet you move
  about?”
'17': >-
  Thus addressed by Lakshmana, Kabandha replied in words; pleased, and
  remembering the words once spoken by Indra, he said:
'18': >-
  “Welcome to you both, O tigers among men! By good fortune I behold you. And by
  good fortune have these arm-bonds of mine been cut off by you two.”
'19': >-
  “And as for this distorted form of mine—how it came upon me through
  misconduct—hear from me, O tiger among men, as I tell you the truth in full.”
'20': >-
  Thus ends the seventieth canto in the Aranya-kanda of the revered
  Valmiki-Ramayana, the first epic, called “The Cutting Off of Kabandha’s Arms.”
