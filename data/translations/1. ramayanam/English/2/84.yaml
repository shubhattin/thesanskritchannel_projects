  Now begins the eighty-fourth sarga, named “Guhā’s Coming,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the blessed Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.

  Then, seeing that the army had encamped, having taken shelter along the river
  Gaṅgā, the king of the Niṣādas, at once beholding his kinsmen, spoke
  hurriedly.
'2': >-
  “This host is vast; it appears like the ocean itself. Even when I ponder in my
  mind, I cannot comprehend its end.”
'3': >-
  “And as for Bharata—how, indeed, has he come with evil intent? There he is: of
  mighty stature, on a chariot bearing a banner marked with the kovidāra tree.”
'4': >-
  “Will he bind the boatmen, or will he slay us? And will he seize Rāma, the son
  of Daśaratha, banished from the kingdom by his father?”
'5': >-
  “Seeking to obtain that prosperity of this king (Rāma)—so difficult to
  attain—Bharata, Kaikeyī’s son, comes with the purpose of killing him.”
'6': >-
  “Rāma, Daśaratha’s son, is to me both lord and friend. For his sake we are
  armed and arrayed here on the bank of the Gaṅgā; remain stationed!”
'7': >-
  “Let all the boatmen stay posted along the river Gaṅgā, equipped with strength
  to guard the river—living on meat, roots, and fruits.”
'8': >-
  “Let there be five hundred boats; and a hundred and a hundred fishermen, duly
  armed—likewise the young men—let them remain ready!”—thus he urgently
  commanded.
'9': >-
  “When Bharata, being pleased, is here in accord with Rāma, then this
  auspicious army shall cross the Gaṅgā today.”
'10': >-
  Having spoken thus, taking gifts—fish, meat, and honey—Guha, the lord of the
  Niṣādas, set out toward Bharata.
'11': >-
  Seeing him approaching, the valiant son of the charioteer (Sumantra) informed
  Bharata, speaking with humility and in a properly respectful manner.
'12': >-
  “Here is Guha, the chief, surrounded by a thousand of his kinsmen—safe and
  well—an old friend of your brother, in the Daṇḍaka forest.”
'13': >-
  “Therefore, O Kakutstha, let the Niṣāda lord Guha see you; without doubt he
  knows where those two, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, are.”
'14': >-
  Hearing these auspicious words from Sumantra, Bharata swiftly said, “Let Guha
  see me.”
'15': >-
  Having obtained permission, rejoicing, and surrounded by his kinsmen, Guha
  approached Bharata, bowed low, and spoke these words.
'16': >-
  “This place is secluded, and we too have been wronged (deceived). We all make
  this known to you: dwell in your own boatmen’s community (among us).”
'17': >-
  “There are roots and fruits brought by the Niṣādas; and meat as well—both
  moist and dried—wild fare, abundant, of many kinds, high and low.”
'18': >-
  “I hope that your army, having eaten its fill, will pass this night here.
  Having been honoured with various provisions, tomorrow you shall go forth with
  your forces.”
'19': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-fourth sarga, named “Guhā’s Coming,” in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa
  of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
