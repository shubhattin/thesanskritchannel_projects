  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, begins the seventy-sixth
  sarga, called “The Humbling of Jāmadagnya (Paraśurāma).”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of Jāmadagnya, the son of Daśaratha (Śrī Rāma) then,
  restrained in speech out of reverence, thereafter spoke to his father.
'2': >-
  “That deed which you have done, O Bhārgava, I have heard of. We seek to act in
  accordance with it, O Brāhmaṇa, standing firm in discharging our debt of duty
  to our father.”
'3': >-
  “As though I were without valor, as though I were incapable—O Bhārgava—you
  disdain my might, with a kṣatriya’s code as your measure. Behold today my
  prowess!”
'4': >-
  Having spoken thus, the Rāghava, angered, seized from Bhārgava’s hand the
  excellent weapon—the arrow—he whose prowess was swift.
'5': >-
  Then Rāma fitted the arrow upon the bow and made it taut; and thereafter Rāma,
  wrathful, addressed that Rāma of Jāmadagni thus.
'6': >-
  “Because you are a Brāhmaṇa, you are worthy of my worship; and also for the
  sake of Viśvāmitra. Therefore, O Rāma, I am not able to release at you this
  life-destroying arrow.”
'7': >-
  “Yet my resolve is this: either I shall strike down this course of yours, O
  Rāma, or else those incomparable worlds won by your austerities.”
'8': >-
  “For this divine Vaiṣṇava arrow—conqueror of enemy strongholds—does not fall
  fruitless; by its potency it destroys the pride of strength and valor.”
'9': >-
  To behold Rāma bearing the excellent weapon, the hosts of ṛṣis and the devas
  assembled there from all sides, with the Grandsire Brahmā at their head.
'10': >-
  Gandharvas and Apsarases, Siddhas, Cāraṇas and Kinnaras, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas and
  Nāgas too—all gathered to witness that great marvel.
'11': >-
  When the whole world stood as if stupefied, and Rāma held the mighty bow, that
  Jāmadagnya—his vigor drained away—looked upon Rāma.
'12': >-
  Bereft of his former power by the radiance (of Rāma), Jāmadagnya became as one
  benumbed; and, gazing at lotus-eyed Rāma, he spoke slowly, slowly.
'13': >-
  “When formerly I gave the earth to Kaśyapa, Kaśyapa said to me, ‘You must not
  dwell within my domain.’”
'14': >-
  “So I, obeying my guru’s word, do not stay upon the earth by night; from that
  time onward, O son of Kakutstha, this has been the command laid upon me by
  Kaśyapa.”
'15': >-
  “Therefore, O hero Rāghava, you ought not to destroy this course of mine. I
  shall go, swift as thought, to Mahendra—the best of mountains.”
'16': >-
  “The incomparable worlds have been conquered by me through austerity, O Rāma.
  Strike those with this foremost of arrows, lest there be a reversal ordained
  by Time.”
'17': >-
  “I know you to be the imperishable slayer of Madhu, the Lord of the gods. By
  the mere laying of hand upon this bow, may auspiciousness be yours, O scorcher
  of foes.”
'18': >-
  “All these hosts of gods, gathered here, behold you—of incomparable deeds,
  without an equal in battle.”
'19': >-
  “And this, O son of Kakutstha, should not be a cause of shame to me—that I
  have been turned away by you, the Lord of the three worlds.”
'20': >-
  “Release, O Rāma, this matchless arrow, O you of excellent vows. At the
  releasing of the arrow I shall depart to Mahendra, the best of mountains.”
'21': >-
  As Jāmadagnya spoke thus, the illustrious, mighty Daśarathi Rāma discharged
  that supreme arrow.
'22': >-
  Seeing his own worlds, won by austerity, struck down by Rāma, Jāmadagnya
  swiftly departed to Mahendra, the best of mountains.
'23': >-
  Then all the directions and intermediate quarters became free of darkness; and
  the gods, together with the hosts of ṛṣis, praised Rāma, wielder of the great
  weapon.
'24': >-
  Jāmadagnya Rāma, having honored Daśarathi Rāma, then circumambulated him and
  departed to his own destined course, that puissant one.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-sixth sarga, called “The Humbling of Jāmadagnya,” in the
  Bāla-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
