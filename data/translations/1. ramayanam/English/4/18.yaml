  Now, in the illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the
  Eighteenth Sarga, entitled “The Justification of Vāli’s Slaying.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed with harsh words by Vāli—(Vāli) being slain and his mind
  confounded—Rāma replied with speech that was gentle, salutary, and consonant
  with both dharma and artha (righteousness and polity).
'2': >-
  That foremost of monkeys—his splendour dimmed like the sun when veiled, like a
  cloud emptied of water, and like fire that has been quenched—having uttered
  his words, became calm.
'3': >-
  Then Rāma, though endowed with the excellences of dharma and artha, spoke
  thereafter to Vāli, the unsurpassed lord of the monkeys, who had (just now)
  been reproaching him.
'4': >-
  “Not knowing dharma, artha, kāma, and also the common worldly conventions—how
  is it that, from mere childishness, you censure me here today?”
'5': >-
  “Without first asking wise elders—men held to be teachers and authorities—how
  is it, O gentle one, that through monkeyish fickleness you desire to speak to
  me in this manner?”
'6': >-
  “This earth, with its mountains, forests, and groves, belongs to the Ikṣvāku
  lineage, and (they exercise) restraint and favour even towards deer, birds,
  and men.”
'7': >-
  “The righteous Bharata—truthful and upright—protects it, knowing the true
  principles of dharma, kāma, and artha, and devoted to both chastisement and
  grace.”
'8': >-
  “In whom both policy (naya) and humility/discipline (vinaya) abide, and in
  whom truth stands firmly established; and whose valour is evident as has been
  seen—he is a king who knows place and time.”
'9': >-
  “Under his commands, founded upon dharma, we and other kings traverse the
  whole earth, desiring the continuance and preservation of dharma.”
'10': >-
  “When that tiger among kings—Bharata, fond of dharma—protects the entire
  earth, who would act contrary to dharma?”
'11': >-
  “Therefore we, abiding in our own highest duty, restrain in due manner those
  who have strayed from the path, keeping Bharata’s command in the forefront.”
'12': >-
  “But you are one whose dharma has become tainted, and whose conduct is
  blameworthy; you are driven chiefly by the sway of desire, and do not stand on
  the path proper to kings.”
'13': >-
  “An elder brother, a father, and he who bestows learning—these three are to be
  known as fathers, walking on the path of dharma.”
'14': >-
  “Likewise, a younger brother’s son and also a worthy disciple—these three too
  are to be regarded as sons; and dharma itself is the cause (for such regard)
  here.”
'15': >-
  “Subtle and exceedingly hard to know is the dharma of the virtuous, O
  plavaṅgama; the Self, seated in the hearts of all beings, knows what is
  auspicious and inauspicious.”
'16': >-
  “Fickle yourself, consorting with fickle monkeys of uncontrolled nature, like
  one blind from birth taking counsel with the congenitally blind—what indeed do
  you discern?”
'17': >-
  “But I shall speak to you the clear meaning of this matter: you are not fit to
  censure me merely out of anger.”
'18': >-
  “See then this cause for which you have been slain by me: abandoning the
  eternal dharma, you have been living with your brother’s wife.”
'19': >-
  “While your righteous, great-souled brother Sugrīva yet lives, you—doer of
  sinful deeds—out of lust live with Rumā, your own daughter-in-law.”
'20': >-
  “Therefore, since you have departed from dharma, being governed by desire, O
  monkey, for this act of violating your brother’s wife, this punishment has
  been inflicted.”
'21': >-
  “For one who acts against the world (public morality) and has fallen away from
  established custom, I see no restraint other than punishment, O leader of
  monkey-troops.”
'22': >-
  “Nor do I forgive your sin; I am a kṣatriya born of a noble line: that man
  who, out of lust, approaches his own born sister, or the wife of his younger
  brother—”
'23': >-
  “—for him punishment is enjoined as death. Bharata is the protector of the
  earth, and we are those who act in accordance with his command.”
'24': >-
  “And since you have transgressed dharma, how can you be overlooked? A wise
  man, protecting by means of dharma, cannot disregard one who has violated the
  guru’s law (the higher moral code).”
'25': >-
  “Bharata is firmly established in restraining those who are driven by desire;
  and we, having set Bharata’s command as our limit, O lord of monkeys, are
  resolved to restrain those like you who have broken the bounds of propriety.”
'26': >-
  “And my friendship with Sugrīva—just as (my bond) with Lakṣmaṇa—together with
  the cause connected with wife and kingdom, is for me a means leading to the
  highest good.”
'27': >-
  “And a pledge was given by me then, in the presence of the monkeys; and how
  can a pledge, by one such as I, be left unregarded?”
'28': >-
  “Therefore, for all these weighty reasons, grounded in dharma, the
  chastisement of you which is proper—let that be assented to by you.”
'29': >-
  “In every way your restraint is to be seen as dharma alone; one must aid a
  friend while keeping dharma in view.”
'30': >-
  “That too could have been done by you, following dharma alone. Two verses,
  cherished for right conduct, are heard as sung by Manu; they are accepted by
  those skilled in dharma—and that conduct has been adopted by me as well.”
'31': >-
  “Men who have committed sins, being punished by kings who uphold the rod of
  chastisement, become pure and go to heaven—like good men possessed of merit.”
'32': >-
  “Whether through punishment or even through release (after punishment), a
  thief is freed from sin; but a king who does not punish a sinner truly incurs
  guilt.”
'33': >-
  “By my noble ancestor Māndhātṛ, a terrible calamity was once sought (to be
  averted/encountered) in the case of a sin committed by an ascetic; just so is
  the sin committed by you.”
'34': >-
  “Sins done by other kings too, when negligent, are expiated by acts of
  atonement; thereby that dust (of sin) is cleansed away.”
'35': >-
  “Therefore, enough of remorse. This slaying, ordained in accordance with
  dharma, has been determined; we are not acting by our own mere will.”
'36': >-
  “Hear yet another reason besides, O best of monkeys; having heard it, O mighty
  one, you ought not to give way to great wrath.”
'37': >-
  “In this matter, O best of monkeys, there is for me neither anguish of mind
  nor anger: with nets and snares and many kinds of devices men—”
'38': >-
  “—hidden or in open sight—seize very many beasts: those running, those
  frightened, those trusting, and those that remain still.”
'39': >-
  “Whether heedless or not heedless, men who greatly desire flesh strike them;
  they strike even those turned away, and in this there is held to be no fault.”
'40': >-
  “And here, royal sages also, skilled in dharma, engage in the hunt. Therefore,
  O monkey, you have been slain by me in battle with an arrow, whether you
  fought back or did not fight—because you are but a tree-dwelling beast.”
'41': >-
  “Kings, O foremost of monkeys, are indeed the bestowers of rare dharma and of
  auspicious life—of this there is no doubt.”
'42': >-
  “They should not be harmed, nor reviled, nor reproached, nor spoken to
  unpleasantly; these (kings) are gods moving upon the earth in human form.”
'43': >-
  “But you, not understanding dharma, taking refuge only in anger, revile me in
  regard to dharma, though I stand established in the ancestral and forefathers’
  path.”
'44': >-
  Thus spoken to by Rāma, Vālī was greatly pained; having ascertained dharma, he
  perceived no fault in Rāghava.
'45': >-
  Then the lord of monkeys, with hands joined in reverence, replied to Rāma:
  “What you have said, O best of men, is indeed exactly so—without doubt.”
'46': >-
  “For an inferior cannot answer back to one who is superior. Whatever improper
  and unpleasant speech I spoke earlier through heedlessness—”
'47': >-
  “—even in that, O Rāghava, you ought not to fasten blame on me; for you are
  one who knows the truth of things as they are, devoted to the welfare of
  beings, and whose mind—unfailing and serene—is set upon rightly discerning
  what is to be done and what is not.”
'48': >-
  “Me also—known to have fallen away from dharma and set on
  transgression—protect, O knower of dharma, with words consonant with dharma.”
'49': >-
  Then Vālī, his throat choked with tears, and his voice filled with distress,
  slowly spoke while looking at Rāma—like an elephant sunk in mire.
'50': >-
  “I do not grieve for myself, nor for Tārā, nor even for my kinsmen, as I
  grieve for my son—foremost in virtues—Aṅgada, whose limbs are like gold.”
'51': >-
  “Bereft of my sight, he will become wretched; cherished from childhood, he
  will wither away like a pond whose waters have been drunk dry, going to
  desiccation.”
'52': >-
  “He is but a boy, of unformed understanding, and my only son, dear to me;
  Aṅgada, son of Tārā—O Rāma—possessed of great strength, must be protected by
  you.”
'53': >-
  “Establish an excellent counsel regarding Sugrīva and Aṅgada as well; for you
  are both protector and ruler, firmly grounded in the discernment of what
  should be done and what should not.”
'54': >-
  “Whatever conduct you maintain, O lord of men, toward Bharata and toward
  Lakṣmaṇa—toward Sugrīva and Aṅgada also, O king, you ought to keep that in
  mind.”
'55': >-
  “Let not Sugrīva despise that ascetic-minded Tārā, who has become blameworthy
  due to my fault; you ought to see that she remains duly honoured.”
'56': >-
  “For with your favour, it is possible to enjoy and hold the kingdom—if he
  remains under your control and follows your intent.”
'57': >-
  “It is possible to win heaven and also to govern the earth. I, desiring death
  at your hands, came to single combat with my brother Sugrīva, though Tārā
  tried to restrain me.”
'58': >-
  Having said thus, the monkey-lord ceased speaking to Rāma, having come to the
  duel-fight with his brother Sugrīva.
'59': >-
  Rāma then consoled Vālī, whose vision was clear (and who now understood), with
  words approved by the virtuous, joined to the truth of dharma and its meaning.
'60': >-
  “No anguish should be yours on this account, O plavaṅgama. You need not be
  anxious about us, nor even about yourself, O best of monkeys. Concerning you
  in particular, we have reached a decision grounded in dharma.”
'61': >-
  “He who inflicts punishment upon one worthy of punishment, and he who is
  punished as worthy of punishment—both, in accomplishing what is cause and what
  is effect (right order), do not fall into ruin.”
'62': >-
  “Therefore, by this contact with punishment, you are cleansed of sin; you have
  attained your own natural state consonant with dharma, by the path enjoined by
  chastisement.”
'63': >-
  “Cast away grief and delusion and the fear seated in your heart. O foremost of
  monkeys, what is ordained for you cannot be overstepped.”
'64': >-
  “As Aṅgada is ever devoted to you, O lord of monkeys, so will he be devoted to
  Sugrīva and to me also—of this there is no doubt.”
'65': >-
  Hearing the sweet speech of that great-souled Rāma—composed, following the
  path of dharma—Rāma, the subduer in battle, the monkey spoke in return words
  that were well-reasoned.
'66': >-
  “Because my mind was tormented by the arrow, I spoke to you, O lord, in
  ignorance. O king of men—you whose dreadful valour is like great Indra’s—being
  now propitiated, forgive me.”
'67': >-
  Thus ends the Eighteenth Sarga, entitled “The Justification of Vāli’s
  Slaying,” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the
  Ādi-kāvya.
