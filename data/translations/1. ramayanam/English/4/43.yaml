  Now begins the forty-third chapter, called “The Dispatch to the Northern
  Quarter,” in the Kishkindhā Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Thereupon Sugrīva, the lord of the vānaras, having given instructions to his
  father-in-law for the western quarter, then addressed the heroic vānara named
  Śatabali.
'2': >-
  That king—knowing all things, and the foremost among all vānaras—then spoke
  words that were beneficial to himself and likewise beneficial to Rāma.
'3': >-
  “Surrounded by a hundred thousand forest-dwellers like you, together with the
  sons of Vaivasvata (the Lord of Death), and with all the ministers, you shall
  set forth.”
'4': >-
  “Search in every way the northern direction—abounding in valour, adorned with
  the snowy Himālaya ranges—for Rāma’s illustrious consort.”
'5': >-
  “When this task is accomplished, when what is dear to the son of Daśaratha has
  been done, we shall be freed from our debt—fulfilled in our purpose, we who
  are foremost among those who understand what is needful.”
'6': >-
  “For the great-souled Rāghava has done what is dear to us; if there can be any
  requital to him, then indeed our life will become fruitful.”
'7': >-
  “If one, though not the doer of a deed, strives for the accomplishment of
  another’s object, his very birth becomes successful; how much more so in the
  case of one who repays a benefactor of earlier kindness!”
'8': >-
  “Keeping this resolve firmly—so that Jānakī may be seen—thus must you act, you
  who seek what is dear and beneficial to me.”
'9': >-
  “For Rāma, the best of men, is worthy of honour from all beings; and he, the
  conqueror of hostile cities, has come to cherish affection for us.”
'10': >-
  “Many are the difficult strongholds, rivers, and interposing mountain tracts
  there; let yourselves search them, endowed with intelligence and prowess.”
'11': >-
  “There you shall look among the Mlecchas, the Pulindas, the Śūrasenas, and
  likewise the Prasthalas; among the Bharatas too, and the Kurus together with
  the Madrakas.”
'12': >-
  “You shall also examine the regions of the Kāmbojas and the Yavanas, and the
  towns of the Śakas; and having sought the Daradas as well, you shall explore
  the Himavant.”
'13': >-
  “In thickets of lodhra and padmaka trees, and in forests of deodars, Rāvaṇa
  together with the princess of Videha must be searched for, again and again, in
  every place.”
'14': >-
  “Then, having gone to Soma’s hermitage, frequented by gods and gandharvas, you
  shall proceed to the great-peaked mountain named Kāla.”
'15': >-
  “On that mountain—upon its great cliffs and ridges, and in its caves—search
  for the illustrious and blameless consort of Rāma.”
'16': >-
  “Having passed beyond that lord of mountains, the mighty peak with a womb of
  gold, you should thereafter go to the mountain called Sudarśana.”
'17': >-
  “Then comes the mountain named Devasakha, a resort of birds, thronged with
  many kinds of winged creatures and adorned with diverse trees.”
'18': >-
  “In its groves, its waterfalls, and its caves, Rāvaṇa together with the
  princess of Videha must be searched for, again and again, in every place.”
'19': >-
  “Having crossed beyond it, you will reach a sky-like expanse stretching a
  hundred yojanas on every side—without mountains, rivers, or trees, and devoid
  of all living beings.”
'20': >-
  “But having swiftly passed beyond that wilderness that makes the hair stand on
  end, you will reach pale-white Kailāsa, and you will be filled with joy.”
'21': >-
  “There is the delightful mansion of Kubera, resembling a pale cloud,
  embellished with Jāmbūnada gold, and constructed by Viśvakarmā.”
'22': >-
  “There lies a broad lotus-lake, rich with lotuses and waterlilies, crowded
  with swans and kāraṇḍavas, and attended by hosts of apsarases.”
'23': >-
  “There the king Vaiśravaṇa, honoured by all the worlds, the illustrious lord
  of yakṣas, the giver of wealth, sports together with the Guhyakas.”
'24': >-
  “In those moonlike mountains, and in their caves too, Rāvaṇa together with the
  princess of Videha must be searched for, again and again, in every place.”
'25': >-
  “Then, reaching the Krauñca mountain, you must enter its exceedingly
  inaccessible cavern; only the vigilant should go in, for it is famed to be
  hard to enter.”
'26': >-
  “For there dwell great-souled sages, radiant like the sun, duly entreated by
  the gods—great seers in the very form of gods.”
'27': >-
  “Moreover, the other caves of Krauñca, its slopes, its peaks, its clefts, and
  its ridges must be examined, again and again, in every place.”
'28': >-
  “There is also the treeless Kāmaśaila and the Mānas lake, a resort of birds;
  no beings have passage there—neither even the gods, nor the rākṣasas.”
'29': >-
  “That region too must be examined in full, with its slopes and foothills; and
  having crossed beyond Krauñca mountain, there is the peak named Maināka.”
'30': >-
  “There stands the self-made mansion of the dānava Maya; and Maināka must be
  searched, with its slopes, foothills, and caverns.”
'31': >-
  “There and there are the abodes of mare-faced women; having passed beyond that
  land, you shall go on to an āśrama frequented by siddhas.”
'32': >-
  “There dwell perfected beings—Vaikhānasas and Vālakhilya ascetics; those
  siddhas, purified of sin by austerity, should be revered thereafter.”
'33': >-
  “And the tidings concerning Sītā should also be inquired of them with
  humility; there is a Vaikhānasa lake there, covered with golden lotuses.”
'34': >-
  “It is auspicious, ranged over by splendid swans shining like the rising sun;
  it is said to be the conveyance-bearer of Kubera, called Sārvabhauma.”
'35': >-
  “An elephant ever roams that region, accompanied by female elephants; and
  having crossed beyond that lake, there is a sky where moon and sun are unseen,
  where no constellations are gathered, without clouds, without frost, and
  without darkness.”
'36': >-
  “That land is illuminated, as though by the sun’s rays—by the self-luminous,
  godlike ascetics perfected in austerities, who are resting there.”
'37': >-
  “Having crossed that region, there is a river named Śailodā; on both its banks
  grow bamboos called Kīcakas.”
'38': >-
  “They bear the siddhas across to the far bank and bring them back again; there
  dwell the Northern Kurus, an abode for those who have acquired merit.”
'39': >-
  “Then there are thousands of rivers whose waters are made as though by golden
  lotuses—having leaves of blue vaidūrya (lapis-lazuli).”
'40': >-
  “Adorned with groves of red waterlilies, and with golden-hued blossoms, the
  pools and reservoirs there shine like the newly risen sun.”
'41': >-
  “That region is everywhere encompassed by variegated forests of blue lotuses,
  with leaves like precious gems and filaments of golden splendour.”
'42': >-
  “With incomparable pearls and with gems of great worth, the rivers there have
  banks heaped up and upheaved, and their sands are of gold.”
'43': >-
  “And they are plunged among excellent mountains, variegated and made wholly of
  all jewels, and also of gold, radiant like blazing fire.”
'44': >-
  “There the mountains bear flowers and fruits perpetually, crowded with
  leaf-borne birds; with divine fragrance, flavour, and touch, they pour forth
  every desired object.”
'45': >-
  “Other best of mountains yield garments of many kinds; and also ornaments
  variegated with pearls and vaidūrya—such as are fitting for women, and
  likewise such as are fitting for men.”
'46': >-
  “Other best of mountains produce enjoyments suited to every season; other best
  of mountains produce objects variegated with precious gems.”
'47': >-
  “Beds are brought forth there, with wondrous spreads and coverings; and other
  trees there bear garlands delightful to the mind.”
'48': >-
  “There are also drinks of highest value, and various kinds of food; and women
  endowed with virtues, marked by beauty and youth.”
'49': >-
  “Gandharvas, Kinnaras, siddhas, nāgas, and likewise Vidyādharas—radiant in
  splendour—ever sport there with women.”
'50': >-
  “All of them are doers of meritorious deeds; all are devoted to delight; all
  possess both desire and wealth; they dwell there together with their beloved
  women.”
'51': >-
  “There the din of songs and musical instruments, together with the sound of
  excellent laughter, is heard constantly—delighting the minds of all beings.”
'52': >-
  “There none is without joy, and none is fond of what is untrue or base; day
  after day the charming qualities there ever increase.”
'53': >-
  “Having crossed beyond that region, there is the northern ocean, the
  treasure-house of waters; and there, in its midst, stands a great mountain of
  gold named Somagiri.”
'54': >-
  “And those gods who have gone to Indra’s world, and those who have gone to
  Brahmā’s world—having attained heaven—behold that king of mountains.”
'55': >-
  “That region, though without the sun, shines by its own radiance; it is to be
  known by its sunlike splendour, as though it were scorched by the sun
  himself.”
'56': >-
  “There dwells the Blessed Lord, the Universal Self—Śambhu of elevenfold form;
  and Brahmā, the lord of gods, dwells there, surrounded by brahmarṣis.”
'57': >-
  “In no wise should you go beyond the northern boundary of the Kurus; for the
  course of other beings too does not proceed beyond that.”
'58': >-
  “For that Somagiri by name is difficult of access even to the gods; having
  seen it, you should then quickly return.”
'59': >-
  “Only thus far is it possible for vānaras to go, O best of vānaras; beyond
  that we know not—an un-sunned region, beyond all bounds.”
'60': >-
  “All this must be searched, as I have declared; and even where something else
  has not been spoken, there too your judgment must be applied.”
'61': >-
  “Then, by the deed of seeing the princess of Videha—swift and irresistible
  like the wind and fire—there will be wrought a great joy for the son of
  Daśaratha, and thereafter a great joy for me as well.”
'62': >-
  “Then, having accomplished your purpose, together with your kinsmen, honoured
  by me with all delightful excellences, you shall traverse the earth—your
  enemies quelled—O vānaras who bear the burden of beings, together with your
  beloveds.”
'63': >-
  Thus ends the forty-third chapter, called “The Dispatch to the Northern
  Quarter,” in the Kishkindhā Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
