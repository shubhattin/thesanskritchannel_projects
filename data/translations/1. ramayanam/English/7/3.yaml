'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Uttara-Kanda, begins the third
  canto named “The Attainment by Vaishravana of the post of Lokapala and of
  Lanka and the like.”
'1': >-
  Then Pulastya’s son, Vishrava—foremost among sages—within a short time, like
  his father, took his stand in austerity.
'2': >-
  Truthful, of good conduct, tranquil; devoted to Vedic study, pure; unattached
  amid all enjoyments, ever intent upon righteousness—such was he.
'3': >-
  Knowing his conduct and manner of life, Bharadwaja, the great sage, gave to
  Vishrava as wife his own daughter, a maiden of godlike complexion.
'4': >-
  Having duly accepted Bharadwaja’s daughter according to dharma,
  Vishrava—reflecting with a mind attentive to the welfare of offspring and
  pondering what would be best for him—
'5': >-
  the sage, filled with supreme joy, begot upon her a son endowed with mighty
  energy, most marvelous indeed.
'6': >-
  That knower of dharma brought forth a child possessed of all Brahma-like
  qualities; and when he was born, the Grandfather (Brahma) was greatly
  delighted.
'7': >-
  Foreseeing his intelligence to be beneficial and that he would become the lord
  over wealth, Brahma, pleased, bestowed a name upon him in the presence of the
  divine sages.
'8': >-
  “Since he is the offspring of Vishrava and resembles Vishrava himself,
  therefore he shall become renowned by the name Vaishravana.”
'9': >-
  That Vaishravana, then dwelling in a grove of austerities, grew in
  splendor—his oblations poured into the sacred fire—like fire itself, of great
  radiance.
'10': >-
  As he stayed in his hermitage, this resolve arose in that great-souled one: “I
  shall practice the highest dharma; for dharma indeed is the supreme goal.”
'11': >-
  He performed austerities for thousands of years in that great forest;
  restrained by fierce vows and strict observances, he undertook exceedingly
  great tapas.
'12': >-
  At the completion of each thousand years he adopted yet another discipline:
  subsisting on water; living on air alone; and likewise remaining altogether
  without food.
'13': >-
  Thus those thousands of years passed as though they were but a single year.
  Then the mighty one became the object of pleasure (to the gods), and Indra
  along with the hosts of celestials—
'14': >-
  Brahma went to his hermitage and spoke these words: “I am fully satisfied with
  you, dear child, O you of excellent vows, by this deed of yours. Choose a
  boon—good befall you! You are worthy of a boon, O great-minded one.”
'15': >-
  Then Vaishravana spoke to the Grandfather who had come into his presence:
  “Blessed Lord, I desire the guardianship of the world—the protection of
  riches.”
'16': >-
  Then Brahma, with a heart well pleased, said to Vaishravana, along with the
  hosts of gods, joyfully: “So be it!”
'17': “I indeed am resolved to create a fourth among the guardians of the worlds.”
'18': >-
  “The station of Yama, Indra, and Varuna—the rank which you desire—attain that.
  Go, for you are a knower of dharma; obtain lordship over treasures. Among
  Shakra (Indra), Ambupati (Varuna, lord of waters), and Yama, you shall be the
  fourth.”
'19': >-
  “And accept this aerial car named Pushpaka, radiant like the sun, for your
  conveyance; go forth to equality with the Thirty-three gods.”
'20': >-
  “Welfare be to you. We shall all depart, each as we came. We have fulfilled
  our purpose, dear one, by granting you your two boons.”
'21': Having spoken thus, Brahma went to his own abode, accompanied by the gods.
'22': >-
  After Brahma and the other gods had departed through the vault of the sky, he
  said to his father in the forest, with joined palms and a disciplined mind:
  “The God, that Lord of creatures, has not appointed a dwelling for me.”
'23': >-
  “Blessed sir, I have obtained from the Grandfather the boon I desired.
  Therefore, revered one—please show me some suitable place of residence, O
  master.”
'24': >-
  “A place where there may be no suffering for any living being whatsoever.”
  Thus addressed by his son, Vishrava, foremost among sages—
'25': >-
  that knower of dharma, best of the virtuous, spoke these words: “Listen.” On
  the shore of the southern ocean there is a mountain named Trikuta.
'26': >-
  Before it lies a vast city, like Mahendra’s (Indra’s) city. There is a
  delightful city named Lanka, built by Vishvakarman.
'27': >-
  As Amaravati is for Indra, so is it intended as a dwelling for the Rakshasas.
  Live there—good befall you—in Lanka; of this there is no doubt.
'28': >-
  That city is girded with golden ramparts and moats, and is furnished with
  engines and weapons. It is charming indeed, with arches (toranas) of gold and
  vaidurya (lapis/lazurite-like gems).
'29': >-
  Formerly, struck with fear of Vishnu, the Rakshasas abandoned it. Empty of all
  the Rakshasa hosts, they had gone down to the surface of Rasatala (the nether
  regions).
'30': >-
  Lanka is now empty; no lord of it exists. Therefore, my son, go there to dwell
  as you please, in comfort.
'31': >-
  Your residence there will be faultless; there will be no affliction to anyone
  there.” Hearing this dharmic, most righteous word of his father, that
  righteous-souled one—
'32': >-
  then established his abode in Lanka upon the mountain’s summit, along with
  thousands of Nairritas, joyful and greatly delighted.
'33': Within a short time, by his command, it became fully populated.
'34': >-
  There he dwelt content, that righteous-souled bull among the
  Nairritas—Vishrava’s son—in Lanka, encircled by the ocean as by a moat.
'35': >-
  And at due seasons the righteous lord of wealth, self-controlled, would come
  in the Pushpaka car to visit his father and his mother as well.
'36': >-
  Praised by companies of gods and Gandharvas, and with his dwelling adorned by
  the dances of Apsaras, making it resplendent with rays like the sun, that lord
  of riches went to the presence of his father.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the third canto, named “The Attainment by Vaishravana of the post of
  Lokapala and of Lanka and the like,” in the Uttara-Kanda of the holy
  Valmiki-Ramayana, the primeval epic, composed in the seers’ tradition.
