  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-first canto, named “Guha and Lakṣmaṇa’s Vigil.”
'1': >-
  Seeing Lakṣmaṇa awake, keeping watch without any deceit for his brother’s
  sake, Guha—his heart consumed with sorrow—spoke these words to Rāghava.
'2': >-
  “This, dear prince, is a comfortable couch arranged for your sake. Rest well
  upon it, O son of the king, as befits your ease.”
'3': >-
  “All these people are accustomed to hardship; you alone are accustomed to
  comfort. For the protection of Kakutstha, we shall keep vigil through the
  night.”
'4': >-
  “For me, there is no one on this earth dearer than Rāma. I tell you this as
  truth; and by truth itself I swear it to you.”
'5': >-
  “By his favour I hope, in this world, for very great renown—attainment of
  dharma in abundance, and also the gaining of wealth in full measure.”
'6': >-
  “Therefore I, with bow in hand, along with all my kinsmen on every side, shall
  guard my beloved friend Rāma as he lies down with Sītā.”
'7': >-
  “Indeed, nothing is unknown to me in this forest in which we always move
  about. Even a very great fourfold army we are able to withstand.”
'8': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa said to him, “Protected by you, O sinless one, none of us is
  afraid here, as we keep our eyes fixed upon dharma alone.”
'9': >-
  “How could sleep be obtained by me—or life itself, or any happiness—when the
  son of Daśaratha lies upon the ground together with Sītā?”
'10': >-
  “He whom all the devas and asuras together cannot overpower in battle—see him
  now, lying in comfort upon grass, together with Sītā.”
'11': >-
  “He who has been won through counsel and austerity, and through manifold
  exertions—this one, the single son of Daśaratha, is endowed with marks
  befitting him.”
'12': >-
  “When this king has gone forth into exile, he will not endure for long. The
  earth, surely, will soon become a widow.”
'13': >-
  “The women have ceased their loud lamentations and are stilled by exhaustion.
  Dear friend, I think the royal palace has fallen silent, its cries ended.”
'14': >-
  “Kauśalyā, the king, and my own mother as well—I do not expect that they all
  will remain alive through this night.”
'15': >-
  “My mother might still live, out of regard for Śatrughna; but that sorrow—that
  Kauśalyā, mother of a hero, will perish.”
'16': >-
  “That city, once crowded with devoted people, bringing delight by its pleasant
  sights and ease, is now mingled with royal calamity and will be ruined.”
'17': >-
  “How will the life-breaths of the great king endure, when he no longer beholds
  his eldest son, the great-souled one, so dear to him?”
'18': >-
  “After the king has perished, Kauśalyā will perish; and afterwards my own
  mother too will meet with destruction.”
'19': >-
  “‘Gone, gone,’—having failed to obtain his heart’s desire, and without placing
  Rāma upon the throne, my father will perish.”
'20': >-
  “When that time arrives, those who have accomplished their ends will perform
  for the king, in full, all the rites and preparations of the departed.”
'21': >-
  “That capital—charming with its squares and crossings, with broad highways
  well laid out, rich in mansions and lofty palaces, adorned by the choicest
  courtesans—
'22': >-
  “crowded with chariots, horses, and elephants, resounding with the sound of
  instruments, complete in every auspiciousness, filled with rejoicing,
  flourishing people—”
'23': >-
  “abounding in pleasure-groves and gardens, rich in gatherings and festivals—my
  father’s citizens will move about in that royal city in happiness.”
'24': >-
  “If only Daśaratha might live, and we too, returning from forest-dwelling,
  might again behold that great-souled one of noble vows.”
'25': >-
  “If only we, safe and well, together with him whose vow is truth, might, when
  this forest-dwelling is ended, enter Ayodhyā.”
'26': >-
  As that great-souled prince, afflicted with sorrow, lamented and stood thus,
  that night passed away.
'27': >-
  Then, as he spoke what was true and for the welfare of the people,
  Guha—through deep affection for the prince, the son of the lord of
  men—released tears, pressed down by calamity, fevered with anguish, like an
  elephant tormented by pain.
'28': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-first canto, named “Guha and Lakṣmaṇa’s Vigil,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic.
