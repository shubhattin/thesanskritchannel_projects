'0': >-
  Then, in the holy and illustrious Valmiki Ramayana, in the Kishkindha-kanda,
  begins the Eighth Canto, called “The Vow to Slay Vali.”
'1': >-
  Then Sugriva, delighted and gladdened by those words, spoke this speech to the
  heroic elder brother of Lakshmana.
'2': >-
  In every way I am indeed favoured by the gods—of this there is no doubt—since
  you, endowed with virtues and fitting in every respect, have become my friend.
'3': >-
  With you as my helper, O sinless one, it would indeed be possible even to
  obtain the sovereignty of the gods; what then of my own kingdom, O lord?
'4': >-
  O Raghava, I am truly to be honoured among my kinsmen and friends, for I have
  gained, with Fire as witness, a friend born in the lineage of the Raghavas.
'5': >-
  I too, in time, will be known by you to be a companion suited to you; yet I am
  not able to speak forth the virtues that dwell within you.
'6': >-
  For in great souls—especially those like you, self-possessed and
  noble—affection becomes steadfast; and the fortitude of the self-controlled, O
  best of men, does not waver.
'7': >-
  Whether it be silver or gold, or auspicious ornaments—among the righteous,
  these are regarded as undivided; the good understand (all things) as belonging
  in common.
'8': >-
  Whether one is wealthy or poor, distressed or happy, free from fault or
  possessed of fault—a companion is the highest refuge.
'9': >-
  For the sake of a friend, O sinless one, men renounce wealth, renounce
  pleasures, and even renounce their country, seeing such affection (between
  friends).
'10': >-
  Hearing this, Rama replied, “So be it,” to Sugriva, who spoke pleasing
  words—there in the presence of Lakshmana—Rama resplendent in fortune and wise,
  like Indra himself.
'11': >-
  Then, seeing Rama standing there, and Lakshmana of great strength as well,
  Sugriva cast his roaming glance in every direction through the forest.
'12': >-
  Then the lord of monkeys beheld a sala tree not far away—full of lovely
  blossoms, somewhat rich in foliage, and made beautiful by swarms of bees.
'13': >-
  Breaking off a single branch thick with leaves and fair to behold, Sugriva
  spread it out for Rama, and sat down along with Raghava.
'14': >-
  Seeing the two seated thus, Hanuman also, together with Lakshmana, tore off a
  branch of the sala tree and made a respectful seat (for himself).
'15': >-
  There, on that excellent mountain, strewn with fallen sala blossoms, Rama sat
  at ease—serene like the tranquil ocean.
'16': >-
  Then Sugriva, filled with delight, spoke to Rama with gentle and auspicious
  words, in affection—his syllables tremulous with joy.
'17': >-
  “I have been wronged by my brother; stricken with fear I wander here—on this
  great mountain Rishyamuka—bereft of my wife and plunged in grievous sorrow.
'18': >-
  Thus I, terrified and sunk in fear, with mind bewildered in the forest, have
  been deceived by Vali, my brother; and with him I am in enmity, O Raghava.
'19': >-
  O you who are terrible to all worlds (to evil-doers), I am afflicted by fear
  of Vali; do you also, I who am without refuge, deserve your grace.
'20': >-
  Thus addressed, that radiant scion of Kakutstha, knower of dharma and devoted
  to dharma, replied to Sugriva as though smiling.
'21': >-
  “A friend is the fruit of kindness; harm is the mark of an enemy. This very
  day I shall slay him who carried off your wife.”
'22': >-
  “Behold these shafts of mine, O fortunate one—winged, of blazing splendour,
  sprung from the reeds of Kartikeya’s forest, and adorned with gold.”
'23': >-
  “Covered with heron-feathers, resembling the thunderbolt of mighty Indra,
  well-jointed and keen-pointed—like enraged serpents.”
'24': >-
  “Behold your foe named Vali—your elder brother, guilty of wrongdoing—struck
  down by my arrows, shattered like a mountain broken asunder.”
'25': >-
  Hearing the words of Raghava, Sugriva, the lord of the monkey-host, attained
  incomparable joy and exclaimed, “Well spoken! Well spoken!”
'26': >-
  “Rama, I am overwhelmed by grief, and you are the refuge of the
  grief-stricken. Indeed, calling you ‘friend,’ I lament before you.”
'27': >-
  “For by the clasping of hands you have become my companion, with Fire as
  witness—dearer to me than life itself; and I swear this by truth.”
'28': >-
  “And calling you ‘friend,’ I speak to you with trust; yet that sorrow hidden
  within me steals away my heart continually.”
'29': >-
  Having spoken thus, his eyes tainted with tears, and his voice choked by
  tears, he was not able to speak aloud.
'30': >-
  But the rush of tears that suddenly came upon him like the surge of a river,
  Sugriva restrained with fortitude in Rama’s presence.
'31': >-
  Checking those tears, and wiping his fair eyes, and heaving a sigh, that
  radiant one spoke once more to Raghava:
'32': >-
  “Formerly, O Rama, I was driven out of my kingdom by Vali; and after hearing
  harsh words, I was cast away by the stronger one.”
'33': >-
  “And he carried off my wife, who is dearer to me than life; and those friends
  of mine were bound in fetters under restraint.”
'34': >-
  “And that evil-souled one, intent upon my destruction, O Raghava—many times I
  have slain monkeys who were set upon me as weapons (sent against me).”
'35': >-
  “And because of this suspicion, even upon seeing you, O Raghava, I do not
  approach—afraid; for in fear, all creatures indeed tremble.”
'36': >-
  “Only these companions of mine, headed by Hanuman, remain as my support;
  therefore I preserve my life today, though fallen into distress.”
'37': >-
  “For these affectionate monkeys protect me on every side; they go with me when
  I must go, and they ever remain when I stay.”
'38': >-
  “This is the brief account, O Rama—why speak to you at length? He who is my
  enemy and brother, the elder—Vali—of famed prowess (is the cause).”
'39': >-
  “With his destruction, my sorrow too would be wiped away at once; my happiness
  and even my very life depend upon his destruction.”
'40': >-
  “This, O Rama, is the end of my grief, declared by one afflicted with grief:
  whether in misery or in happiness, a friend is ever the refuge of a friend.”
'41': >-
  Hearing these words, Rama spoke thus to Sugriva: “For what reason did this
  enmity arise? I wish to hear the truth in its entirety.”
'42': >-
  “For, O monkey, after hearing the cause of your enmity, I shall, immediately
  thereafter, act—having duly considered strength and weakness.”
'43': >-
  “For my indignation is mighty; hearing that you have been dishonoured, my
  heart, trembling within, swells—like waters in the rush of the rainy season.”
'44': >-
  “Joyfully tell me, speaking without fear—until my bow is strung; for once my
  arrow is released, your foe shall be cast down.”
'45': >-
  Thus addressed by the great-souled Kakutstha, Sugriva gained incomparable
  delight, together with four monkeys (attending him).
'46': >-
  Then Sugriva, his face bright with joy, began to relate to Rama, the elder
  brother of Lakshmana, the true cause of that enmity.
'47': >-
  Thus ends the Eighth Canto, called “The Vow to Slay Vali,” in the
  Kishkindha-kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the Adi-kavya.
