  Now begins the fifty-third sarga in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Battle with Vajradaṃṣṭra.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that Dhūmrākṣa had been slain, Rāvaṇa, the lord of the rākṣasas, was
  seized by mighty wrath, and he breathed hard like a serpent.
'2': >-
  Drawing a long, hot breath, his mind sullied by anger, he spoke to the cruel
  rākṣasa Vajradaṃṣṭra of great strength:
'3': >-
  “Go forth, O hero—march out surrounded by rākṣasas. Slay Rāma, son of
  Daśaratha, and Sugrīva together with the vānaras.”
'4': >-
  Saying “So be it,” that wielder of illusion, the rākṣasa commander, swiftly
  went forth with his forces, accompanied by many attendants.
'5': >-
  Well-equipped and well-prepared, he was attended with elephants, horses,
  asses, and camels, and he was adorned with many banners and variegated
  standards.
'6': >-
  Adorned with wondrous armlets and a crown, he donned his armor; and with bow
  in hand he went out quickly.
'7': >-
  After circumambulating his radiant chariot—decked with flags and embellished
  with ornaments of heated gold—the army-lord mounted it.
'8': >-
  With spears and bright javelins, with smooth clubs as well, with bhindipālas,
  bows, and śaktis, and also with axes (paṭṭiśas),
'9': >-
  with swords, discs, and maces, and with keen battle-axes—foot-soldiers of many
  kinds marched forth, bearing weapons in their hands.
'10': >-
  All those foremost of rākṣasas, clad in diverse garments, shone forth; and the
  mighty elephants—terrible and heroic—moved like mountains in motion.
'11': >-
  Skilled in warfare, some were mounted, holding javelins and goads in their
  hands; others, furnished with the proper marks and equipment, were heroic
  riders of great strength.
'12': >-
  That entire rākṣasa host, as it marched out, appeared splendid—like clouds in
  the rainy season, roaring and flashing with lightning.
'13': >-
  As they issued forth from the southern gate, the very place where the
  troop-leader Aṅgada had taken position, ominous portents arose for them as
  they came out.
'14': >-
  From the sky, thick with clouds, fierce meteors fell then, vomiting tongues of
  fire; and dreadful jackals howled.
'15': >-
  Terrible beasts cried out then, proclaiming the destruction of the rākṣasas;
  and as the warriors rushed onward, they stumbled there in a fearful manner.
'16': >-
  Seeing these portents, Vajradaṃṣṭra of great might—radiant and
  resolute—steadied himself with courage and went forth, eager for battle.
'17': >-
  But when the victorious vānaras saw them advancing, they raised exceedingly
  great roars, filling the directions with their sound.
'18': >-
  Then commenced a tumultuous, dreadful clash of vānaras with rākṣasas—of
  frightful, terrible forms—each longing to slay the other.
'19': >-
  Leaping into the fray with great ardor, bearing bodies and heads split
  asunder, their limbs drenched in blood, they fell upon the surface of the
  earth.
'20': >-
  Some heroes, having closed with one another—mighty-armed like iron bars—hurled
  diverse weapons, never turning back in battle.
'21': >-
  There was heard there a very great din—the crashing of trees and rocks and
  weapons—grim and heart-rending.
'22': >-
  There arose a tumultuous sound of chariot-wheels and, terribly, of bows as
  well; and the blare of conches, kettledrums, and mṛdaṅgas became uproarious.
'23': Some, casting aside their weapons, fought hand-to-hand.
'24': >-
  With open palms and with feet as well, with fists and even with trees, some
  rākṣasas were struck—their bodies broken; and some were crushed to powder by
  boulders, by vānaras maddened with the fury of battle.
'25': >-
  Vajradaṃṣṭra, greatly terrifying the vānaras in battle with his arrows, ranged
  about like Death at the world’s destruction, as though holding a noose in his
  hand.
'26': >-
  Powerful rākṣasas, skilled in missiles and bearing weapons of many kinds,
  maddened with wrath, slew the armies of the vānaras in battle.
'27': >-
  Then Vāli’s son—bold in battle—slew all those rākṣasas, seized by anger
  doubled in intensity, like the fire of universal dissolution.
'28': >-
  Lifting a tree as his weapon, mighty Aṅgada—his eyes reddened with wrath—fell
  upon all those companies of rākṣasas like a lion upon petty beasts.
'29': >-
  Equal to Indra in prowess, he wrought a dreadful carnage. There the rākṣasas
  of terrible valor were struck down by Aṅgada.
'30': >-
  With heads split asunder they fell, like trees that have been hewn down—amid
  chariots with bright banners, horses, and the bodies of vānaras and rākṣasas.
'31': >-
  Then the earth, covered by torrents of blood, became terrifying; yet it was,
  as it were, adorned with necklaces, armlets, garments, and weapons strewn
  about.
'32': >-
  On that battlefield the earth shone like an autumn night; and by the onrush of
  Aṅgada, that great rākṣasa host trembled there—like a cloud shaken by the
  wind.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-third sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the holy, illustrious
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the Ādikāvya, called “The Battle with
  Vajradaṃṣṭra.”
