  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, is the thirty-fifth
  sarga, called “A Brief Account of Umā and Gaṅgā.”
'1': >-
  Then, when the remainder of the night had been spent on the bank of the Śoṇa
  by the great seers, at the coming of a fair dawn in that night, Viśvāmitra
  addressed them.
'2': >-
  “The night has dawned well, O Rāma; the former twilight is setting in. Arise,
  arise—may auspiciousness be yours; consent in your mind to depart.”
'3': >-
  Hearing his words, Rāma—having performed the morning rites as
  prescribed—approved of the journey and spoke these words as well:
'4': >-
  “This Śoṇa has auspicious waters, is deep, and is adorned with sandbanks. By
  which path, O Brahman, shall we cross over?”
'5': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, Viśvāmitra said this: “This is the path I have
  indicated—the way by which the great seers pass.”
'6': >-
  So spoken to by the wise Viśvāmitra, those great seers set forth, and as they
  went they beheld forests of many kinds.
'7': >-
  After they had gone a long distance, when half the day had passed, they saw
  Jāhnavī—the best among rivers—resorted to by sages.
'8': >-
  Seeing that river whose waters are holy, attended by swans and sārasas, all
  the sages together with the Rāghavas became delighted.
'9': >-
  On its bank, then, all of them made their encampment. Thereafter, bathing
  according to rule, they duly satisfied the Pitṛs and the deities.
'10': >-
  And having offered the agnihotra oblations, and having partaken of the
  sacrificial remnant, like nectar, they entered upon the auspicious bank of the
  Jāhnavī with joyful minds.
'11': >-
  Surrounding the great-souled Viśvāmitra on every side, they stood as was
  proper; and the two Rāghavas also, as befitted them. Then Rāma, exceedingly
  glad at heart, spoke to Viśvāmitra:
'12': >-
  “O Bhagavān, I desire to hear about Gaṅgā, that river who goes by three
  paths—how, spanning the three worlds, she came to the lord of rivers and
  streams.”
'13': >-
  Urged on by Rāma’s words, Viśvāmitra, the great sage, began indeed to tell of
  Gaṅgā’s origin and her increase.
'14': >-
  “The lord of mountains, Himavān, O Rāma, is a mighty mine of minerals. He had
  two daughters, O Rāma, unparalleled in beauty upon the earth.
'15': >-
  Their mother, O Rāma, the daughter of Meru, was slender-waisted and
  pleasing—Menā by name—dear wife of Himavān.
'16': >-
  From her was born this Gaṅgā, the eldest daughter of Himavān; and Umā was the
  second daughter—of that same one, O Rāghava.
'17': >-
  Then all the gods, desiring to accomplish divine work, sought the lord of
  mountains for his eldest—Gaṅgā, the river who courses along three paths.
'18': >-
  Himavān, in accordance with dharma, gave his daughter—the purifier of the
  worlds—Gaṅgā, who goes by her own free course, out of a wish for the welfare
  of the three worlds.
'19': >-
  Receiving her for the sake of the three worlds, intent upon the good of the
  three worlds, they went forth taking Gaṅgā with them, their inner selves
  satisfied, their purpose fulfilled.
'20': >-
  But the other mountain-born maiden who existed, O delighter of the Raghus—she,
  rich in austerity—undertook a severe and excellent vow and practiced tapas.
'21': >-
  And the best of mountains gave that daughter—endowed with terrible
  austerity—Umā, worshipped by the worlds, to Rudra of matchless form.
'22': >-
  These, O Rāghava, are the two daughters of the king of mountains, venerated by
  the worlds: Gaṅgā, the best among rivers, and the goddess Umā.
'23': >-
  All this has been related to you—how the one who goes by three paths first
  went to the sky, O dear one, O best among the swift-moving.
'24': >-
  Thus, that lovely divine river, the daughter of the lord of mountains,
  ascended then to the world of the gods—she, the water-bearer free from sin.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fifth sarga of the Bāla-kāṇḍa in the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “A Brief Account of Umā and Gaṅgā.”
