  Now begins the fifty-third sarga of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Rebuke of Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Beholding him as he soared up through the sky, Maithilī—Janaka’s daughter—was
  overwhelmed with sorrow, exceedingly distressed, abiding in a great fear.
'2': >-
  With eyes reddened by anger and tears, Sītā—weeping piteously—addressed that
  lord of the rākṣasas, the dreadful-eyed one, as she was being carried away.
'3': >-
  “Art thou not ashamed, O vile Rāvaṇa, of this deed?—thou who, knowing me to be
  bereft (of my protector), stealest me away and fleest like a thief.
'4': >-
  Surely, O wicked-souled one, wishing to carry me off in cowardice, thou alone
  didst, by thy delusive art, lure away my lord in the guise of a deer.
'5': >-
  And he who rose up to rescue me—he too has been struck down: that ancient king
  of vultures, friend of my father-in-law.
'6': >-
  Great indeed is the prowess that is seen in thee, O basest of rākṣasas: having
  only made thy name heard, thou hast not conquered me in battle.
'7': >-
  How, having done such a censurable act, art thou not ashamed—O base one—of
  carrying off a woman, and that too one who belongs to another and is without
  her protector?
'8': >-
  Men in the worlds will speak of thy reprehensible deed—most cruel and
  unrighteous—though thou deemest thyself a hero of mighty valor.
'9': >-
  Shame upon thy vaunted heroism and thy strength of spirit, which thou didst
  proclaim before; shame upon conduct like this, which brings reproach upon
  one’s lineage in the world.
'10': >-
  What can be done in such a manner as this—that thou runnest with speed alone?
  Stand but for even a moment; thou shalt not depart alive.
'11': >-
  For, once thou comest within the range of sight of those two sons of the king,
  thou—though supported by an army—art not able to live even for a moment.
'12': >-
  In no wise art thou capable of enduring the touch of their arrows—like a bird
  unable to bear the touch of fire blazing in a forest.
'13': >-
  Do what is truly wholesome for thyself; release me, O Rāvaṇa. My husband,
  enraged at the outrage done to me, will act together with his brother.
'14': >-
  If thou dost not release me, he will bring about thy destruction—he whose
  resolve makes thee, by force, desire to carry me away.
'15': >-
  But thy resolve, O base one, will prove fruitless; for I—while not beholding
  that lord of mine, like unto the gods—
'16': >-
  —cannot endure to keep my life long, being fallen into the enemy’s power.
  Surely thou dost not consider thine own welfare, nor what is salutary.
'17': >-
  As a mortal, at the time of death, resorts to what is contrary, so to all who
  are about to perish that which is wholesome finds no favor.
'18': >-
  I see thee here as one bound about the neck by the noose of Time; and yet, in
  this place of terror, O night-roamer, thou art not afraid.
'19': >-
  Surely thou clearly beholdest golden trees, and the dreadful Vaitaraṇī river,
  bearing along torrents of blood.
'20': >-
  Thou seest also, O Rāvaṇa, a fearful forest whose leaves are swords, with
  blossoms of heated gold and canopies of excellent vaidūrya gems.
'21': >-
  Thou shalt behold the sharp śālmali tree, bristling with iron thorns; for,
  having done such a deed, thou shalt not long uphold this falsehood against
  that great-souled one.
'22': >-
  O pitiless one—like one who has drunk poison—thou shalt not be able to endure
  for long, for thou art bound by the noose of Time, hard to avert, O Rāvaṇa.
'23': >-
  Whither gone wilt thou find refuge from my husband, the great-souled one—he
  who in the space of but a moment is never without his brother in battle?
'24': >-
  He by whom fourteen thousand rākṣasas were slain—how can that hero Rāghava,
  skilled in all weapons and mighty,
'25': >-
  —fail to slay thee with keen arrows, thou abductor of another’s cherished
  wife?” Thus did Vaidehī, seated upon Rāvaṇa’s lap, overwhelmed by fear and
  grief, lament piteously—these and other harsh words.
'26': >-
  Then that sinful one carried away the young princess, sorely afflicted,
  speaking much, lamenting first and crying piteously—trembling in all her limbs
  as she struggled.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-third sarga of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the great Ādikāvya, called “The Rebuke of Rāvaṇa.”
