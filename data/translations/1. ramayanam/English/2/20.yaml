  Now begins, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, the twentieth
  chapter, entitled “Kausalyā’s Lamentation.”
'1': >-
  But when that tiger among men (Rāma) was departing with joined palms in
  reverence, then, in the women’s apartments of the inner palace, a great cry of
  anguish arose.
'2': >-
  Urged on by his father in all duties, and being the refuge and sole resort of
  the entire inner palace, that very Rāma is today being sent away into exile.
'3': >-
  Even as he ever behaves with due propriety toward Kausalyā, his mother, so too
  has that scion of Raghu behaved toward all of us from the very time of his
  birth.
'4': >-
  Even when abused or cursed, he does not grow wrathful, ever avoiding what is
  fit to provoke anger; and he pacifies all who are enraged—he, such as he is,
  is today being banished from here.
'5': >-
  Alas, our king must surely have lost his understanding, though he still walks
  among the living—he who casts away Rāghava, the refuge and sure course of all
  beings.
'6': >-
  Thus spoke all the chief queens, like cows bereft of their calves; and they
  wailed for their lord, crying aloud with clamorous lamentation.
'7': >-
  That lord of the earth, already scorched by grief for his son, hearing in the
  inner palace that terrible outcry of distress, sank down upon his seat in
  dejection.
'8': >-
  But Rāma, exceedingly afflicted, sighing like an elephant,
  went—self-controlled—together with his brother, to his mother’s inner
  apartments.
'9': >-
  There he saw an aged man, held in highest reverence, seated at the doorway of
  the house, and many others standing nearby.
'10': >-
  As soon as they beheld Rāma, all of them came forward; and, with cries of
  “Victory!”, they hailed Rāghava, the best of the victorious.
'11': >-
  Entering the first chamber, he beheld in the second venerable brāhmaṇas,
  endowed with the Vedas, aged, and honored by the king.
'12': >-
  Having bowed to those elders, Rāma then beheld in the third chamber women,
  children, and the aged, intent upon guarding the doorway.
'13': >-
  Those women, delighted, offered him respectful benedictions; and, entering the
  house, they swiftly announced to Rāma’s mother the welcome arrival of her
  beloved.
'14': >-
  Kausalyā too, that goddess-queen, having passed the night composed in mind,
  performed at dawn worship of Viṣṇu, seeking her son’s welfare.
'15': >-
  Clad in linen garments, joyful, ever devoted to her vows, she then offered
  oblations into the sacred fire with mantras, having duly performed the
  auspicious rites.
'16': >-
  Entering then his mother’s auspicious inner apartments, Rāma saw his mother
  there kindling and tending the sacrificial fire.
'17': >-
  And he saw there items set out for divine worship—curds, unhusked rice,
  clarified butter, sweetmeats, and offerings of oblation as well.
'18': >-
  The delight of the Raghu line beheld parched grain, white garlands, milk-rice,
  and kṛsara (a cooked mixture), as well as faggots for the fire and full
  water-pots.
'19': >-
  He saw that fair-complexioned lady, wrapped in white linen, worn thin by the
  discipline of her vows, satisfying the deity with water-oblations.
'20': >-
  After a long time, seeing her son—gladdener of his mother—arrived, she
  approached him in great joy, like a mare hastening to her young colt.
'21': >-
  Rāghava received his mother as she came; and, embracing her with both arms, he
  kissed her upon the head.
'22': >-
  Then Kausalyā, out of motherly affection, spoke these dear and wholesome words
  to her unconquerable son, Rāghava.
'23': >-
  “May you attain long life, renown, and righteousness befitting your lineage,
  by honoring the aged, the virtuous, and the great royal sages.”
'24': >-
  “Behold your father, the king, true to his vows, O Rāghava. This very day that
  righteous-souled lord will anoint you to the office of Prince Regent.”
'25': >-
  Having taken the seat that was given, and being invited to partake of food,
  Rāghava, stretching forth his joined palms a little, spoke to his mother.
'26': >-
  Modest by nature, and bowing out of reverence, he began to inform her and to
  ask leave, as one about to depart for the Daṇḍaka forest.
'27': >-
  “O देवी (noble lady), surely you do not yet know that a great danger has
  arisen—one that will bring sorrow to you, to Vaidehī (Sītā), and to Lakṣmaṇa.”
'28': >-
  “I shall go to the Daṇḍaka forest—what is this seat to me? The time has now
  come upon me when I am fit rather for the forest-floor and a spread of grass
  than for a lofty throne.”
'29': >-
  “For fourteen years I shall dwell in the solitary wilderness, living on roots
  and fruits, renouncing meat, like an ascetic.”
'30': >-
  “The great king grants the princedom to Bharata; and me, as one devoted to
  austerity, he banishes to the Daṇḍaka forest.”
'31': >-
  “Thus shall I live in the lonely woods for six and eight years (that is,
  fourteen), resorting to forest fare and sustaining myself on fruits and
  roots.”
'32': >-
  At those words, the queen fell suddenly—like a staff of a śāla tree hewn down
  by an axe in the forest—like a goddess fallen from heaven.
'33': >-
  Seeing his mother, unaccustomed to suffering, fallen like a plantain tree,
  Rāma raised her up, she being bereft of consciousness.
'34': >-
  Turning back to her as she rose—wretched, like a mare wearied by the burden
  she has drawn—her whole body covered with dust, he gently stroked her with his
  hand.
'35': >-
  Then Kausalyā—accustomed to happiness, now tormented by misery—addressed that
  tiger among men, Rāma, while Lakṣmaṇa listened.
'36': >-
  “If you, my son, O Rāghava, had not been born, then I—childless—should not
  have had to behold sorrow greater than this, for my grief.”
'37': >-
  “For a barren woman there is only one grief in the mind—anguish at being
  without offspring; there is no other ‘son’ besides that.”
'38': >-
  “I never before knew welfare or happiness through the might of a husband; yet
  I held on to this—‘perhaps through my son I shall see it’—and that hope was
  fixed upon you, O Rāma.”
'39': >-
  “But now I shall have to hear many words, displeasing and heart-rending, from
  my co-wives, though I am the chief among them and a virtuous lady.”
'40': >-
  “What could be more painful for a woman than this—such grief and lamentation
  as mine, boundless and without end?”
'41': >-
  “Though you were near, even so I lived cast aside. Then how much more, dear
  child, when you have gone—surely it will be nothing but death for me.”
'42': >-
  “I am utterly kept down, ever disfavored by my husband; and in Kaikeyī’s
  household I am treated as equal—or even as inferior.”
'43': >-
  “Whoever serves me, or even follows my wishes, that person, watching for
  Kaikeyī’s son, is not spoken to (is ignored and slighted).”
'44': >-
  “How, in my wretched state, shall I be able to look upon Kaikeyī’s face,
  harsh-tongued through habitual anger, O my son?”
'45': >-
  “Ten and seven years of your life, O Rāghava, have passed while I, longing for
  the end of my sorrow, waited.”
'46': >-
  “Yet this vast sorrow, unending, I have no strength to bear any longer—this
  humiliation at the hands of co-wives, O Rāghava, even though I have grown
  old.”
'47': >-
  “Without beholding your face—bright like the full moon—how shall I, wretched
  and living a wretched life, continue to live?”
'48': >-
  “By fasts, disciplines, and many hardships, you were reared in suffering by
  me, through my misfortune—and all that has proved vain.”
'49': >-
  “Surely my heart must be of iron, since it does not split asunder—like the
  bank of a great river in the rainy season when struck by fresh flood-waters.”
'50': >-
  “Surely there is no death appointed for me, nor any place for me in Yama’s
  abode—since Death does not today take me away, though I am weeping, as a lion
  seizes by force a crying doe.”
'51': >-
  “Surely my heart is iron— it does not break, it does not burst upon the earth;
  though this body is given over to such sorrow, it is certain that untimely
  death is not for me.”
'52': >-
  “This indeed is my grief—that my vows, my gifts, and my restraints have become
  fruitless; and the austerity I practiced from longing for a child has been
  utterly barren, like seed sown in a saline waste.”
'53': >-
  “If one crushed by heavy grief could, by mere chance, obtain death before
  one’s time, then I would today have gone to the assembly of the
  departed—without you, my calf-like son—like a cow without her young.”
'54': >-
  “And yet, what use is my life today—empty—without you, O you whose face and
  radiance are like the moon? I shall follow you into the forest, even as a very
  feeble cow follows her calf, yearning for it.”
'55': >-
  Thus, exceedingly miserable and unable to endure it, she wailed at length,
  gazing upon Rāghava; seeing that great calamity, she looked upon her son as
  though he were bound—like a kinnara-woman beholding her child.
'56': >-
  Thus ends the twentieth chapter of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “Kausalyā’s Lamentation.”
