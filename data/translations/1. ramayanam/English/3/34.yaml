  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the thirty-fourth
  canto, called “Counsel concerning the Abduction of Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa, seeing Śūrpaṇakhā uttering harsh words, and being enraged in the
  midst of his ministers, questioned her closely.
'2': >-
  “Who is this Rāma? What is his prowess? What is his form, and what is his
  might and valor? For what reason has he entered the Daṇḍaka forest, so
  difficult to traverse?”
'3': >-
  “And what weapon does Rāma bear by which those rākṣasas were slain by you? And
  in battle Khara was killed, and likewise Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras.”
'4': >-
  “Tell me the truth, O lovely-limbed one—by whom were you disfigured?” Thus
  addressed by the lord of rākṣasas, the rākṣasī, overwhelmed by wrath, (began
  to speak).
'5': >-
  Then she began to relate Rāma in due manner: “Long-armed, large-eyed, clad in
  bark-garments and a black antelope-skin,”
'6': >-
  “like Kandarpa (the god of love) in beauty is Rāma, the son of Daśaratha;
  drawing his bow, resembling Indra’s bow, and wearing golden armlets,”
'7': >-
  “he hurls forth blazing nārācas (steel-shafted arrows), like great venomous
  serpents; he is mighty, releasing dreadful arrows that roar as they fly,”
'8': >-
  “I do not see Rāma in combat drawing his bow in vain; rather I see that army
  being slaughtered by showers of arrows.”
'9': >-
  “As a splendid crop is smitten by Indra with a rain of hailstones, so were
  (felled) fourteen thousand rākṣasas of terrible strength,”
'10': >-
  “all slain by sharp arrows by that one man fighting on foot; and within
  somewhat more than half a muhūrta, Khara too was slain, together with Dūṣaṇa.”
'11': >-
  “Fearlessness was granted to the sages, and the Daṇḍaka region was made
  secure.”
'12': >-
  “Somehow I alone was released, after being humiliated by that great-souled
  Rāma, who, knowing his own righteous nature, suspected the sin of killing a
  woman.”
'13': >-
  “And his brother also is of great splendor, equal to him in valor and in
  virtues—devoted and loyal—the mighty one named Lakṣmaṇa,”
'14': >-
  “intolerant (of insult), unconquerable, a victor, daring, intelligent, and
  strong—Rāma’s right arm, ever his very life moving outside him,”
'15': >-
  “But Rāma’s wife is large-eyed, with a face like the full moon—his lawful
  consort, ever dear to him, constantly intent upon what is pleasing and
  beneficial to her lord.”
'16': >-
  “She is fair-haired, with a lovely nose and thighs, beautiful in form and
  renowned; like a goddess she shines in this forest, like another Śrī (Lakṣmī)
  herself.”
'17': >-
  “Of the hue of heated gold, auspicious, with red, lofty nails—Sītā by name, of
  excellent hips, Vaidehī, slender-waisted,”
'18': >-
  “neither a goddess, nor a gandharvī, nor a yakṣī, nor a kiṃnarī—such a woman
  have I never before seen upon the earth.”
'19': >-
  “He whose wife Sītā would be, and whom she would gladly embrace—he would
  surpass, in all the worlds, even Purandara (Indra).”
'20': >-
  “She is virtuous in conduct, her form worthy of praise, incomparable in beauty
  upon earth; she is a wife suited to you, and you are an excellent husband for
  her.”
'21': >-
  “Her—broad-hipped, with full and lofty breasts, with a beautiful face—I was
  ready to bring to you for the sake of (making her) your wife.”
'22': >-
  “But I have been disfigured by cruel Lakṣmaṇa, O mighty-armed one; and having
  seen today that Vaidehī with her face like the full moon,”
'23': >-
  “you will come under the sway of Kāma’s arrows. If the desire arises in you to
  have her as your wife, quickly let your right foot be lifted here for
  victory.”
'24': >-
  “If this speech of mine pleases you, O lord of rākṣasas, then, O Rāvaṇa, let
  my word be carried out without hesitation.”
'25': >-
  “Knowing the helplessness of these (two) and acting accordingly, O very mighty
  one—let blameless-limbed Sītā become your wife, O lord of rākṣasas.”
'26': >-
  “Having heard that the night-rangers dwelling at Jana-sthāna were slain by
  Rāma with straight-flying arrows, and seeing Khara slain and Dūṣaṇa struck
  down, you ought today to undertake what must be done.”
'27': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fourth canto, called “Counsel concerning the Abduction of
  Sītā,” in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
