  Now begins the fifty-eighth sarga of the Bāla-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Curse of Triśaṅku.”
'1': >-
  Then, hearing Triśaṅku’s words, and filled with wrath, a hundred sons of the
  Ṛṣi (Vasiṣṭha) said this to the king, O Rāma.
'2': >-
  “You have been rejected, O evil-minded one, by your guru who is a speaker of
  truth. How then, transgressing him, have you sought refuge in another branch
  (another priestly line)?”
'3': >-
  “For to all the Ikṣvāku kings, the family-priest is the highest resort; and
  the word of one who speaks truth cannot be overstepped.”
'4': >-
  “The venerable Ṛṣi Vasiṣṭha has said that it is impossible. How could we, by
  any means whatsoever, be capable of conducting that sacrifice for you?”
'5': >-
  “O best of men, you are childish; return again to your own city. O king—though
  the Blessed One has power to officiate even for the three worlds—(still) this
  is not to be done.”
'6': >-
  “How could we be able to offer him dishonour?” Hearing those words of theirs,
  uttered in agitation of anger,
'7': >-
  the king again spoke this word to them: “I have been rejected by the Blessed
  One (my preceptor), and likewise by the sons of my guru as well.”
'8': >-
  “I shall go to another refuge. Welfare be to you, O you whose wealth is
  tapas.” But the sons of the Ṛṣi, hearing that speech, fierce in its import,
'9': >-
  cursed him in utmost fury: “You shall become a caṇḍāla!” Having thus spoken,
  those great-souled ones entered each into his own hermitage.
'10': >-
  Then, when the night had passed, the king became a caṇḍāla—clad in blue
  garments, blue in hue, a man with his hair fallen away (dishevelled and
  ruined).
'11': >-
  He wore garlands and unguents fit for the funeral-pyre, and became adorned
  with ornaments of iron. Seeing him, all the ministers, abandoning the one who
  bore the caṇḍāla-form,
'12': >-
  fled together, O Rāma—(as did) the citizens who had been his followers. Alone,
  indeed, that king of the Kakutsthas went forth, great-souled.
'13': >-
  Burning day and night (with distress), he went to Viśvāmitra, the ascetic rich
  in penance. Viśvāmitra, seeing that king brought to naught,
'14': >-
  and wearing the form of a caṇḍāla, O Rāma, was moved to compassion. Out of
  compassion that mighty, supremely righteous sage,
'15': >-
  spoke this word, for his good, to the king of dreadful appearance: “What is
  it, O king’s son of great strength, that has brought you here?”
'16': >-
  “O hero, lord of Ayodhyā—(have you) through a curse, become a caṇḍāla?” Then,
  hearing that utterance, the king who had become a caṇḍāla
'17': >-
  spoke with joined palms—he who knew speech—addressing him who was skilled in
  speech: “I have been rejected by my guru, and likewise by the sons of my
  guru.”
'18': >-
  “Without attaining that desire, a reversal has befallen me. I wish to go to
  heaven with this very body, O you of gentle countenance.”
'19': >-
  “I have performed a hundred sacrifices, yet their fruit is not obtained. Never
  before have I spoken untruth, nor shall I ever speak it.”
'20': >-
  “Even when I have fallen into hardships, O gentle one, I stand by
  kṣatriya-dharma, I swear to you. By sacrifices of many kinds I have
  worshipped, and my subjects have been protected according to dharma.”
'21': >-
  “The gurus also, great-souled ones, have been pleased by my good conduct and
  righteous manner of life; yet, though I strive in dharma and desire to bring
  about the sacrifice,
'22': >-
  the gurus do not attain satisfaction, O bull among sages. I deem fate alone to
  be supreme, and human effort to be without purpose.”
'23': >-
  “Everything is overpowered by fate; fate indeed is the highest resort.
  Therefore, for me—afflicted beyond measure—who seeks your favour, you should
  act, for your good be it, since my actions have been struck down by fate.”
'24': >-
  “I shall not go to any other refuge; there is no other shelter for me. By
  human endeavour you ought to turn back this fate.”
'25': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-eighth sarga of the Bāla-kāṇḍa in the Ṛṣi Vālmīki’s holy
  Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, entitled “The Curse of Triśaṅku.”
