  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-seventh chapter, called “The Display of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa Bound by
  Nāga-Serpents.”
'1': >-
  When the son of Rāvaṇa (Indrajit), having entered Laṅkā and having
  accomplished his purpose, (had departed), the foremost of the Vānaras then
  surrounded Rāghava and kept vigilant guard over him.
'2': >-
  Hanumān, Aṅgada, Nīla, Suṣeṇa, Kumuda, Nala; Gaja, Gavākṣa, Gavaya, Śarabha,
  and Gandhamādana—
'3': >-
  Jāmbavān, Ṛṣabha, Skandha, Rambha, Śatabali, and Pṛthu—together with other
  troops arranged in battle-order, stood ready on every side, taking up trees
  (as their weapons).
'4': >-
  The Vānaras, watching all directions—sideways, above, and around—imagined,
  “These are Rākṣasas,” even when they saw the slightest movement in grass and
  blades of straw.
'5': >-
  Rāvaṇa too, highly delighted at having dispatched his son Indrajit, then
  summoned at once those Rākṣasīs who guarded Sītā.
'6': >-
  Those Rākṣasīs, including Trijaṭā, came before him in obedience to his
  command; then the lord of the Rākṣasas, pleased, addressed them.
'7': >-
  “Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa have been slain in battle by Indrajit of renowned prowess.
  Place Vaidehī upon that Puṣpaka and show her the two, lying dead upon the
  battlefield.
'8': >-
  “Depending upon whom she stands firm, she does not attend upon me. That
  husband of hers, along with his brother, has been slain on the very forefront
  of the battle.”
'9': >-
  “Now Maithilī—free from doubt, free from agitation, and without any other
  hope—will attend upon me; Sītā will come to me adorned with all ornaments.”
'10': >-
  “Today, seeing Rāma with Lakṣmaṇa brought under the power of Time on the
  battlefield, she will withdraw (from her former resolve), finding no other
  course open to her.”
'11': >-
  “That large-eyed lady, with no other expectation, will of her own accord
  attend upon me.” Having heard that speech of evil-souled Rāvaṇa,
'12': >-
  those Rākṣasīs replied, “So be it,” and went indeed to where the Puṣpaka was.
  Then, by Rāvaṇa’s command, the Rākṣasīs brought the Puṣpaka (air-car).
'13': >-
  They approached Maithilī, who was staying in the Aśoka grove. Taking
  Sītā—overpowered by sorrow for her lord—
'14': >-
  the Rākṣasīs then made her ascend the Puṣpaka aerial chariot. Then, having
  placed Sītā on the Puṣpaka together with Trijaṭā,
'15': >-
  the Rākṣasīs set out to show her Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. And Rāvaṇa caused the city
  to be paraded as if in triumph, decked with banners and festoons of flags,
'16': >-
  and, rejoicing, the lord of the Rākṣasas proclaimed throughout Laṅkā: “Rāghava
  and Lakṣmaṇa have been slain in battle by Indrajit!”
'17': >-
  Going by the aerial chariot, Sītā with Trijaṭā beheld the entire army of
  Vānaras lying struck down (upon the ground).
'18': >-
  She also saw the flesh-eating Rākṣasas exultant at heart, and the Vānaras,
  tormented by extreme grief, near the side of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.
'19': >-
  Then Sītā saw both of them—Lakṣmaṇa and Rāma—lying upon beds of arrows,
  unconscious, afflicted by the torment of shafts.
'20': >-
  Those heroes had their armor shattered; their bows and weapons were pierced
  through; their bodies were cut all over by missiles; they lay on the earth
  like thickets and heaps of arrows.
'21': >-
  Seeing those two brothers there—eminent heroes, best of men—lying thus,
  lotus-eyed, like two youthful sons of the Fire-god,
'22': >-
  those mighty men, resting upon beds of arrows and reduced to such a
  state—Sītā, afflicted with grief, lamented piteously and again and again.
'23': >-
  Beholding her husband of faultless limbs and Lakṣmaṇa, and seeing them moving
  and twitching in the dust, the daughter of Janaka, dark-eyed, burst into
  tears.
'24': >-
  Struck by sorrow and tears, looking upon those two brothers whose splendor was
  like that of sons of the gods, and conjecturing their death, she—overwhelmed
  with grief—spoke these words.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the forty-seventh chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Display of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
  Bound by Nāga-Serpents.”
