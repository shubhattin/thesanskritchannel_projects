  Now begins the eighty-fourth canto in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Description of Vṛtra’s Austerities.”
'1': >-
  When Rāma had thus spoken, and when Bharata, the great-souled one, was
  present, Lakṣmaṇa then addressed the delighter of the Raghus with these
  auspicious words.
'2': >-
  The Aśvamedha, the great sacrifice, is purifying, destroying all sins. May
  that purifier, irresistible one, be pleasing to you, O delight of the Raghus.
'3': >-
  For an ancient event is heard of, concerning Vāsava (Indra), the very
  great-souled: Śakra, covered over with the sin of slaying a Brāhmaṇa, was
  purified by the Horse-sacrifice.
'4': >-
  Of old indeed, O mighty-armed one, at the great encounter of gods and asuras,
  there was a great Daitya named Vṛtra, renowned in the worlds.
'5': >-
  He was spread out to the breadth of a hundred yojanas, and in height he rose
  to thrice that measure; and, through affection and love, he looked upon the
  three worlds everywhere.
'6': >-
  He was a knower of dharma, and grateful, and firmly established in wisdom;
  well-composed in mind, he ruled the flourishing earth in accordance with
  dharma.
'7': >-
  While he was ruling thus at that time, the earth, yielding every desire,
  produced rich essences—abundant roots and fruits as well.
'8': >-
  The earth became well-provided for that great-souled one, bearing crops
  without being tilled; and he enjoyed such a prosperous kingdom, wondrous to
  behold.
'9': >-
  Then in him there arose this resolve: “Let me perform unsurpassed austerity;
  for austerity indeed is the supreme good, whereas other pleasures are
  delusion.”
'10': >-
  Having entrusted his eldest son—sweetly disposed toward the citizens—among the
  townsmen, he undertook fierce austerities, tormenting all the deities by the
  power of his penance.
'11': >-
  But while Vṛtra was engaged in austerity, Vāsava (Indra) became exceedingly
  distressed; approaching Viṣṇu, he spoke these words.
'12': >-
  “By this asceticism, O mighty-armed one, the worlds have been conquered by
  Vṛtra. He is powerful and righteous-souled; I shall not be able to restrain or
  govern him.”
'13': >-
  “If that lord of asuras should take up austerity still further, then for as
  long as the worlds endure, so long will they remain obedient to his control.”
'14': >-
  “And yet you neglect this most generous and mighty one! For Vṛtra would not
  last even for a moment, O lord of the gods, if you were to become wrathful.”
'15': >-
  “Indeed, O Viṣṇu, from the time you came into union of favor and friendship
  with him, from that time onward he attained lordship over the worlds.”
'16': >-
  “Therefore, being well-composed, grant protection and favor to the worlds; for
  by your act alone everything in the universe becomes tranquil and free from
  affliction.”
'17': >-
  “All these dwellers in heaven, O Viṣṇu, are looking to you; render them aid in
  this great matter—the slaying of Vṛtra.”
'18': >-
  “For you have ever rendered help to these great-souled ones; this is
  unbearable for others—of those who have no refuge, you are the refuge, you are
  their sole course.”
'19': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-fourth canto of the Uttara Kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the illustrious Ādikāvya, entitled “The Description of Vṛtra’s
  Austerities.”
