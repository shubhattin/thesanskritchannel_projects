'0': Om. Salutations to the Supreme Self (Paramatman).
'1': Now begins the Bhagavad Gita, the holy song of the Blessed Lord.
'2': >-
  Now, the Fourth Chapter: The Yoga of Renunciation of Action through Knowledge
  (Jnana–Karma-Sannyasa Yoga).
'3': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'4': >-
  This imperishable Yoga I taught to Vivasvan (the Sun-god); Vivasvan declared
  it to Manu; Manu spoke it to Ikshvaku.
'5': >-
  Thus, handed down through the succession of teachers, the royal sages knew
  this Yoga. But by the long passage of time here, O scorcher of foes, this Yoga
  has been lost (to the world).
'6': >-
  That same ancient Yoga has today been declared by Me to you; for you are My
  devotee and My friend—therefore this is indeed the supreme secret.
'7': 'Arjuna said:'
'8': >-
  Your birth is later, while the birth of Vivasvan is earlier. How am I to
  understand that in the beginning You taught this?
'9': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'10': >-
  Many births of Mine have passed, and yours also, O Arjuna. I know them all,
  but you do not know them, O scorcher of foes.
'11': >-
  Though I am unborn and of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all
  beings, yet, presiding over My own Prakriti, I come into manifestation by My
  own divine power (atma-maya).
'12': >-
  Whenever there is decline of dharma, O Bharata, and the rising up of adharma,
  then I manifest Myself.
'13': >-
  For the protection of the righteous, for the destruction of the evil-doers,
  and for the establishment of dharma, I come into being age after age.
'14': >-
  He who thus knows in truth the divine nature of My birth and My action—having
  cast off the body, he is not born again; he comes to Me, O Arjuna.
'15': >-
  Freed from attachment, fear, and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in
  Me—many, purified by the austerity of knowledge, have attained My state (My
  being).
'16': >-
  In whatever way men approach Me, in that same way do I receive them. All men,
  O Partha, follow My path in every manner.
'17': >-
  Desiring success in actions, men here worship the deities; for in the human
  world success born of action is quickly attained.
'18': >-
  The fourfold order (chaturvarnya) was created by Me according to the divisions
  of qualities (gunas) and actions (karma). Though I am its creator, know Me to
  be the non-doer and imperishable.
'19': >-
  Actions do not taint Me; nor have I any longing for the fruits of actions. He
  who thus knows Me is not bound by actions.
'20': >-
  Knowing this, the seekers of liberation in ancient times also performed
  action. Therefore you too perform action, as was done by the ancients in
  former times.
'21': >-
  What is action, and what is inaction? Even the wise are bewildered here.
  Therefore I shall tell you what action is, knowing which you shall be freed
  from evil.
'22': >-
  For one must understand action; one must also understand forbidden or wrong
  action (vikarma); and one must understand inaction. Mysterious indeed is the
  course of action.
'23': >-
  He who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction—he is wise among men;
  he is a yogin and a doer of all actions (in the right spirit).
'24': >-
  He whose every undertaking is devoid of desire and self-willed intention,
  whose actions have been burnt up in the fire of knowledge—him the wise call a
  sage.
'25': >-
  Having abandoned attachment to the fruits of action, ever content, dependent
  on nothing—though engaged in action, he does not in truth do anything at all.
'26': >-
  Free from expectation, with mind and self controlled, having abandoned all
  possessions—performing action only for the maintenance of the body, he incurs
  no sin.
'27': >-
  Content with whatever comes unasked, rising above the pairs of opposites, free
  from envy, even-minded in success and failure—though he acts, he is not bound.
'28': >-
  Of one who is free from attachment, who is liberated, whose mind is
  established in knowledge—his action, performed as sacrifice, is wholly
  dissolved.
'29': >-
  The offering is Brahman; the oblation is Brahman; it is offered by Brahman
  into the fire of Brahman. Brahman alone is to be attained by him who is
  absorbed in Brahman in action.
'30': >-
  Some yogins worship by sacrifice to the deities alone; others offer sacrifice
  itself as sacrifice in the fire of Brahman.
'31': >-
  Some offer the senses—hearing and the rest—into the fires of restraint; others
  offer the objects of sense—sound and the rest—into the fires of the senses.
'32': >-
  Others offer all the functions of the senses and also the functions of the
  vital force (prana) into the fire of the Yoga of self-control, kindled by
  knowledge.
'33': >-
  Some are sacrificers through material offerings; some through austerity; some
  through yoga; and others, ascetics of steadfast vows, through the sacrifice of
  sacred study and of knowledge.
'34': >-
  Some offer the outgoing breath (apana) into the incoming breath (prana); and
  others the incoming breath into the outgoing breath—restraining the courses of
  prana and apana, devoted to the discipline of breath-control (pranayama).
'35': >-
  Others, regulated in food, offer the life-breaths into the life-breaths. All
  these are knowers of sacrifice, and by sacrifice their impurities are
  destroyed.
'36': >-
  Those who partake of the nectar that remains after sacrifice attain the
  eternal Brahman. Even this world is not for one who does not sacrifice—how
  then the other (world), O best of the Kurus?
'37': >-
  Thus, many kinds of sacrifice are spread out from the mouth of Brahman (as
  declared in the Vedas). Know them all to be born of action; knowing thus, you
  shall be liberated.
'38': >-
  Superior to a sacrifice made of material offerings is the sacrifice of
  knowledge, O scorcher of foes. All action whatsoever, O Partha, finds its
  consummation in knowledge.
'39': >-
  Know that by prostration, by questioning, and by service. The wise who see the
  truth will instruct you in knowledge.
'40': >-
  Knowing that, you shall not again fall into such delusion, O Pandava; by that
  knowledge you shall see all beings without remainder in your own Self—and also
  in Me.
'41': >-
  Even if you are the most sinful of all sinners, yet by the boat of knowledge
  alone you shall cross over all sin.
'42': >-
  As a blazing fire reduces firewood to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of
  knowledge reduce all actions to ashes.
'43': >-
  For in this world there is nothing so purifying as knowledge. He who is
  perfected in Yoga finds that (knowledge) in the Self, in due time.
'44': >-
  The man of faith attains knowledge—devoted to it, with senses restrained.
  Having obtained knowledge, he swiftly attains supreme peace.
'45': >-
  But the ignorant, the faithless, and the doubting self perishes. Neither this
  world nor the next, nor happiness, is for the doubting self.
'46': >-
  For one who has renounced actions through Yoga, whose doubts are cut asunder
  by knowledge, who is possessed of the Self—actions do not bind him, O
  Dhananjaya.
'47': >-
  Therefore, with the sword of knowledge, cut asunder this doubt born of
  ignorance, seated in your heart. Take refuge in Yoga; arise, O Bharata!
'48': >-
  Om—That is Truth—thus in the Bhagavad Gita, among the Upanishads, in the
  science of Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue between Sri
  Krishna and Arjuna, ends the Fourth Chapter, entitled “The Yoga of
  Renunciation of Action through Knowledge.”
