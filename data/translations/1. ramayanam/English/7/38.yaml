  Now, in the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Uttara-Kanda, the thirty-eighth
  chapter, entitled “The Return-Journey of Janaka and the Other Kings.”
'1': >-
  Thus did the mighty-armed Raghava dwell, day after day, administering and
  overseeing all affairs, both among the citizens of the city and the people of
  the provinces.
'2': >-
  Then, after some days had passed, Raghava, with joined palms, addressed this
  speech to Janaka, the lord of Mithila of Videha.
'3': >-
  “You indeed are our steady refuge and unfaltering course; by you have we been
  protected. And by the foremost splendour of your majesty, Ravana was slain by
  me.”
'4': >-
  “Among all the Ikshvakus, and among all the men of Mithila in every way, O
  king, there are incomparable joys—foremost among them the joy arising from our
  relationship by marriage.”
'5': >-
  “Therefore, O sovereign, return to your own city, taking with you the precious
  treasures; and Bharata also shall follow behind you, for your assistance.”
'6': >-
  Thus saying ‘So be it,’ the king replied to Raghava: “I am pleased, O king, by
  your presence, and by your conduct as well.”
'7': >-
  “As for these jewels and treasures that have indeed been gathered for my
  sake—O king, all of them I give to my daughter.”
'8': >-
  Having spoken thus to Kakutstha, Janaka, his heart delighted, departed for
  splendid Mithila, after taking leave of Raghava with his permission.
'9': >-
  Then, when Janaka had departed, the lord Raghava, with joined palms, addressed
  these words to Yudhajit, the maternal uncle from Kekaya.
'10': >-
  “This kingdom, and I myself, and Bharata together with Lakshmana—are dependent
  upon you, O king; for you are our refuge and our guiding course, O bull among
  men.”
'11': >-
  “For the aged king will fall into distress on your account; therefore it seems
  fitting that you should depart this very day, O sovereign.”
'12': >-
  “Lakshmana will follow behind, accompanying you; taking abundant wealth and
  jewels of many kinds.”
'13': >-
  Then Yudhajit replied ‘So be it’ to Raghava regarding the journey, and said:
  “Let the jewels and the wealth be inexhaustible in you alone.”
'14': >-
  The increaser of Kekaya’s prosperity then circumambulated the king (in
  reverence). He had formerly been thus honoured by Rama—being saluted and
  circumambulated.
'15': >-
  The lord of Kekaya departed with Lakshmana as his helper—like Vasava (Indra)
  together with Vishnu, after the Asura Vritra had been slain.
'16': >-
  Having then dismissed him, Rama—embracing his friend Pratardana, the lord of
  Kashi, who was free from fear—spoke these words.
'17': >-
  “By you has affection been shown; the highest friendship has been displayed;
  and great effort has been undertaken, O king, by you together with Bharata.”
'18': >-
  “Therefore, O king of Kashi, go today to your city, Varānasi—delightful,
  well-guarded by you, radiant with splendour, and adorned with noble gateways.”
'19': >-
  Having said so, Kakutstha, the righteous-souled, rose from his excellent seat
  and embraced him closely, pressing him to his bosom without pause.
'20': >-
  Then Kausalya’s joy-enhancer (Rama) dismissed him. With Raghava’s permission,
  the fearless lord of Kashi swiftly went to Varānasi, being sent off by
  Raghava.
'21': >-
  After dismissing the lord of Kashi and the three hundred kings of the earth,
  Raghava, smiling, spoke words of gentle syllables.
'22': >-
  “Your unwavering affection has been safeguarded by your own splendour; and
  among you, dharma is ever firmly established, and truth is always present.”
'23': >-
  “By your might and by the splendour of you great-souled kings, the
  evil-minded, wicked-intentioned Ravana—the vilest of rakshasas—has been
  slain.”
'24': >-
  “There I was only the apparent instrument; by your splendour Ravana, together
  with his hosts, was slain in battle—along with his sons, ministers, and
  kinsmen.”
'25': >-
  “And you were all brought here by the great-souled Bharata, upon hearing that
  the daughter of King Janaka had been carried off from the forest.”
'26': >-
  “For all you great-souled kings who have been exerting yourselves, a very long
  time has passed; therefore I now approve your departure.”
'27': >-
  Then the kings, encompassed by great joy, replied to him: “Fortunate indeed
  that you are victorious, O Rama, and established in your own rightful kingdom
  as well.”
'28': >-
  “Fortunate indeed that Sita has been brought back; fortunate indeed that the
  enemy has been overcome. This is our highest desire; this is our supreme
  delight—”
'29': “—that we behold you, O Rama, victorious and with your foes slain.”
'30': >-
  “And it is fitting in you that you praise us so; yet we do not know ourselves
  to be worthy of such praise, nor how to speak praise of this kind.”
'31': >-
  “We take leave; we shall depart. You abide ever in our hearts. We shall go, O
  mighty-armed one, encompassed here by great joy; and may your affection toward
  us, O great king, be always enduring.”
'32': >-
  All the kings, filled with the highest gladness, saying “So be it,” with
  joined palms addressed Raghava, eager to depart.
'33': And having been duly honoured by Rama, they went, each to his own land.
'34': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-eighth chapter, entitled “The Return-Journey of Janaka
  and the Other Kings,” in the Uttara-Kanda of the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, the
  Primeval Epic.
