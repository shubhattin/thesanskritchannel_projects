  Now begins the Seventieth Sarga, named “The Establishment of Madhu City
  (Mathurā)”, in the Uttarakāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  When Lavaṇa had been slain, the Devas—together with Indra and with Agni at
  their head—addressed Shatrughna, the afflicter of foes, in words most sweet
  and gracious.
'2': >-
  “By good fortune is thy victory, dear child; by good fortune is Lavaṇa the
  Rākṣasa slain! O tiger among men, choose a boon—ask for the best, O thou of
  excellent vows.”
'3': >-
  “All of us have come here as bestowers of boons, O mighty-armed one, desiring
  thy triumph; indeed, our appearing before thee shall not be fruitless.”
'4': >-
  Hearing the speech of the Devas, that hero, Shatrughna—great-armed and
  self-controlled—answered them with joined palms placed upon his head in
  reverence.
'5': >-
  “Here is Madhu City, delightful and sweet, a city fashioned by the Devas. May
  I quickly obtain its establishment and settlement—let this be my supreme
  boon.”
'6': >-
  To him, the Rāghava, the Devas—pleased in mind—replied, “So be it!” “A lovely
  city shall arise; it shall be (the city of) Śūrasenā—of this there is no
  doubt.”
'7': >-
  Having spoken thus, those great-souled ones then ascended to heaven. And
  Shatrughna too, of great splendour, brought forward and led on that army.
'8': >-
  That army, hearing Shatrughna’s command, came swiftly. And Shatrughna began
  the work of settlement and establishment in the month of Śrāvaṇa.
'9': >-
  In the auspicious twelfth year, that city—shining with a divine radiance—was
  duly established; and the realm of the Śūrasenās became free from danger on
  every side.
'10': >-
  The fields were rich with crops; Vāsava (Indra) sent rain in its proper
  season. The people were free from disease and full of valour, protected by the
  mighty arms of Shatrughna.
'11': >-
  Resembling a half-moon in its form, and beautified by the banks of the Yamunā,
  it was adorned with chief and excellent mansions, with squares, markets, and
  streets; inhabited by the four varṇas, and graced with diverse trade and
  commerce.
'12': >-
  And that great, fair construction which Lavaṇa had formerly made
  there—Shatrughna further embellished it, adorning it with many colours and
  varied splendours.
'13': >-
  It shone on every side with gardens and pleasure-grounds, and was beautified
  with things worthy to behold—both those wrought by divine skill and those
  fashioned by men.
'14': >-
  That city, radiant like something celestial, resplendent with goods and wares
  of many kinds, was also adorned by merchants arriving from many lands and
  regions.
'15': >-
  Shatrughna, younger brother of Bharata, himself rich in prosperity, beheld
  that flourishing city; and, supremely delighted, he attained the highest joy.
'16': >-
  Then this thought arose in him: “Having established the city of Mathurā, when
  the twelve years have come to their completion, I shall go to behold the feet
  of Rāma.”
'17': >-
  Therefore, having settled that city—like unto a city of the immortals—thronged
  with people of many kinds, the king, increaser of the Raghu line, fixed his
  mind upon beholding the feet of Rāma, the lord of the Raghus.
'18': >-
  Thus ends the Seventieth Sarga, named “The Establishment of Madhu City
  (Mathurā)”, in the Uttarakāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the First
  Poem.
