  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇyakāṇḍa, the twenty-seventh
  canto, called “The Slaying of Triśiras.”
'1': >-
  But as Khara, the commander of the host, was advancing facing Rāma, the
  rākṣasa named Triśiras drew near and spoke these words:
'2': >-
  “Appoint me—valiant as I am—to this task; you withdraw from this rash venture.
  Behold great-armed Rāma laid low in battle!”
'3': >-
  “I promise you this in truth, and I take up my weapon: in such wise will I
  slay Rāma—who is worthy to be slain by all the rākṣasas.”
'4': >-
  “Either I shall be his death in the fight, or he shall be my death in the
  battle. Restrain your eagerness for combat, and for a brief moment remain as a
  spectator.”
'5': >-
  “If Rāma is slain, you shall go with delight to Janasthāna; or if I am slain,
  then you shall go forth to join battle with Rāma.”
'6': >-
  Thus soothed by Triśiras, Khara—out of greed for death (for the prospect of
  slaying Rāma)—gave him leave, saying, “Go, fight!” and Triśiras set out toward
  Rāghava.
'7': >-
  Then Triśiras, seated in a radiant chariot yoked with horses, charged upon
  Rāma in battle, like a three-peaked mountain.
'8': >-
  Pouring forth volleys of arrows like a great cloud, he sent up a sound like
  the resounding of a drum drenched with water.
'9': >-
  Seeing the rākṣasa Triśiras coming on, Rāghava seized his bow, shaking forth
  his keen arrows.
'10': >-
  Then there arose a tumultuous encounter between Rāma and Triśiras—those two
  exceedingly mighty ones—like that of a lion and an elephant.
'11': >-
  Thereupon, struck on the forehead by three arrows shot by Triśiras, Rāma,
  intolerant of affront and filled with wrath, spoke these words in fury:
'12': >-
  “Ah! Such strength indeed belongs to this rākṣasa, a hero of prowess—since I
  am, as it were, wounded upon the forehead by arrows like flowers!”
'13': >-
  “Receive, on your part, my arrows too, discharged from the bow-string!” Saying
  so, greatly enraged, he let fly arrows like poisonous serpents.
'14': >-
  Enraged, he smote Triśiras on the chest with fourteen arrows; and with four
  arrows, having well-bent joints, he struck down his horses.
'15': >-
  The illustrious Rāma brought down his four steeds; and with eight arrows he
  struck down the charioteer upon the seat of the car.
'16': >-
  And with an arrow Rāma cut down his lofty-raised banner. Then, as that
  night-ranger sprang up from the chariot that had been destroyed,
'17': >-
  Rāma, of immeasurable prowess, cut him with arrows, striking his heart; and he
  became stunned—while Rāma, filled with indignation at that rākṣasa, pressed
  him hard with shafts.
'18': >-
  With three swift arrows he struck off his three heads. Crushed by Rāma’s
  arrows, he spewed smoke and blood,
'19': >-
  and that night-ranger fell upon the battlefield, upon those already fallen
  before. Then the remaining rākṣasas, broken, who had relied on Khara,
'20': >-
  fled—no longer standing their ground—like deer terrified by a tiger. Seeing
  them fleeing, Khara, angered, quickly checked them, and then rushed straight
  at Rāma, like Rāhu rushing upon the moon.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-seventh canto in the Araṇyakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, called “The Slaying of Triśiras.”
