  Now begins the Seventh Sarga of the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Sight of the Puṣpaka (Vimāna).”
'1': >-
  That mighty one beheld a vast complex of mansions, netted and latticed with
  inlaid vaidūrya (cat’s‑eye) gems and with gold—like a great canopy of
  rain-clouds in the season of downpour, enwreathed with lightning and filled
  with flights of birds.
'2': >-
  He saw many kinds of residences and halls—armouries for chief conches,
  weapons, and bows; and also broad and charming moonlit terraces (candraśālās)
  upon the lofty mansion-peaks.
'3': >-
  The monkey beheld houses adorned with diverse splendours, honoured even by
  Devas and Asuras, free from every defect, and obtained through the might of
  their lord.
'4': >-
  Those dwellings—carefully planned and perfectly arranged, as though fashioned
  directly by Maya himself—standing on the earth yet surpassing in every
  excellence, he beheld as belonging to the lord of Laṅkā.
'5': >-
  Then he saw an excellent mansion, rising like a lofty cloud—enchanting, of
  lovely golden form—befitting the strength of the lord of the Rākṣasas,
  incomparable in beauty.
'6': >-
  Scattered over the earth like a piece of heaven, blazing with prosperity,
  strewn with many jewels; showered with blossoms from trees of many kinds—like
  a mountain-peak dusted over with ruddy pollen.
'7': >-
  Shining as though with ranks of noble women; worshipped as it were by
  lightning-flashes in the rain-clouds; borne along as though by flocks of royal
  swans—an aerial car wrought by merit, endowed with splendour, moving in the
  sky.
'8': >-
  Like a mountain-summit variegated with many minerals, like the sky adorned
  with planets and the moon—so he beheld that vimāna, beautifully contrived,
  patterned like charming clouds, and richly inlaid with many gems.
'9': >-
  Therein the earth itself was made full of ranges of mountains; the mountains
  were made full of canopies of trees; the trees were made full of canopies of
  flowers; and the flowers were made complete with filaments and petals.
'10': >-
  There were fashioned pale and shining mansions; and likewise lotus-pools
  abounding in fair blossoms; again, lotuses with their filaments; and
  variegated forests and lakes.
'11': >-
  That great vimāna, resplendent, bearing the name “Puṣpaka,” whirling with the
  radiance of gems, and towering even above the loftiest of mansions—this the
  great monkey beheld there.
'12': >-
  There were birds fashioned of vaidūrya; and birds also of silver and coral.
  There were bright serpents wrought of many precious substances; and
  well-limbed steeds, auspicious in form, made according to their natural kinds.
'13': >-
  With wings like blossoms of coral and jāmbūnada-gold, and with curved wings as
  though dipping into water—those well-faced, fair-winged birds, fashioned
  there, shone like Kāma himself made visible.
'14': >-
  Elephants, fair-trunked, were set as though in harness; their trunks were like
  lotuses with filaments, like hands bearing lotus-leaves. And there was a
  goddess as though Lakṣmī herself, made with auspicious hands—Lotus-lady,
  lotus-handed.
'15': >-
  Thus, having approached that splendid mansion, he gazed upon it in wonder—like
  a mountain with beautiful caverns. And again, it appeared supremely fragrant
  and fair—like a mountain with lovely caves when the snows have passed.
'16': >-
  Then that monkey, ranging through the city guarded by the arms of Ten-faced
  Rāvaṇa—having sprung onward and entered that honoured place—did not behold
  Janaka’s daughter, though she was worthy of highest reverence, now exceedingly
  sorrowful, overwhelmed by the force of her husband’s virtues.
'17': >-
  Therefore, as that great-souled one of many disciplined reflections,
  self-controlled and steadfast on the right path, wandered about with his very
  eyes searching—because he did not see Janaka’s daughter, his mind became
  exceedingly distressed.
'18': >-
  Thus ends the Seventh Sarga of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the venerable, holy
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first poet—entitled “The Sight of the
  Puṣpaka (Vimāna).”
