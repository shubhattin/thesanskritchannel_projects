  Now, in the illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, within the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-twentieth sarga, entitled “The Hymn to Rāma composed by
  Brahmā.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, his mind distressed on hearing such words spoken, pondered for a
  moment—he, the righteous-souled one—his eyes troubled and filled with tears.
'2': >-
  Thereupon came the king Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera), and Yama together with the Pitṛs;
  and the thousand-eyed Lord of the gods (Indra), and Varuṇa, the sovereign of
  the waters.
'3': >-
  And the glorious three-eyed one (Śiva), the great Deva, whose banner bears the
  bull; and Brahmā, the creator of the whole world, the foremost among those who
  know Brahman.
'4': >-
  All these, assembling and arriving in aerial cars resplendent like the sun,
  came to the city of Laṅkā and approached Rāghava.
'5': >-
  Then the best among the Thirty-three gods, raising their mighty arms adorned
  with thousands of ornaments, spoke to Rāghava, who stood with joined palms.
'6': >-
  “You are the maker of the entire world, the supreme Lord, the greatest among
  the knowers of knowledge. How is it that you disregard Sītā as she falls into
  the blazing fire? And how is it that you do not recognize your own self—the
  foremost among the hosts of gods?”
'7': >-
  “You are of true splendor; formerly you were Vasu, and the lord of the Vasus;
  and you are the self-effulgent primal creator of the three worlds.”
'8': >-
  “You are the eighth among the Rudras, and the fifth among the Sādhyas. The
  Aśvins are your two ears, and the sun and the moon are your two eyes.”
'9': >-
  “At the end, at the beginning, and in the middle you are seen, O scorcher of
  foes; and yet you disregard Vaidehī, as though you were an ordinary man of
  common nature.”
'10': >-
  Thus addressed by those guardians of the worlds, Rāghava—the Lord of the
  world—Rāma, best among uphold­ers of dharma, spoke to the foremost among the
  gods:
'11': >-
  “I consider myself to be a human being—Rāma, the son of Daśaratha. Who I truly
  am, and whence I am—let the Blessed One declare that to me.”
'12': >-
  When the Kakutstha thus spoke, Brahmā, foremost among those who know Brahman,
  replied: “Hear my words, O you whose valor is truth itself—words that are
  true.”
'13': >-
  “You are Nārāyaṇa, the radiant Lord, the sovereign who bears the discus as his
  weapon. You are the single-tusked Boar (Varāha), the conqueror of all that is
  and all that shall be, and of every rival.”
'14': >-
  “You are the imperishable, Brahman; you are truth—in the middle and at the end
  as well, O Rāghava. You are the supreme dharma of the worlds; you are
  Viṣvaksena, four-armed.”
'15': >-
  “Bearing the Śārṅga bow, you are Hṛṣīkeśa; you are the Puruṣa, the Supreme
  Person. You are unconquered; sword-bearing, you are Viṣṇu; and you are Kṛṣṇa,
  of vast strength.”
'16': >-
  “You are the commander of hosts and the leader of multitudes; you are
  intellect; you are the essence of goodness (sattva); you are forbearance, and
  self-restraint. You are both origin and dissolution; you are Upendra, the
  slayer of Madhu.”
'17': >-
  “Your deeds are those of Indra; you are the great Indra; you are Padmanābha,
  the bringer of battle’s end. The divine great seers proclaim you to be the
  refuge, and the very act of taking refuge.”
'18': >-
  “Thousand-horned, of the very nature of the Vedas, hundred-headed, the great
  bull among sages—you are indeed the self-effulgent primal creator of the three
  worlds.”
'19': >-
  “You are the support even of the Siddhas and the Sādhyas, and their ancient
  forebear. You are the sacrifice; you are the Vaṣaṭ-cry; you are Oṃkāra, beyond
  the beyond.”
'20': >-
  “Men do not know your origin nor your end—who you truly are. You are beheld in
  all beings, and in cows, and in brāhmaṇas as well.”
'21': >-
  “In all directions, in the sky, in mountains and in rivers—you are the
  auspicious One with a thousand feet, a hundred heads, and a thousand eyes.”
'22': >-
  “You uphold all beings, the earth and all its mountains. At the end of the
  earth, in the waters, you are seen as the great serpent.”
'23': >-
  “Sustaining the three worlds—gods, gandharvas, and dānavas—O Rāma, I am your
  heart, and the goddess Sarasvatī is your tongue.”
'24': >-
  “The gods are the hairs upon the limbs of your body, O Lord—created by Brahmā.
  Your blinking is called the night, and your opening of the eyes is likewise
  the day.”
'25': >-
  “The Vedas became your consecrations; nothing exists without you. The entire
  universe is your body; the surface of the earth is your steadfastness.”
'26': >-
  “Agni is your wrath; your favor is Soma, marked with the Śrīvatsa sign.
  Formerly you strode across the three worlds with your three strides.”
'27': >-
  “And Mahendra was made king, after binding the fierce Bali. Sītā is Lakṣmī;
  you are Viṣṇu—the divine Kṛṣṇa, the Lord of creatures.”
'28': >-
  “For the slaying of Rāvaṇa you have here entered a human body. Thus this task
  of ours has been accomplished by you, O best among uphold­ers of dharma.”
'29': >-
  “Rāvaṇa has been slain, O Rāma; ascend to heaven rejoicing. Unfailing is your
  divine prowess; not in vain are your valorous deeds.”
'30': >-
  “Unfailing is the sight of you, O Rāma; unfailing is this hymn of praise to
  you. Unfailing on earth shall be those men who are devoted to you.”
'31': >-
  “Those who, devoted, worship you—the steadfast God, the ancient Supreme
  Person—attain the objects of their desire, in this world and in the world
  hereafter as well.”
'32': >-
  “This divine, seer-composed hymn—an ancient sacred tradition—those men who
  shall recite it will have no defeat.”
'33': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-twentieth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the
  revered Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Hymn to Rāma
  composed by Brahmā.”
