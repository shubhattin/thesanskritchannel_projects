  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the Second
  Sarga, called “The Origin of the Line of Paulastya.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words of the great-souled Rāghava (Rāma), the illustrious son of
  the pitcher-born sage (Kumbhayoni, Agastya), resplendent in spiritual
  splendour, spoke these words to Rāma.
'2': >-
  “Hear, O Rāma, the course of that tale—of his vast fiery energy and might—by
  which he slew his enemies, and by which he could not be slain by his foes.”
'3': >-
  “So now, O Rāghava, I shall tell you of this lineage of Rāvaṇa—his family and
  his birth—and also of the granting of the boon, and what was bestowed upon
  him.”
'4': >-
  “Formerly, in the Kṛta Yuga, O Rāma, there was a mighty Brahmarṣi named
  Pulastya, the son of Prajāpati, like the Grandfather (Brahmā) himself made
  manifest.”
'5': >-
  “To recount his excellences—his virtues in accordance with dharma and his
  noble conduct—is not possible in full; indeed, it is only by name that one may
  say, ‘He is the son of Prajāpati.’”
'6': >-
  “By virtue of being Prajāpati’s son, that great-minded one was dear to the
  gods; and the whole world rejoiced, gladdened by his spotless virtues.”
'7': >-
  “Then that foremost of sages, on an occasion connected with dharma, went to
  the side of great Mount Meru, reached the hermitage of Tṛṇavindu, and dwelt
  there.”
'8': >-
  “That righteous-souled one practised austerity, with senses restrained and
  devoted to svādhyāya (Vedic study). Yet, when he had gone to that
  hermitage-ground, maidens began to create obstructions (to his penance).”
'9': >-
  “Maidens of the gods and of the nāgas, daughters of royal seers, and also
  apsarases at play—these came to that region.”
'10': >-
  “Because that woodland was enjoyable in every season and exceedingly lovely,
  the maidens would continually go to that place and sport there.”
'11': >-
  “And because the land was so delightful—where Pulastya, that twice-born sage,
  was—those blameless maidens, singing, playing instruments, and dancing as
  well, caused disturbance to that ascetic sage’s austerities.”
'12': >-
  “Then, angered, the greatly radiant great sage declared: ‘Whichever woman
  comes into my sight, she shall bear a child in her womb.’”
'13': >-
  “All those maidens, having heard and accepted the words of that great soul,
  were terrified by fear of the Brahman-seer’s curse and did not again set foot
  in that region.”
'14': “But the daughter of the royal seer Tṛṇavindu did not hear of that.”
'15': >-
  “She went to that hermitage-place and wandered about there, wholly fearless;
  and while she stood there, she did not see any of her girl-companions who had
  come.”
'16': >-
  “At that time the greatly radiant great ṛṣi, sprung from Prajāpati, perfected
  by austerity, was there engaged in svādhyāya.”
'17': >-
  “Hearing the sound of Vedic recitation and seeing that treasure-house of
  tapas, she became pale of body, though her form was well-proportioned and her
  limbs well-shaped.”
'18': >-
  “And she became deeply agitated, seeing that fault (this sudden change) in
  herself; thinking, ‘What is this that has come upon me?’, she went and
  remained in her father’s hermitage.”
'19': >-
  “Seeing her in that state, Tṛṇavindu then said: ‘Why do you bear upon yourself
  a form so unlike your own?’”
'20': >-
  “Then the maiden, miserable and with joined palms, spoke to her father, the
  rich in austerity: ‘I do not know, dear father, the cause by which my form has
  become thus.’”
'21': >-
  “‘But earlier I went alone to the divine hermitage of the high-souled great
  ṛṣi Pulastya, seeking to find my companions.’”
'22': >-
  “‘And there I did not see any companion who had come; and seeing this
  alteration of my appearance, I came back here in fear.’”
'23': >-
  “Then the royal seer Tṛṇavindu, whose splendour was kindled by austerity,
  entered into meditation; and in that meditation he beheld that this had arisen
  from the ṛṣi’s act.”
'24': >-
  “Understanding then that curse of the high-souled great sage, he took his
  daughter with him, went to Pulastya, and spoke these words.”
'25': >-
  “‘O Bhagavan, this daughter of mine, adorned by her own virtues, I offer to
  you as alms—pray accept her, O great sage, as she is offered of her own
  accord.’”
'26': >-
  “‘To you, who are devoted to the practice of austerities, whose senses are
  wearied in that discipline, she will ever be intent on service and
  obedience—of this there is no doubt.’”
'27': >-
  “As that righteous royal seer spoke those words, the twice-born sage—wishing
  to accept the maiden—said only, ‘So be it.’”
'28': >-
  “Having thus given her according to due rule, the kingly sage returned to his
  own hermitage; and she too dwelt there (with Pulastya), pleasing her husband
  by her virtues.”
'29': >-
  “By her good character and upright conduct, the foremost of sages was
  satisfied. Pleased, that greatly radiant one spoke this word.”
'30': >-
  “‘O fair-hipped one, I am exceedingly delighted by the wealth of your virtues.
  Therefore, O lady, today I grant you a son equal to myself.’”
'31': >-
  “‘He shall be a continuer of both our lineages, renowned by the name
  Paulastya; and because this Veda has become renowned through you while I was
  studying it…’”
'32': >-
  “‘…therefore he shall be named Viśravā—of this there is no doubt.’ Thus
  addressed, that noble lady rejoiced within, her heart filled with gladness.”
'33': >-
  “In no long time she gave birth to a son, Viśravas, famed in the three worlds,
  endowed with glory and righteousness.”
'34': >-
  “Possessed of sacred learning, impartial in vision, devoted to vows and right
  conduct, and, like his father, endowed with austerity—such was the sage
  Viśravas.”
'35': >-
  “Thus ends the Second Sarga, called “The Origin of the Line of Paulastya,” in
  the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic composed by
  Ṛṣis.”
