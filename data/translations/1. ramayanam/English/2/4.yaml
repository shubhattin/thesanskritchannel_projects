  Now begins the fourth sarga, named “The Acceptance of a Mother’s Blessing,” in
  the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  When the citizens had departed, the king once more, together with his
  ministers, deliberated with the townsmen; and being one who understood
  decision, he then arrived at a firm resolve.
'2': >-
  “Tomorrow indeed will be Puṣya; and tomorrow my son shall be consecrated—Rāma,
  lotus-petaled-eyed, as Yuvarāja,” thus declared the lord.
'3': >-
  Then King Daśaratha entered the inner apartments and, at that time, summoned
  the charioteer, saying, “Bring Rāma here again.”
'4': >-
  Receiving that command, the charioteer returned at once—swiftly to Rāma’s
  residence—in order to bring Rāma back again.
'5': >-
  The doorkeepers announced to Rāma that he had come again. Hearing it, Rāma
  too, on seeing him arrived, became filled with apprehension.
'6': >-
  Quickly admitting him, Rāma spoke these words: “Whatever the purpose of your
  coming is, tell it to me again, without leaving anything out.”
'7': >-
  Then the charioteer said to him, “The king wishes to see you. Having heard
  this authoritative message, you should go there—do not delay.”
'8': >-
  Hearing the charioteer’s words, Rāma too, moved by haste, went to the royal
  palace to see the lord of men again.
'9': >-
  Hearing that Rāma had arrived, King Daśaratha, wishing to speak what was most
  dear and excellent, had him admitted into the house.
'10': >-
  As the glorious Rāghava entered his father’s palace, he beheld his father from
  afar; and, with folded palms, he bowed down in obeisance.
'11': >-
  The ruler raised up him who was bowing, embraced him closely, and, offering
  him a seat, spoke to Rāma again:
'12': >-
  “Rāma, I am old, long-lived, and I have enjoyed pleasures as I wished; I have
  performed a hundred sacrifices rich in gifts, with abundant dakṣiṇās and with
  food in plenty, according to desire.
'13': >-
  “You are to me a beloved son, born as the cherished fruit of
  sacrifice—peerless upon the earth. I have bestowed gifts, I have offered
  sacrifices, and I have studied, O best of men.
'14': >-
  “I have experienced desirable things, and also heroic joys. I am free from
  debt to the gods, the seers, the ancestors, and the brāhmaṇas—and likewise to
  my own self.
'15': >-
  “There is nothing else left for me to do, except your consecration. Therefore,
  what I say to you now—you should do that for me.”
'16': >-
  “Today all the subjects desire you as their sovereign; therefore, my dear son,
  I shall consecrate you as Yuvarāja.”
'17': >-
  “Moreover, today, Rāma, I behold inauspicious dreams, O Rāghava; and meteors
  accompanied by thunder fall from the sky with a great roar.
'18': >-
  “And, Rāma, my star is oppressed by dreadful planets; the astrologers report
  this, speaking of the Sun, Mars, and Rāhu.
'19': >-
  “When such omens arise, for the most part a king meets with death or falls
  into a terrible calamity.
'20': >-
  “Therefore, while my mind has not yet become bewildered, O Rāghava, be
  consecrated at once; for the resolve of living beings is fickle.”
'21': >-
  “Today the Moon has passed from Puṣya to Punarvasu; and tomorrow, certainly,
  the thinkers on fate will declare the Puṣya-yoga.”
'22': >-
  “Therefore, in Puṣya be consecrated—my heart urges me on as though with haste.
  Tomorrow I shall consecrate you to the heir-apparent’s office, O tormentor of
  foes.
'23': >-
  “Therefore, from today onward, with self-control, you should observe the
  vigil, together with your wife; sleeping upon a bed of darbha-grass spread
  out.
'24': >-
  “And let your friends, vigilant, guard you on every side today; for
  undertakings of this kind are indeed beset with many obstacles.
'25': >-
  “And since Bharata is away—having gone from the city—until he returns, your
  consecration is, in my judgment, the proper course at the proper time.”
'26': >-
  “Indeed, Bharata stands established in the conduct of the righteous; he
  follows his elder brother, is devoted to dharma, compassionate, and
  self-restrained.
'27': >-
  “Yet the minds of men are, in my view, impermanent—even of the good who are
  steadfast in dharma, O Rāghava, and whose deeds are adorned with virtue.”
'28': >-
  Thus instructed and permitted regarding the consecration to take place on the
  morrow, Rāma, having bowed to his father, departed for his home.
'29': >-
  Entering his own dwelling, and having received the king’s command about the
  consecration, he immediately went out and proceeded to his mother’s inner
  apartments.
'30': >-
  There he saw his mother, clad in linen, already bowed in reverence—silent in
  speech—seeking prosperity in the shrine of the gods.
'31': >-
  Sumitrā and Lakṣmaṇa also had already come there; and Sītā too had been
  brought, on hearing the delightful news of Rāma’s consecration.
'32': >-
  Even at that time Kauśalyā stood with her eyes closed, being attended by
  Sumitrā, and by Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa.
'33': >-
  Having heard of her son’s consecration to the heir-apparent’s office on Puṣya,
  she meditated upon Janārdana, restraining the breath in prāṇāyāma.
'34': >-
  Approaching her—still observing her vows—Rāma bowed, and spoke these excellent
  words, gladdening her:
'35': >-
  “Mother, my father has appointed me to the duty of protecting the people.
  Tomorrow will be my consecration, according to my father’s command.”
'36': >-
  “Tonight Sītā too must keep the fast and vigil together with me; so have the
  teachers declared—for my father has told me so.”
'37': >-
  “Whatever auspicious preparations are suitable here for the consecration that
  will occur tomorrow—have those carried out today for me, and for Vaidehī as
  well.”
'38': >-
  Hearing this—long desired for so long—Kauśalyā spoke to Rāma these words, her
  speech choked with tears of joy:
'39': >-
  “Dear child Rāma, live long; may your adversaries be destroyed. Endow our
  kinsmen with prosperity, and gladden Sumitrā as well.”
'40': >-
  “Blessed indeed was the constellation under which you were born, my son—by
  whose virtues your father Daśaratha has been satisfied and delighted.
'41': >-
  “Fruitful indeed has been my forbearance, O lotus-eyed son—since this royal
  fortune of the Ikṣvāku line shall take refuge in you, my child.”
'42': >-
  Thus spoken to by his mother, Rāma then addressed his brother; looking at him
  as he sat with folded hands, humble, as though smiling:
'43': >-
  “Lakṣmaṇa, together with me govern this earth. You are my second self, my
  inner soul; this royal fortune has come to us with you at my side.”
'44': >-
  “O son of Sumitrā, enjoy the pleasures you desire and the fruits of the
  kingdom. Both life and kingdom do I wish for, for your sake.”
'45': >-
  Having thus spoken to Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma bowed to his mothers, and, having taken
  leave of Sītā as well, went to his own residence.
'46': >-
  Thus ends the fourth sarga, named “The Acceptance of a Mother’s Blessing,” in
  the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
