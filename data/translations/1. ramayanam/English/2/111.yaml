  Now begins the one-hundred-and-eleventh sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the
  illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, named “Bharata’s Admonition/Instruction.”
'1': >-
  Then Vasiṣṭha, the royal family-priest, having spoken to Rāma, once again
  uttered to him other words, righteous and in full accordance with dharma.
'2': >-
  For a man who is born into this world, there are three gurus: the teacher
  (ācārya), the father, and the mother, O Kakutstha, O Rāghava.
'3': >-
  The father indeed begets this man, O best of men; but the teacher bestows
  wisdom—therefore he is called the guru.
'4': >-
  Thus I am both your father’s ācārya and your own, O scorcher of foes. By doing
  my bidding, you will not transgress the path and course of the righteous.
'5': >-
  Here are your councils and assemblies, and likewise the guilds and the
  twice-born. Moving among these, dear child, and practicing dharma, you will
  not overstep the way of the good.
'6': >-
  It is not proper to act contrary to the word of your aged mother, devoted to
  dharma. Obeying her command, you will not transgress the course of the
  righteous.
'7': >-
  And obeying the words of Bharata, who entreats you, O Rāghava—O you whose
  valor rests upon truth and dharma—do not overstep what is right; do not act
  against your own true self.
'8': >-
  Thus sweetly addressed by his guru, Rāghava himself—the bull among men—replied
  to Vasiṣṭha, who sat there.
'9': >-
  Whatever conduct a mother and father ever show toward their son—what is done
  by mother and father is not easy to repay in return.
'10': >-
  By giving according to one’s power, by bathing and anointing, by speaking
  pleasing words always, and likewise by rearing and nurturing—
'11': >-
  That king Daśaratha is my sire, my begetter. What I have understood to be his
  command—of that there will be no falsehood.
'12': >-
  When Rāma had spoken thus, Bharata, most high-minded yet exceedingly
  distressed at heart, immediately said to the charioteer.
'13': >-
  “Quickly spread kuśa-grass here for me upon the bare ground, O charioteer. I
  shall sit in fasting at the feet of my noble brother until he is gracious to
  me.”
'14': >-
  “Without food, without regard for anything, and without wealth—like a
  brāhmaṇa— I shall lie down in front of the hut until he turns back (with me).”
'15': >-
  Then he—downcast—seeing Sumantra looking toward Rāma, had a seat of kuśa-grass
  prepared and himself spread it upon the ground.
'16': >-
  To him the mighty, radiant Rāma—the foremost of royal seers—said: “What is
  this, Bharata, my dear one? Why do you sit in fast-unto-death (pratyupaveśana)
  because of me?”
'17': >-
  A brāhmaṇa may rightly restrain men by taking to such a vow; but for those who
  have been consecrated with royal anointing, this rite of pratyupaveśana is not
  prescribed.
'18': >-
  “Rise, O tiger among men; abandon this dreadful vow. Quickly go from here to
  Ayodhyā, the foremost of cities, O Rāghava (Bharata).”
'19': >-
  But Bharata remained seated; and looking all around at the citizens and the
  countryfolk, he said: “Why do you not instruct and restrain the noble one?”
'20': >-
  Then the citizens and the inhabitants of the realm spoke to that great-souled
  one: “We recognize the descendant of Kakutstha; Rāghava speaks rightly.”
'21': >-
  “For this illustrious one too abides by his father’s word. Therefore we are
  not able to turn him back with ease.”
'22': >-
  Knowing their statement, Rāma spoke these words: “Thus understand the counsel
  of friends who behold dharma with clear eyes.”
'23': >-
  “Having heard both sides of this, and seeing rightly, O Rāghava (Bharata),
  rise up, O mighty-armed one; and touch me, and then touch water (to mark your
  resolve).”
'24': >-
  Then Bharata rose, touched water, and spoke these words: “Let the councils
  hear me—ministers and guilds as well.”
'25': >-
  “I do not ask my father for the kingdom; I do not command my mother; and I do
  not grant leave to the noble Rāghava—supremely knowing dharma (to remain
  away).”
'26': >-
  “If it is truly necessary that the forest-dwelling be undertaken and my
  father’s word be fulfilled, then I myself will dwell in the forest for
  fourteen years.”
'27': >-
  Rāma, righteous-souled—astonished at his brother’s truthful words—looked upon
  the citizens and countryfolk and spoke.
'28': >-
  “That which was sold, pledged, and purchased by my father while he was
  alive—neither I nor Bharata can annul it.”
'29': >-
  “No disgraceful evasion is to be practiced by me regarding the
  forest-dwelling. What Kaikeyī said was proper, and what my father did was a
  deed well done.”
'30': >-
  “I know Bharata to be forbearing and one who honors elders and gurus. In that
  great-souled one, steadfast in truth, all here is auspicious indeed.”
'31': >-
  “With this brother, devoted to dharma, when I return again from the forest, I
  shall become, together with him, the foremost lord of the earth.”
'32': >-
  “My father, the lord of the land, was constrained by Kaikeyī; I have fulfilled
  that word. By this, I shall free that king—my father—from untruth (from the
  charge of falsehood).”
'33': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-eleventh sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa in the
  venerable, illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, named “Bharata’s
  Admonition/Instruction.”
