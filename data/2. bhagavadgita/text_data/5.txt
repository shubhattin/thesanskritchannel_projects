॥ ॐ श्री परमात्मने नमः ॥
AUM shrI paramAtmane namaH

I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness

॥ अथ श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता ॥
atha shrImadbhagavadgItA

And Now, We start the Holy Bhagavadgita

अथ पञ्चमोऽध्यायः ।   संन्यासयोगः
atha panchamoadhyAyaH    sannyAsaYogaH

Thus starts the fifth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, called sannyAsa yogaH.

अर्जुन उवाच ।
arjuna uvAcha 

After listening to Lord Krishna's explanation on various kinds of action in the last chapter, Arjuna still has some doubts, which he expresses thus:

संन्यासं कर्मणां कृष्ण पुनर्योगं च शंससि ।
यच्छ्रेय एतयोरेकं तन्मे ब्रूहि सुनिश्चितम् ॥ ५-१॥
sannyAsaM karmaNAn kRShNa punarYogaan cha shansasi 
yachChreya etayorekaM tanme brUhi sunishchitam  5.1

O Krishna, you have praised the benefits of performing activity as a yajna, by being established in the state of yoga.
You also said that it is best to stay without the need for any kind of activity.
Which of these two lead to my well-being. Please tell me that one certain option.

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
shrIbhagavAnuvAcha 

Lord Krishna replied thus:

संन्यासः कर्मयोगश्च निःश्रेयसकरावुभौ ।
तयोस्तु कर्मसंन्यासात्कर्मयोगो विशिष्यते ॥ ५-२॥
sannyAsaH karmaYogaashcha niHshreyasakarAvubhau 
tayostu karmasannyAsAtkarmaYogao vishiShyate  5.2

Both sannyAsa and karma-yoga lead to the well-being of the self.
Among these two, performing activity equanimoulsy is a better option to giving up the need for activity.

ज्ञेयः स नित्यसंन्यासी यो न द्वेष्टि न काङ्क्षति ।
निर्द्वन्द्वो हि महाबाहो सुखं बन्धात्प्रमुच्यते ॥ ५-३॥
jneyaH sa nityasannyAsI yo na dveShTi na kAnkShati 
nirdvandvo hi mahAbAho sukhaM bandhAtpramuchyate  5.3

Know that one who performs all activity without attraction or aversion, is eternally liberated from activity.
One who is beyond these dualities is easily liberated from entanglement.

साङ्ख्ययोगौ पृथग्बालाः प्रवदन्ति न पण्डिताः ।
एकमप्यास्थितः सम्यगुभयोर्विन्दते फलम् ॥ ५-४॥
sAnkhyaYogaau pRthagbAlAH pravadanti na paNDitAH 
ekamapyAsthitaH samyagubhayorvindate phalam  5.4

Only the immature speak of true knowledge and eqanimous action as two different things.
One who is truly established in either of these achieves the results of both.

यत्साङ्ख्यैः प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते ।
एकं साङ्ख्यं च योगं च यः पश्यति स पश्यति ॥ ५-५॥
yatsAnkhyaiH prApyate sthAnaM tadYogaairapi gamyate 
ekaM sAnkhyan cha Yogaan cha yaH pashyati sa pashyati  5.5

That supreme state that is attained by true knowledge is also attained by equanimous action.
The one who sees true knowledge and eqanimous action as one, sees clearly.

संन्यासस्तु महाबाहो दुःखमाप्तुमयोगतः ।
योगयुक्तो मुनिर्ब्रह्म नचिरेणाधिगच्छति ॥ ५-६॥
sannyAsastu mahAbAho duHkhamAptumaYogaataH 
Yogaayukto munirbrahma nachireNAdhigachChati  5.6

It is very difficult to give up the need for activity without first learning to perform activity with equanimity.
The one who is established in eqanimous activity attains to the supreme state in no time.

योगयुक्तो विशुद्धात्मा विजितात्मा जितेन्द्रियः ।
सर्वभूतात्मभूतात्मा कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते ॥ ५-७॥
Yogaayukto vishuddhAtmA vijitAtmA jitendriyaH 
sarvabhUtAtmabhUtAtmA kurvannapi na lipyate  5.7

The one who has mastered control over the senses,control over one's own self, who is eqanimous, and sees one's own self in all of creation;
Such a person remains un-entangled even while performing activity.

नैव किञ्चित्करोमीति युक्तो मन्येत तत्त्ववित् ।
पश्यञ्श‍ृण्वन्स्पृशञ्जिघ्रन्नश्नन्गच्छन्स्वपञ्श्वसन् ॥ ५-८॥
naiva kinchitkaromIti yukto manyeta tattvavit 
pashyanshRNvanspRshanjighrannashnangachChansvapanshvasan  5.8

The one who knows the true nature of the self, knows that it is not the self that is the "doer".
The nature of true self is beyond the activities of seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, moving, sleeping, breathing, 

प्रलपन्विसृजन्गृह्णन्नुन्मिषन्निमिषन्नपि ।
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेषु वर्तन्त इति धारयन् ॥ ५-९॥
pralapanvisRjangRhNannunmiShannimiShannapi 
indriyANIndriyArtheShu vartanta iti dhArayan  5.9

It is beyond the activities of speaking, letting go, and grasping, and even opening or closing the eyes. 
Ones with the true knowledge of the self see that the relevance of the sense organs is just limited to the objects of the senses.

ब्रह्मण्याधाय कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा करोति यः ।
लिप्यते न स पापेन पद्मपत्रमिवाम्भसा ॥ ५-१०॥
brahmaNyAdhAya karmANi sangan tyaktvA karoti yaH 
lipyate na sa pApena padmapatramivAmbhasA  5.10

The one who performs activity, by being firmly established in consciousness, without any entanglement;
Such a person is free from the bondage of activity like a water droplet on a lotus leaf.

कायेन मनसा बुद्ध्या केवलैरिन्द्रियैरपि ।
योगिनः कर्म कुर्वन्ति सङ्गं त्यक्त्वात्मशुद्धये ॥ ५-११॥
kAyena manasA budhdhyA kevalairindriyairapi 
YogainaH karma kurvanti sangan tyaktvAtmashuddhaye  5.11

True yogis are indulged in all kinds of activity, with their body, mind, intellect and even the sense organs.
The perform activity without entanglement, with their aim to realize pure consciousness. 

युक्तः कर्मफलं त्यक्त्वा शान्तिमाप्नोति नैष्ठिकीम् ।
अयुक्तः कामकारेण फले सक्तो निबध्यते ॥ ५-१२॥
yuktaH karmaphalaM tyaktvA shAntimApnoti naiShThikIm 
ayuktaH kAmakAreNa phale sakto nibadhyate  5.12

The wise perform activity by letting go of their desire for results, and attain to steady peace;
While the un-wise get entangled in suffering due to their desire for results to activity.

सर्वकर्माणि मनसा संन्यस्यास्ते सुखं वशी ।
नवद्वारे पुरे देही नैव कुर्वन्न कारयन् ॥ ५-१३॥
sarvakarmANi manasA sannyasyAste sukhaM vashI 
navadvAre pure dehI naiva kurvanna kArayan  5.13

The one who is in absolute control, let's go of one's entanglement with activity.
Such a person then resides in bliss, within this body of nine doorways, wihtout being the direct or indirect cause of any activity. 

न कर्तृत्वं न कर्माणि लोकस्य सृजति प्रभुः ।
न कर्मफलसंयोगं स्वभावस्तु प्रवर्तते ॥ ५-१४॥
na kartRtvan na karmANi lokasya sRjati prabhuH 
na karmaphalasanYogaaM svabhAvastu pravartate  5.14

The creator has not created the need to act action. Neither was activity created, nor the attachment to it's results.
All of this is an outpouring of  sva-bhAva, or one's limited identity of self.

नादत्ते कस्यचित्पापं न चैव सुकृतं विभुः ।
अज्ञानेनावृतं ज्ञानं तेन मुह्यन्ति जन्तवः ॥ ५-१५॥
nAdatte kasyachitpApaM na chaiva sukRtaM vibhuH 
ajnAnenAvRtaM jnAnaM tena muhyanti jantavaH  5.15

The creator is not involved in either sinful or virtuous deeds of any living being.
True knowledge is veiled by ignorance, and all bound beings are deluded because of this.

ज्ञानेन तु तदज्ञानं येषां नाशितमात्मनः ।
तेषामादित्यवज्ज्ञानं प्रकाशयति तत्परम् ॥ ५-१६॥
jnAnena tu tadajnAnaM yeShAn nAshitamAtmanaH 
teShAmAdityavajjnAnaM prakAshayati tatparam  5.16

But for those, in whom this ignorance of the self is destroyed by true knowledge;
that knowledge reveals everything and brings about clarity, similar to a sunrise.

तद्बुद्धयस्तदात्मानस्तन्निष्ठास्तत्परायणाः ।
गच्छन्त्यपुनरावृत्तिं ज्ञाननिर्धूतकल्मषाः ॥ ५-१७॥
tadhbuddhayastadAtmAnastanniShThAstatparAyaNAH 
gachChantyapunarAvRttin jnAnanirdhUtakalmaShAH  5.17

Those who are of such intellect, of such knowledge of the self, of such steadfastness, and such immersion within the true self;
They are cleansed of their ignorance, and are not bound by the cycles of life and death.

विद्याविनयसम्पन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि ।
शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः ॥ ५-१८॥
vidyAvinayasampanne brAhmaNe gavi hastini 
shuni chaiva shvapAke cha paNDitAH samadarshinaH  5.18

With the dawning of this true knowledge, which removes all false pretences;
Such people look upon everything ranging from an enlightened being, or a cow, or an elephant, or a dog, or a dog-eater, with the same perspective.

इहैव तैर्जितः सर्गो येषां साम्ये स्थितं मनः ।
निर्दोषं हि समं ब्रह्म तस्माद् ब्रह्मणि ते स्थिताः ॥ ५-१९॥
ihaiva tairjitaH sargo yeShAn sAmye sthitaM manaH 
nirdoShaM hi samaM brahma tasmAd brahmaNi te sthitAH  5.19

Those whose minds are established in equanimity,they conquer the cycles of birth and death in this very life. 
They possess the flawless qualities of the creator, and are therefore established in divinity themselves.

न प्रहृष्येत्प्रियं प्राप्य नोद्विजेत्प्राप्य चाप्रियम् ।
स्थिरबुद्धिरसम्मूढो ब्रह्मविद् ब्रह्मणि स्थितः ॥ ५-२०॥
na prahRShyetpriyaM prApya nodvijetprApya chApriyam 
sthirabuddhirasammUDho brahmavid brahmaNi sthitaH  5.20

Such a person who knows divinity, and is established in it, is no longer deluded, is of a steady intellect;
and doesn't get swayed by either pleasant or unpleasant results of action.

बाह्यस्पर्शेष्वसक्तात्मा विन्दत्यात्मनि यत्सुखम् ।
स ब्रह्मयोगयुक्तात्मा सुखमक्षयमश्नुते ॥ ५-२१॥
bAhyasparsheShvasaktAtmA vindatyAtmani yatsukham 
sa brahmaYogaayuktAtmA sukhamakShayamashnute  5.21

Those who are not attached to external objects of senses, that bring about pleasure,
who realize absolute pleasantness within their own self,
only such people united with divinity through Yoga, experience unending happiness.

ये हि संस्पर्शजा भोगा दुःखयोनय एव ते ।
आद्यन्तवन्तः कौन्तेय न तेषु रमते बुधः ॥ ५-२२॥
ye hi sansparshajA bhogA duHkhayonaya eva te 
AdyantavantaH kaunteya na teShu ramate budhaH  5.22

The pleasures that arise from contact with the sense objects, are only capable of bringing about unpleasantness.
This is because the objects of pleasures have a beginning and an end.
The truly wise do not indulge themselves in such fleeting pleasures.

शक्नोतीहैव यः सोढुं प्राक्शरीरविमोक्षणात् ।
कामक्रोधोद्भवं वेगं स युक्तः स सुखी नरः ॥ ५-२३॥
shaknotIhaiva yaH soDhuM prAksharIravimokShaNAt 
kAmakrodhodbhavaM vegaM sa yuktaH sa sukhI naraH  5.23

Such a person who is capable of withstanding the powerful impulses brought about by lust and anger,
who can win over one's urges before the body perishes, such a person experiences true bliss.

योऽन्तःसुखोऽन्तरारामस्तथान्तर्ज्योतिरेव यः ।
स योगी ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं ब्रह्मभूतोऽधिगच्छति ॥ ५-२४॥
yoantaHsukhoantarArAmastathAntarjyotireva yaH 
sa YogaI brahmanirvANaM brahmabhUtoadhigachChati  5.24

Such a person who is blissed out by the light of truth within one's own self,
Such a yogi attains to the divine by realizing that the true nature of the self, and the divine are not separate.

लभन्ते ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृषयः क्षीणकल्मषाः ।
छिन्नद्वैधा यतात्मानः सर्वभूतहिते रताः ॥ ५-२५॥
labhante brahmanirvANamRShayaH kShINakalmaShAH 
ChinnadvaidhA yatAtmAnaH sarvabhUtahite ratAH  5.25

Such sages, who are rid of their ignorance, attain to divine liberation.
They are rid of their confusion through a disciplined sense of self and through devotion to the well-being of all creatures.

कामक्रोधवियुक्तानां यतीनां यतचेतसाम् ।
अभितो ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं वर्तते विदितात्मनाम् ॥ ५-२६॥
kAmakrodhaviyuktAnAn yatInAn yatachetasAm 
abhito brahmanirvANaM vartate viditAtmanAm  5.26

For such sages who have realized the nature of the self, by getting rid of their lust and anger, through constant training of the mind,
liberation from material existence is both here and hereafter.

स्पर्शान्कृत्वा बहिर्बाह्यांश्चक्षुश्चैवान्तरे भ्रुवोः ।
प्राणापानौ समौ कृत्वा नासाभ्यन्तरचारिणौ ॥ ५-२७॥
sparshAnkRtvA bahirbAhyAnshchakShushchaivAntare bhruvoH 
prANApAnau samau kRtvA nAsAbhyantarachAriNau  5.27

This is attained, ty keeping the external sense organs out of the picture, by focusing one's sight within the eyebrows, and by balancing one's inhalation and exhalation.

यतेन्द्रियमनोबुद्धिर्मुनिर्मोक्षपरायणः ।
विगतेच्छाभयक्रोधो यः सदा मुक्त एव सः ॥ ५-२८॥
yatendriyamanobuddhirmunirmokShaparAyaNaH 
vigatechChAbhayakrodho yaH sadA mukta eva saH  5.28

Such a person who has trained his sense organs, mind and intellect;
who is immersed in the pursuit of truth,

भोक्तारं यज्ञतपसां सर्वलोकमहेश्वरम् ।
सुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति ॥ ५-२९॥
bhoktAraM yajnatapasAn sarvalokamaheshvaram 
suhRdaM sarvabhUtAnAn jnAtvA mAn shAntimRchChati  5.29

Such a person who realizes that "I" am the one who enjoys the fruits of all eqanimous action, or yajna,
that "I" am the lord that rules over all craetion,

And thus ends the fifth chapter, by the name of sannyAsa yogah.
This is taken from Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of Yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality, called as brahma vidya.
