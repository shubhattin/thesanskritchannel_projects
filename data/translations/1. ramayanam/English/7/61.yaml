  Now begins the sixty-first canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Petition for Protection from Lavaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by those ṛṣis, the scion of Kakutstha spoke these words: “What
  is it that must be done? Tell me, O sages—let your fear first be dispelled.”
'2': >-
  When the descendant of Kakutstha had spoken thus, the Bhārgava said these
  words: “Hear, O lord of men, the root-cause of the fears, and also the source
  of affliction to this region.”
'3': >-
  Formerly, in the Kṛta age, O king, there was a Daiteya of exceedingly great
  might. Loḷā was his mother’s name; her eldest son was the great asura named
  Madhu.
'4': >-
  He was devoted to Brahman (a supporter of the brāhmaṇas), a giver of refuge,
  and firmly established in wisdom; and among the most noble devas there arose
  for him an incomparable affection and goodwill.
'5': >-
  That Madhu, endowed with valor and steadfastly intent upon dharma, performed
  austerities for many thousands of years, in order to please Rudra.
'6': >-
  Rudra, being pleased with him, came to grant him a boon; and, out of great
  regard, Rudra bestowed upon him a wondrous boon.
'7': >-
  Drawing forth a trident from his own trident—of immense power and great
  splendor—the great-souled one, highly delighted, gave it to him and spoke
  these words:
'8': >-
  “By you an unequalled dharma, pleasing to me, has been practiced. United with
  supreme satisfaction, I grant you this excellent weapon.
'9': >-
  So long, O great asura, as you do not stand in opposition to the devas and the
  brāhmaṇas, so long shall this trident be yours; otherwise it will go to
  destruction.”
'10': >-
  “And whoever, free from fever and panic, would engage you in battle—the
  trident shall reduce him to ashes and then return again to your hand.”
'11': >-
  Thus having obtained a boon from Rudra, the great asura, once more bowing down
  before Mahādeva, spoke these words:
'12': >-
  “O Blessed Lord, may this unsurpassed trident belong continually to my
  lineage, O god—for you are indeed the sovereign of the devas.”
'13': >-
  To Madhu, who spoke thus, the god Śiva—lord of all beings, of great
  splendor—replied: “It shall not be thus.”
'14': >-
  “Let not your auspicious speech, born of my favor, become fruitless. Yet of
  your sons, one shall possess this trident.
'15': >-
  So long as this trident shall remain in your son’s hand, he who bears the
  trident shall be invulnerable to all beings.”
'16': >-
  Thus, having received from the god this great and wondrous boon, that foremost
  of asuras caused a splendid dwelling to be built.
'17': >-
  His beloved wife was the greatly fortunate Kumbhīnasī; she was the daughter of
  Viśvāvasu and was radiant, endowed with great splendor, like a blazing fire.
'18': >-
  From her was born a son of great valor, named Lavaṇa, fierce and dreadful.
  From childhood onward he was of wicked nature and practiced only sinful deeds.
'19': >-
  Seeing that son, unruly and ill-disciplined, Madhu—filled with anger—fell into
  grief, yet he spoke nothing to him at all.
'20': >-
  Then, abandoning this world, he entered the abode of Varuṇa; and, having
  entrusted the trident to Lavaṇa, he conveyed to him that boon.
'21': >-
  By the power of that trident, and by his own wickedness as well, he torments
  the three worlds—especially the ascetics.
'22': >-
  Such is the might of Lavaṇa, and such is that trident. Having heard this true
  measure of the matter, O Kakutstha, you indeed are our highest refuge.
'23': >-
  Many kings in former times, O hero, were asked by sages afflicted with fear to
  grant them safety; yet we know of no protector.
'24': >-
  But we, having heard that Rāvaṇa—together with his forces and conveyances—has
  been slain, know you, dear one, as the protector; there is no other lord of
  men on earth. Therefore we desire that those oppressed by fear of Lavaṇa be
  rescued.
'25': >-
  Thus, O Rāma, the cause of that fear has been made known to you, and how it
  has arisen. You are able to ward it off; fulfill this desire, O you whose
  valor is unfailing.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-first canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the foremost of poems, entitled “The Petition for Protection
  from Lavaṇa.”
