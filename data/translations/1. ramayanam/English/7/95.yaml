  Now begins the ninety-fifth canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Dispatching of Messengers to Vālmīki”.
'1': >-
  Thus for many days did Rāma, together with the sages, the kings, and the
  vānaras, listen to that supremely auspicious and excellent singing.
'2': >-
  And in that song, realizing that the two sons of Sītā were Kuśa and Lava,
  Rāma, in the midst of that assembly, spoke words—summoning messengers of
  reliable and untainted intelligence, with a mind resolved in his own
  discernment.
'3': >-
  “Go forth, and convey my command—speak it in full—unto the presence of the
  Blessed One (Vālmīki).”
'4': >-
  In the midst of the assembly Rāma spoke these words: “If her conduct is pure,
  and if indeed she is free from blemish, then let her here establish her
  purity, with the great sage’s consent.”
'5': >-
  “Having understood the sage’s intention and also what is in Sītā’s heart, and
  desiring to furnish a proof (of her purity), quickly report this on my
  behalf.”
'6': >-
  “Tomorrow at dawn, let Maithilī, Janaka’s daughter, take an oath in the midst
  of the assembly—both for my vindication and for the purpose of purification.”
'7': >-
  Hearing these exceedingly wondrous words of the Rāghava, the messengers set
  out at once upon the road to where that bull among sages was dwelling.
'8': >-
  They bowed down to that great-souled one, radiant and of immeasurable
  splendor, and they delivered Rāma’s words—gentle and sweet.
'9': >-
  Having heard what they spoke, and understanding also Rāma’s intention, the
  sage of very great energy then spoke these words.
'10': >-
  “So be it; welfare to you all—just as Rāghava says. Thus shall Sītā do; for to
  a woman her husband is verily her divinity.”
'11': >-
  Thus addressed by the sage, all the mighty royal envoys quickly returned to
  Rāghava and related the sage’s reply.
'12': >-
  Then the son of Kakutstha, delighted on hearing the great-souled sage’s words,
  addressed the ṛṣis assembled there, and the kings as well.
'13': >-
  “Let the venerable ones with their disciples, and the kings together with
  their retinues, behold Sītā’s oath—and whoever else desires to witness it.”
'14': >-
  On hearing that utterance of the great-souled Rāghava, a mighty acclamation of
  approval arose among all the foremost sages.
'15': >-
  And the great kings praised Rāghava, saying: “It is fitting, O best of men;
  such conduct is found in you alone upon the earth, and in none other.”
'16': >-
  Having thus reached a firm decision—‘it shall be tomorrow’—Rāghava, the
  crusher of foes, thereupon dismissed them all.
'17': >-
  Thus, having deliberated, that lion among kings—having indeed determined that
  the oath would take place on the morrow—dismissed all the sages and all the
  kings, that great-souled one, of vast and lofty majesty.
'18': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-fifth canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the First Poem, named “The Dispatching of
  Messengers to Vālmīki”.
