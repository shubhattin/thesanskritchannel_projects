  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, begins the sixty-third
  canto, called “The Banishment (or Dismissal) of Menakā.”
'1': >-
  When a full thousand years had been completed, and that great sage had
  finished his vow and bath, all the gods approached him, desiring to reap the
  fruit of his austerity (that is, to bring his penance to an end).
'2': >-
  Brahmā, of exceedingly great splendour, spoke these most pleasing words: “Thou
  art a Ṛṣi; welfare be unto thee, by thy auspicious deeds that are thine own
  hard-won earnings.”
'3': >-
  Having thus spoken to him, the lord of the gods returned again to heaven; but
  Viśvāmitra, of mighty energy, once more performed severe austerity.
'4': >-
  Then, after a long time had passed, Menakā, the foremost of the Apsarases, O
  best of men, began to prepare to bathe in the pools at Puṣkara.
'5': >-
  There Kuśika’s son, the great and radiant ascetic, beheld Menakā—matchless in
  beauty—like lightning amidst a rain-cloud.
'6': >-
  The sage, brought under the sway of Love, whose pride had risen, spoke thus to
  her: “O Apsaras, welcome to thee; dwell here in my hermitage.”
'7': >-
  “Show me favour—welfare be unto thee—for I am bewildered by Kāma.” Thus
  addressed, that fair-hipped one then made her dwelling there.
'8': >-
  For a great impediment to his austerity had come upon Viśvāmitra; and while
  she dwelt there, O Rāghava, five years and yet another five passed by (in that
  very way).
'9': >-
  In that fair hermitage of Viśvāmitra, the years went by in ease. Then, when
  that time had passed, the great sage Viśvāmitra—
'10': >-
  —as though overcome by shame, became wholly given to anxiety and grief. In the
  sage there arose a thought, filled with indignation, O delight of the
  Raghu-line:
'11': >-
  “All this is but the doing of the gods—this mighty theft of my austerity!
  Under the pretext of day and night, ten years have slipped away.”
'12': >-
  “Overpowered by desire and delusion, this obstacle has come upon me.” Sighing,
  that foremost of sages, afflicted with remorse, was in sorrow.
'13': >-
  Seeing the Apsaras trembling in fear, standing with joined palms, Kuśika’s son
  dismissed Menakā with gentle words.
'14': >-
  Thereafter, O Rāma, Viśvāmitra went to the northern mountain. Resolving firmly
  with unwavering intent, that highly renowned one, desiring victory (over the
  senses),—
'15': >-
  —reaching the bank of the Kauśikī, performed an austerity hard to be endured.
  As he pursued that dreadful penance, thousands of years passed.
'16': >-
  While he practised that terrible austerity on the northern mountain, O Rāma,
  fear arose among the gods. Gathering together, all the gods with the hosts of
  Ṛṣis—
'17': >-
  —came and made this request: “Let Kuśika’s son indeed obtain the title of
  ‘Mahārṣi’—this is fitting.” Hearing the words of the gods, the Grandsire of
  all the worlds (Brahmā)—
'18': >-
  —spoke sweetly to Viśvāmitra, rich in austerity: “O Mahārṣi, welcome, my
  child; by thy intense penance I am well pleased.”
'19': >-
  “Greatness and the foremost rank among Ṛṣis I bestow upon thee, O Kauśika.”
  Having heard Brahmā’s words, Viśvāmitra, abounding in austerity,—
'20': >-
  —with joined palms and bowing low, replied to the Grandsire: “The incomparable
  title of ‘Brahmarṣi’—won by one’s own auspicious deeds—
'21': >-
  —if, O Blessed Lord, thou sayest that it is mine, then I am one whose senses
  are conquered.” Thereupon Brahmā said to him: “Not yet art thou one who has
  conquered the senses.”
'22': >-
  “Strive on, O tiger among sages.” Having thus spoken, he went to heaven. When
  the gods had departed, the great sage Viśvāmitra—
'23': >-
  —with arms uplifted, without support, subsisting on air, practised austerity:
  in the heat, becoming one who performs the fivefold-fire penance; in the
  rains, taking refuge in the open sky;
'24': >-
  —in the cold season, lying in water, that treasure of austerity enduring
  nights and days. Thus, for a full thousand years, he undertook a dreadful
  penance.
'25': >-
  While that great sage Viśvāmitra was thus tormenting himself (with
  asceticism), a very great distress arose among the gods, and for Vāsava
  (Indra) as well.
'26': >-
  Then Śakra (Indra), together with all the hosts of Maruts, spoke to the
  Apsaras Rambhā words that were for his own advantage—and against the welfare
  of Kauśika.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-third canto, named “The Banishment (or Dismissal) of
  Menakā,” in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
