  Now begins the twelfth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “Kumbhakarṇa’s Counsel (Kumbhakarṇa-matiḥ).”
'1': >-
  Having surveyed that entire assembly, the conqueror in battle then stirred on
  Prahasta, the commander of the host.
'2': >-
  “O commander of the army, you should give instructions that the
  warriors—trained and proficient, of all four divisions—be appointed for the
  guarding of the city accordingly.”
'3': >-
  Thereupon Prahasta, disciplined in mind and desiring to carry out the king’s
  command, stationed the entire force—both outside and within the palace
  precincts.
'4': >-
  Then, having placed all the troops for the protection of the city, Prahasta
  sat down in front of the king and spoke.
'5': >-
  “O mighty one, the forces have been duly disposed both without and within.
  Without disquiet of mind, swiftly do what you have in mind.”
'6': >-
  Hearing the words of Prahasta, the king Rāvaṇa—seeking the welfare of his
  kingdom and desiring ease—spoke amid his friends.
'7': >-
  “In what is dear and what is not dear, in pleasure and in pain, in gain and in
  loss, in what is beneficial and what is harmful, and in the crises of dharma,
  kāma, and artha—you are fit to discern the proper course.”
'8': >-
  “All undertakings, in every way and at all times, set in motion by
  you—employing counsel and action—have never been fruitless for me.”
'9': >-
  “As Vāsava (Indra) is encompassed by the Moon, the planets and constellations,
  and by the Maruts, so, surrounded by you, may I attain sovereign prosperity in
  full measure.”
'10': >-
  “Indeed I am ever ready to support all of you; yet it was not for this purpose
  that I roused Kumbhakarṇa from sleep.”
'11': >-
  “For this mighty Kumbhakarṇa, foremost among all bearers of weapons, has slept
  for six months; and now he has arisen.”
'12': >-
  “And this beloved chief queen of Rāma, from the forest of Daṇḍaka, was brought
  here—the daughter of Janaka—from a region infested and roamed by rākṣasas.”
'13': >-
  “That languid-moving woman does not wish to ascend my bed; and in the three
  worlds there is no other woman for me like Sītā.”
'14': >-
  “Slim-waisted, broad-hipped, her face like the autumn moon; gentle, with a
  golden radiance—as though she were Māyā fashioned by Maya himself.”
'15': >-
  “Her feet are smooth, their soles richly red, well-set and firm; seeing her
  copper-tinted nails, my passion blazes forth.”
'16': >-
  “Her splendor is like the flame of the sacrificial fire, like the radiance of
  the Sun; her nose is high, her face pure and lovely, her eyes beautiful.”
'17': >-
  “Beholding her, I became helpless, fallen under Kāma’s power; and with a
  countenance discolored by equal measures of wrath and rapture.”
'18': >-
  “Ever scorched by grief and tormented by desire, I have been defiled by
  longing; yet for the space of a full year that fair woman has not yielded to
  me.”
'19': >-
  “Awaiting her husband Rāma, that long-eyed lady—toward that charming-eyed one
  a fair promise was given by me.”
'20': >-
  “I am continually worn out by desire, like a horse on a journey; how will the
  forest-dwellers (the vānaras) cross the unagitated, unassailable ocean?”
'21': >-
  “That sea is crowded with many creatures and teeming fish; and those two sons
  of Daśaratha—indeed, even by a single monkey—great havoc has been wrought upon
  us.”
'22': >-
  “The courses of actions are hard to fathom; let each speak according to his
  understanding. We have no fear of mere men—yet still, let deliberation be
  made.”
'23': >-
  “Formerly, in the war of gods and asuras, together with you I won victory; and
  so too, with your aid, shall I conquer those monkeys headed by Sugrīva.”
'24': >-
  “Having reached the farther shore of the ocean, with the princes placed in the
  forefront, they have come upon the track of Sītā and have arrived at Varuṇa’s
  abode (the sea).”
'25': >-
  “Let counsel be taken by you: how Sītā is not to be given up, and how the sons
  of Daśaratha are to be slain; and let sound policy be declared.”
'26': >-
  “For I do not perceive in the world the power of any other—once the vānaras
  have crossed the sea, victory is surely mine.”
'27': >-
  Hearing the lamentation of him who was consumed by desire, Kumbhakarṇa grew
  wrathful and spoke these words.
'28': >-
  “But when Sītā was forcibly brought here, seized from Rāma together with
  Lakṣmaṇa—after looking into the matter even once and ascertaining it, your
  mind then should have turned away, as the Yamunā flows away from Yamuna (from
  its source).”
'29': >-
  “All this, O great king, has been done by you—unequalled. Yet the proper
  procedure for this undertaking should have been set in place at the very
  beginning, together with us.”
'30': >-
  “That king, O Daśānana, whose resolve is well-determined and who performs
  royal duties according to justice, does not afterward fall into torment.”
'31': >-
  “Deeds done without proper means, and deeds done in a perverse manner—while
  they are being done they go to ruin, like offerings in sacrifices performed by
  the unprepared.”
'32': >-
  “He who later wishes to do what ought to have been done first, and who first
  does what ought to be done later—he does not know right policy and wrong
  policy.”
'33': >-
  “In the affairs of the fickle-minded, even after a great strength has been
  duly weighed, others find a flaw and enter in—like birds entering the sky
  through the opening of a krauñca.”
'34': >-
  “This great enterprise was begun by you without due reflection; by good
  fortune Rāma did not slay you, as one would strike down flesh mixed with
  poison.”
'35': >-
  “Therefore, this deed begun by you—unmatched by others— I shall set right, O
  sinless one, by slaying your enemies.”
'36': >-
  “I shall utterly destroy your foes, O night-ranging one—whether they be Indra
  and the Sun, or Fire and Wind; even Kubera and Varuṇa I will fight.”
'37': >-
  “Even Purandara (Indra) would fear him whose body is like a mountain, who
  fights with a great iron club, who roars, and whose fangs are sharp.”
'38': >-
  “‘Again, with a second arrow he will strike me down’—after that, I shall drink
  his blood to my heart’s content; be assured.”
'39': >-
  “By the slaying of the son of Daśaratha I shall strive to bring you a victory
  that yields delight; and having slain Rāma together with Lakṣmaṇa, I shall
  devour all the leaders of the monkey-hosts.”
'40': >-
  “Take your pleasure, drink choice Vāruṇī, and carry out the tasks that are
  wholesome, free from feverish anxiety; for when by me Rāma has been sent to
  Yama’s abode, Sītā will, for a long time, be under your sway.”
'41': >-
  Thus ends the twelfth canto, named “Kumbhakarṇa’s Counsel,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the illustrious Ādikāvya.
