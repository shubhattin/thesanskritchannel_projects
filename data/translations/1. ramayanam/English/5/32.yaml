  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  thirty-second chapter, entitled “Sītā’s Deliberation (Sītā-vitarka).”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, seeing him concealed amid another cluster of branches, her mind
  becoming disturbed, she beheld him—his body wrapped about with an
  Arjuna-tree’s bark-cloth, tawny like a mass of lightning.
'2': >-
  There she saw the monkey—humble and gentle in bearing, one who spoke pleasing
  words—appearing like a heap of blossoming aśoka-flowers, with eyes like heated
  gold.
'3': >-
  And seeing that foremost of monkeys standing there with a disciplined,
  reverent demeanor, Maithilī was seized by the utmost wonder and began to
  ponder.
'4': >-
  “Alas! Terrible is this creaturehood—this hard-to-approach might of a monkey!”
  Thinking, “This is dreadful to behold,” she once again fell into bewilderment.
'5': >-
  Sītā lamented exceedingly, piteously, overcome by fear and delusion; afflicted
  with grief, the fair lady cried, “Rāma, Rāma!” and also, “Lakṣmaṇa!”
'6': >-
  All at once Sītā wept, her voice very faint though she was virtuous. And
  again, seeing the excellent monkey approaching with humility, Maithilī
  reflected, “This is a dream,”—so thought the fair lady.
'7': >-
  As she looked on, she saw that prince of monkeys, with a broad and somewhat
  wrinkled face, having the appearance described before—Hanūmān, son of the
  Wind-god—most eminent, most precious, the foremost among the wise, of a tawny
  hue.
'8': >-
  Gazing upon him, Sītā became utterly distressed; she was as though life had
  departed from her. After a long while, regaining consciousness, the large-eyed
  lady reflected thus:
'9': >-
  “Today I have beheld a strange, distorted dream: a monkey in a tree—one
  forbidden by collections of śāstras. May auspiciousness attend Rāma together
  with Lakṣmaṇa, and likewise my father, King Janaka.”
'10': >-
  “Yet this is not a dream, for I have no sleep—tormented as I am by sorrow and
  suffering. And happiness is not mine, since I am separated from him whose face
  is like the full moon.”
'11': >-
  “Thinking ‘Rāma, Rāma’ unceasingly in my mind, and speaking of him with my
  speech alone, I now seem to behold and also to hear a discourse befitting him,
  a narrative whose meaning pertains to him.”
'12': >-
  “Indeed, today I am afflicted by longing for him (by the God of Love), all my
  being fixed upon him. Ever reflecting upon him alone, in the same manner I
  both see and hear (him).”
'13': >-
  “I think it may be a mere fancy of my heart; yet I also deliberate with my
  understanding. What is the reason?—for fancy has no form; but this one, with
  form clearly manifest, speaks to me.”
'14': >-
  “Salutations be to Bṛhaspati, lord of speech, and to the wielder of the
  thunderbolt (Indra), and also to the Self-born (Brahmā), and to Hutaśana
  (Agni). And whatever has been spoken before me by this forest-dweller—so let
  that be, and not otherwise.”
'15': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-second chapter, entitled “Sītā’s Deliberation
  (Sītā-vitarka),” in the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primeval epic.
