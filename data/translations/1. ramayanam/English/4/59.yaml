  Now begins, in the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the
  fifty-ninth sarga, called “The narration of Suparśva’s words.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words spoken by the king of vultures—words like the very taste
  of nectar—those bull-like leaders of the vānaras rejoiced.
'2': >-
  Then Jāmbavān, foremost among the vānaras, together with all the
  monkey-warriors, sprang up at once from the ground and spoke to the
  vulture-king.
'3': >-
  Where is Sītā, and by whom indeed was she seen? And who is it that carries off
  Maithilī? Do you, O sir, declare all of this—for you are the refuge and guide
  of us forest-dwellers.
'4': >-
  Who would fail to consider the prowess of the arrows of the son of Daśaratha,
  whose descent is swift as a thunderbolt—arrows released by Lakṣmaṇa himself?
'5': >-
  Thus, delighting them again—those vānaras who had been released from their
  despair and who were intent upon the tidings of Sītā—he, pleased, spoke these
  words.
'6': >-
  Hear now how I came to know of the carrying off of Vaidehī; and by whom it was
  told to me, and where that large-eyed lady was.
'7': >-
  I have long fallen upon this rugged mountain-fastness, vast and extending for
  many yojanas—an old one, my life-breath and valour wasted away.
'8': >-
  In that condition, my son—named Suparśva—best among the birds, supports me
  with food at the proper times.
'9': >-
  Gandharvas are keen in their desires, serpents are fierce in their wrath; and
  among beasts, fear is sharp—therefore hunger too is sharp for us.
'10': >-
  Once, when I was tormented by hunger and longing for food, my son came to me
  after sunset, on that day, bringing no flesh.
'11': >-
  Pressed by me through the withholding of food—though he was one who ever
  increased my joy—he, understanding the matter as it truly was, spoke these
  words.
'12': >-
  ‘Father, at the proper time, seeking flesh, I soared through the sky and, at
  the gateway of Mount Mahendra, took up a firm station, closing it off.
'13': >-
  There, turning my face downward, alone I remained, intending to block the path
  of thousands of creatures that move between the sea and the shore.
'14': >-
  There I saw a certain one, dark as a heap of split collyrium, going along
  carrying a woman whose splendour was like the rising sun.
'15': >-
  Having seen those two, I resolved to make them my food; and I requested of
  him—by gentle and conciliatory speech—that he yield the path.
'16': >-
  For on earth there is no striker against those who are approached with
  conciliation; even among the lowly some person refrains—how much more one like
  me!
'17': >-
  He went through the sky with blazing energy, as though contracting the heavens
  by his speed; and then, by beings that move in the air, I was approached and
  honoured.
'18': >-
  ‘By good fortune Sītā lives,’ the great sages said to me; ‘somehow he has gone
  away with his wife—may you be well, beyond doubt.’
'19': >-
  Thus addressed by those supremely splendid perfected ones, that king—Rāvaṇa,
  ruler of the rākṣasas—was made known to me.
'20': >-
  I beheld the wife of Daśaratha’s son—Janaka’s daughter, Rāma’s consort—bereft
  of ornaments and silken garments, overcome by the onrush of grief.
'21': >-
  With hair unbound, she was crying out the names of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa; and the
  best of speakers said, ‘Father, this is a calamity brought about by Time.’
'22': >-
  This entire matter Suparśva reported back to me; yet even upon hearing it, no
  thought of valour arose in me.
'23': >-
  How can a bird without wings undertake any deed at all? Yet whatever is
  possible for me to do—one who lives by the strength of speech and
  understanding—
'24': >-
  Hear it; there I shall declare what rests upon your heroism. With speech and
  counsel I shall indeed do what is dear to you all.
'25': >-
  For the task of the son of Daśaratha is, without doubt, my own task; but
  you—best in counsel, mighty, and high-souled—are the ones for it.
'26': >-
  Sent forth by the king of the monkeys, and hard to assail even for the gods,
  and with the arrows of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa appointed as your support—arrows
  winged like herons—
'27': >-
  You are sufficient for the protection and the subjugation of the three worlds.
  Though Daśagrīva is indeed endowed with fiery energy and strength, for you who
  are capable, nothing whatsoever is difficult.
'28': >-
  Therefore, enough of delay through the passage of time—let firm resolve be
  made. For the wise, like you, do not cling to hesitancy in actions.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-ninth sarga of the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The narration of Suparśva’s words.”
