  Now begins the Eighth Canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, named “Mantharā’s Instigation (Counsel).”
'1': >-
  But Mantharā, filled with jealousy, flung away that ornament and then spoke
  these words, overcome by anger and sorrow.
'2': >-
  “For what reason do you rejoice so, and that too at an unseasonable time, O
  foolish one? You do not understand that you stand in the very midst of an
  ocean of grief.”
'3': >-
  “O Queen, though I pain you in my heart, I do so because I am stricken with
  sorrow. When you ought to grieve, you are delighted—yet you are about to fall
  into a great calamity.”
'4': >-
  “I lament your misguided understanding; for what wise woman would ever rejoice
  at the prosperity of the son of a rival queen—prosperity that comes like death
  itself?”
'5': >-
  “From Bharata there is fear for Rāma, since the kingship is a common object of
  claim; pondering this, I am cast down—for fear indeed arises from one who is
  afraid.”
'6': >-
  “Lakṣmaṇa of mighty arms is wholly devoted to Rāma in every way; and Śatrughna
  too is devoted to Bharata, O lady, just as Lakṣmaṇa is to Rāma.”
'7': >-
  “Even in the succession that is near at hand, O fair one, the order of
  sovereignty has been set aside for Bharata alone, for those two younger
  brothers for the present.”
'8': >-
  “Thinking of your son, I tremble in fear of Rāma—of that learned prince,
  well-versed in kṣatriya conduct, prudent, and one who accomplishes what he
  undertakes.”
'9': >-
  “Blessed indeed is Kauśalyā, whose son is to be consecrated tomorrow, on the
  asterism Puṣya, by foremost twice-born brāhmaṇas, with the great dignity of
  Yuvarāja.”
'10': >-
  “Having attained the earth—content, secure in reputation, and with his enemies
  slain—you will stand before Kauśalyā with joined palms, like a maidservant,
  waiting upon her.”
'11': >-
  “And thus you, together with us, will become her attendant; and your own son
  too will go into service under Rāma.”
'12': >-
  “Surely the chief women of Rāma will be exultant; but your daughters-in-law
  will not be glad when Bharata is ruined.”
'13': >-
  Then Kaikeyī, seeing Mantharā speaking thus, though exceedingly pleased,
  praised the very virtues of Rāma.
'14': >-
  “Rāma, the eldest prince, knows what is right; he is virtuous,
  self-controlled, grateful, truthful, and pure. Therefore he indeed deserves
  the office of Yuvarāja.”
'15': >-
  “Long-lived, he will protect his brothers and servants as a father would. How
  is it, O hunchback, that you grieve on hearing of Rāma’s consecration?”
'16': >-
  “And Bharata too, surely, after more than a hundred years, will obtain the
  ancestral kingdom received from father and forefathers—Bharata, the best of
  men.”
'17': >-
  “When prosperity has arrived, you seem as though you were burning, O Mantharā;
  and when good fortune is at hand, why do you torment yourself thus?”
'18': >-
  “As Bharata is honored, so is Rāghava even more; and beyond Kauśalyā, he
  renders much service to me as well.”
'19': >-
  “If the kingdom belongs to Rāma, then it belongs to Bharata too; for Rāghava
  regards his brothers just as he regards his own self.”
'20': >-
  Hearing Kaikeyī’s words, Mantharā, deeply afflicted, drew a long, hot sigh and
  spoke to Kaikeyī thus:
'21': >-
  “Seeing disaster, yet through folly you do not understand yourself; you are
  sinking in the vast ocean of sorrow and calamity.”
'22': >-
  “Rāghava will become king—and the son of Rāghava after him; but Bharata, O
  Kaikeyī, will be mocked as one fallen from the royal line.”
'23': >-
  “For not all the sons of a king remain in sovereignty, O passionate lady; if
  all were to be installed, it would lead to a very great calamity in
  governance.”
'24': >-
  “Therefore, O Kaikeyī, rulers establish the instruments of kingship in the
  eldest alone, O faultless-limbed one, even though the others too possess
  merit.”
'25': >-
  “Your son will be utterly broken—like one without protection, deprived of
  enjoyments and cut off from the royal line, O affectionate lady.”
'26': >-
  “I have come for your sake, yet you do not comprehend me; in the rise of your
  co-wife, you ought to grant me what I ask to be given.”
'27': >-
  “Assuredly, once Rāma has obtained the kingdom free of all obstacles, he will
  send Bharata away—to another land, or even to another world.”
'28': >-
  “Bharata, while still a child, was not taken by you to your maternal family;
  and from close association, affection arises—even among inanimate things, as
  it were.”
'29': >-
  “Under Bharata’s influence Śatrughna too has come to be like him; for just as
  Lakṣmaṇa follows Rāma, so this one follows Bharata.”
'30': >-
  “It is heard that some tree, meant to be cut by forest-dwellers, has been
  freed from great danger by reeds that grew close around it.”
'31': >-
  “Indeed, Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) is the protector of Rāma, and Rāghava (Rāma)
  likewise of Lakṣmaṇa; their brotherhood is renowned in the worlds, like that
  of the Aśvins.”
'32': >-
  “Therefore Rāma will not do any harm at all to Lakṣmaṇa; but that Rāma would
  do harm to Bharata—of that there is no doubt.”
'33': >-
  “Therefore let Rāghava go to the forest from the royal palace itself; this is
  what pleases me, and it is exceedingly for your welfare too.”
'34': >-
  “Thus the welfare of your own kinsmen’s side will also come about—if Bharata,
  according to dharma, obtains the paternal kingdom.”
'35': >-
  “That child, accustomed to comfort, the very-born enemy of Rāma—how will he
  live under another’s control, when the prosperous are made destitute?”
'36': >-
  “As in a wilderness a lordly elephant beset by a lion, so is Bharata being
  overpowered by Rāma; you ought to save Bharata.”
'37': >-
  “Formerly, in your pride of good fortune, you drove away your rival—the mother
  of Rāma. How would she not pursue enmity against you?”
'38': >-
  “When Rāma obtains the earth, endowed with abundant jewels, oceans, and
  mountains, then you, together with Bharata, O lady, will go to misfortune and
  humiliation—utterly wretched.”
'39': >-
  “When indeed Rāma obtains the earth, Bharata will surely be destroyed.
  Therefore think well: secure the kingdom for your son, and also the means for
  causing this other one’s exile.”
'40': >-
  Thus ends the Eighth Canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic, entitled “Mantharā’s Instigation (Counsel).”
