  Now begins the fifty-seventh canto in the Bāla-kāṇḍa of the blessed Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Petition for Triśaṅku’s Sacrifice.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, with heart inflamed by distress, recalling the humiliation
  inflicted upon him, he heaved repeated sighs, and thus became firmly resolved
  in enmity toward that great-souled one.
'2': >-
  He went to the southern quarter, O Rāghava, together with the queen; and there
  Viśvāmitra, the great ascetic, performed exceedingly dreadful austerities in
  their utmost rigor.
'3': >-
  Living on fruits and roots, self-restrained and disciplined, he practised most
  severe tapas. Then sons were born to him—devoted to truth and righteousness.
'4': >-
  (They were) Haviṣpanda, Madhuṣpanda, and Dṛḍhanetra, a great chariot-warrior.
  And when a full thousand years had been completed, Brahmā, the Grandsire of
  the worlds, (appeared).
'5': >-
  He spoke sweet words to Viśvāmitra, the treasure-house of austerity: “By your
  tapas, O son of Kuśika, you have conquered the worlds attainable by royal
  sages.”
'6': >-
  “Indeed, by this austerity we recognize you as a Rājaṛṣi.” Having spoken thus,
  the mighty Lord departed together with the gods,
'7': >-
  to the heaven of the thirty-three and to Brahmā’s world—the supreme sovereign
  of the worlds. And Viśvāmitra too, hearing that, bowed his face somewhat
  downward in shame.
'8': >-
  Overwhelmed by great sorrow and filled with anger, he spoke thus: “I have
  performed immense austerity, yet they know me (only) as a Rājaṛṣi!
'9': >-
  All the gods with the hosts of seers (declare so); I deem there is no fruit in
  tapas.” Having thus determined in his mind, that great ascetic once again
'10': >-
  practised austerities—he whose nature was righteousness, O Kakutstha, whose
  spirit was steadfast. And at that very time there was a king, truthful and
  self-controlled,
'11': >-
  known as Triśaṅku, an augmenter of the Ikṣvāku line. In him there arose this
  intention, O Rāghava: “I shall perform a sacrifice.
'12': >-
  I shall go, with this very body of mine, to the supreme abode of the gods.”
  Summoning Vasiṣṭha, he related what he had thus resolved.
'13': >-
  But Vasiṣṭha, the great-souled one, told him, “It is impossible.” Rejected by
  Vasiṣṭha, he went to the southern quarter.
'14': >-
  Then, seeking the accomplishment of that undertaking, the king went to the
  sons of Vasiṣṭha—those long-austere ascetics—where indeed they were practising
  tapas.
'15': >-
  Triśaṅku, of great splendour, beheld a hundred of Vasiṣṭha’s sons, exceedingly
  radiant, engaged in austerities, steadfast in mind.
'16': >-
  Approaching all those great-souled sons of his guru, he paid them reverence
  one by one in due order, with his face somewhat lowered in modest shame.
'17': >-
  With hands joined in añjali, he addressed all those great ones: “I have come
  to you for refuge—having approached those who are worthy to grant refuge, I
  have sought refuge.
'18': >-
  Vasiṣṭha, the great-souled one, has rejected me—may good be to you. I desire
  to perform a great sacrifice; you ought to grant sanction for that.
'19': >-
  Having bowed to all the sons of the guru, I seek to propitiate you. With my
  head bent, I beseech these brāhmaṇas who are established in austerity:
'20': >-
  May you, intent and composed, officiate for me for the sake of my success—so
  that I indeed may attain the world of the gods, even with my body.
'21': >-
  Rejected by Vasiṣṭha, O treasures of austerity, I see no other course of
  attainment at all, apart from the sons of my guru.
'22': >-
  For the priest of all the Ikṣvākus is their highest refuge; and next to him,
  all of you are my very divinity.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-seventh canto in the Bāla-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Petition for Triśaṅku’s Sacrifice.”
