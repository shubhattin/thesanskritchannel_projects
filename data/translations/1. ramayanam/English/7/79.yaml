  Now begins, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the
  seventy-ninth sarga, named “The Establishment of Daṇḍa’s Kingdom.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that most wondrous utterance of Agastya, Rāghava (Rāma), out of
  reverence and also out of amazement, began once again to question him.
'2': >-
  “O Blessed One, how did that dreadful forest come to be the place where he
  practises austerities—he, Śveta, the king of Vidarbha—(and how did it become)
  a forest devoid of deer and birds?”
'3': >-
  “How did that forest, O king (of sages), become empty and bereft of men? He
  entered it in order to practise austerities—this I wish to hear in truth, in
  full detail.”
'4': >-
  Having heard Rāma’s words, filled with eager curiosity, that supremely radiant
  sage began to speak.
'5': >-
  “Formerly, O Rāma, in the Kṛta-yuga, Manu, the mighty lord who bore the rod of
  punishment (as ruler), reigned. His son was the great Ikṣvāku, a joy to his
  lineage.
'6': >-
  Having installed that foremost son in sovereignty over the earth—hard to
  conquer—Manu said to him: ‘Become the establisher of royal dynasties upon the
  earth.’
'7': >-
  ‘So be it,’—thus did the son promise his father, O Rāghava. Then Manu,
  exceedingly delighted, spoke again to his son.
'8': >-
  ‘I am pleased, O most generous one. Without doubt you shall be the
  establisher. Protect the subjects by means of punishment; yet do not inflict
  punishment without cause.
'9': >-
  The punishment that is imposed upon men who have committed offences—when it is
  released in accordance with rule and justice—leads the earthly king to heaven.
'10': >-
  Therefore, O mighty-armed one, my son, be vigilant regarding the rod of
  punishment; for righteousness shall become supreme in the world through your
  governance and conduct.’
'11': >-
  Thus, after instructing his son in many ways with a collected mind, Manu,
  rejoicing, departed to the Tri-diva, to the eternal world of Brahmā.
'12': >-
  When he had gone to the Tri-diva, Ikṣvāku—of immeasurable splendour—became
  intent on thought: ‘How shall I beget sons?’
'13': >-
  Thereafter, that righteous-souled son of Manu, by diverse rites and acts of
  many kinds, begot a hundred sons, like unto the sons of the gods.
'14': >-
  But the youngest of them all, dear one—O delight of the Raghu line—was
  foolish, untrained in knowledge, and did not serve or obey his elders.
'15': >-
  His father gave that dull-witted one the very name ‘Daṇḍa’ (Punishment),
  (thinking): ‘Surely the falling of the rod (of chastisement) shall come upon
  his own body.’
'16': >-
  And seeing a dreadful region, O Rāghava, for that son, the foe-subduing king
  granted him a realm between the Vindhya and the Śaivala mountains.
'17': >-
  There Daṇḍa became king, on a lovely mountain-slope; and, O Rāma, he founded
  an incomparable, unsurpassed city.
'18': >-
  And he gave that city the name ‘Madhumanta,’ O lord. And he chose Uśanas—of
  excellent vows—as his family priest.
'19': >-
  Thus, with Uśanas as his priest, the king governed that kingdom—filled with
  delighted people—like the bull among kings, the lord of the gods (Indra),
  (ruling) heaven.
'20': >-
  Then that king, the son of the lord of men (Ikṣvāku), together with Uśanas in
  those days, ruled a very great kingdom—high-souled—just as Śakra (Indra) in
  heaven rules in company with Uśanas.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-ninth sarga, named “The Establishment of Daṇḍa’s
  Kingdom,” in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
