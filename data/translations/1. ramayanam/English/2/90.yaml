  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninetieth canto, named “The Sojourn at Bharadvāja’s Hermitage.”
'1': >-
  Beholding Bharadvāja’s hermitage from a distance of a krośa, that bull among
  men halted, and having stationed the entire host, proceeded onward together
  with his ministers.
'2': >-
  That knower of dharma went forward on foot alone, having laid aside his
  weapons and military equipment, wearing linen garments, and placing his family
  priest at the head.
'3': >-
  Then Rāghava, on coming into the presence of Bharadvāja, after causing those
  ministers to remain stationed, went forward following behind the purohita.
'4': >-
  And as soon as Bharadvāja, the great ascetic, beheld Vasiṣṭha, he quickly rose
  from his seat, and said, “Disciples, bring the arghya (honor-water)!”
'5': 'The intent is: because of (his) association with Vasiṣṭha.'
'6': >-
  After giving to them both arghya and pādya (water for washing the feet), and
  thereafter fruits as well, the knower of dharma, in due order, asked after the
  welfare of the (royal) family.
'7': >-
  Concerning Ayodhyā—its army and treasury, its allies and also its
  ministers—though he knew what had occurred with Daśaratha, he did not utter
  the king’s name.
'8': >-
  Vasiṣṭha and Bharata then asked him about their freedom from
  sickness—regarding their bodies, their sacred fires, their trees, their
  disciples, and the deer and birds (around the hermitage).
'9': >-
  “So be it,” having thus assented, Bharadvāja the great ascetic spoke to
  Bharata, bound as he was by affection for the Rāghava.
'10': >-
  “What purpose is there in your coming here, while you are ruling the kingdom?
  Declare all this to me, for my mind does not become clear.”
'11': >-
  “Kausalyā gave birth to Yama’s slayer, the increaser of joy—he who, together
  with his brother and with his wife, has long since been exiled to the forest.”
'12': >-
  “He, the illustrious one, who was charged by his father—(that father)
  influenced by a woman’s appointment—that he should dwell in the forest here
  for, they say, fourteen years.”
'13': >-
  “Surely you do not wish to do sin against that sinless one, intending to
  enjoy, free of thorns, the kingdom—his (rightful) kingdom—and that of his
  younger brother as well?”
'14': >-
  Thus addressed, Bharata replied to Bharadvāja; his eyes were filled with tears
  from grief, and his voice faltered as he spoke.
'15': >-
  “I am ruined, if even the Blessed One thinks of me in this way. I do not
  suspect any fault in myself; do not instruct me in this manner.”
'16': >-
  “Nor was this desired by my mother—what she spoke in my absence. I was not
  pleased by this, and I did not accept that word.”
'17': >-
  “Rather, I have come to that tiger among men as a supplicant for his grace—to
  bring him back to Ayodhyā, and to bow down at his feet.”
'18': >-
  “Knowing me to be thus disposed, you ought to show me favor. Tell me, Blessed
  One: where is Rāma now, the lord of the earth?”
'19': >-
  Then the Blessed Bharadvāja, entreated by Vasiṣṭha and the other ṛtviks
  (sacrificial priests), spoke words of favor to Bharata.
'20': >-
  “This is fitting in you, O tiger among men, born in the line of the
  Rāghavas—reverent conduct toward elders, self-restraint, and the following of
  the virtuous.”
'21': >-
  “And I know this resolve that is in your heart; let there be firmness (in it).
  It is to strengthen you indeed that I questioned you thus, thereby increasing
  your fame.”
'22': >-
  “I know Rāma to be a knower of dharma, together with Sītā and with Lakṣmaṇa.
  That brother of yours dwells on Citrakūṭa, the great mountain.”
'23': >-
  “Tomorrow you shall go to that place; stay here today along with your
  ministers. Grant me this wish, O very wise one, skilled in discerning what is
  to be done.”
'24': >-
  Then Bharata—of noble vision—saying, “So be it,” spoke these words with a
  contented look; and there the prince, son of the lord of men, resolved then
  and there in that hermitage to pass the night.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the ninetieth canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the venerable, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya, named “The Sojourn at Bharadvāja’s
  Hermitage.”
