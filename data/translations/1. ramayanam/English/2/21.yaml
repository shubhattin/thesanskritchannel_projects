  Now begins the twenty-first canto in the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Admonition/Address of Lakṣmaṇa and Kausalyā.”
'1': >-
  As Kausalyā, the mother of Rāma, thus lamented, Lakṣmaṇa—distressed—spoke to
  her words suited to that moment.
'2': >-
  “This too, noble lady, does not please even me—that Rāghava should go to the
  forest, abandoning the splendor of sovereignty, having come under the sway of
  a woman’s word.”
'3': >-
  “A king—contrary in mind, aged, and assailed by the senses—what would he not
  say when pressed on and stirred by passion?”
'4': >-
  “I do not perceive in him any offence, nor any fault of such a kind, for which
  Rāghava should be banished from the kingdom for dwelling in the forest.”
'5': >-
  “I see no man in the world—nor even one who speaks from afar—who would declare
  his fault, even if he were a friend cast off and rejected.”
'6': >-
  “Beholding him—godlike, upright, self-restrained, and affectionate even toward
  his foes—who would abandon dharma and cast away such a son without cause?”
'7': >-
  “This utterance of the king is like that of one who has again fallen into
  childhood; what son, remembering the conduct befitting kings, could accept it
  in his heart?”
'8': >-
  “So long as no man understands the true purport of this affair, so long let
  the command remain within yourself—together with me.”
'9': >-
  “With me at your side, bow in hand, O Rāghava, while you are protected, who is
  able to do anything more—standing before us like Death himself?”
'10': >-
  “I will make this whole Ayodhyā devoid of men with my sharp arrows, O best of
  men, if this course displeasing to you is to stand.”
'11': >-
  “Whoever sides with Bharata—or whoever seeks his good in this— all those I
  will slay; for the gentle man is indeed trampled upon.”
'12': >-
  “If our father, urged on by Kaikeyī, is satisfied (with this wrong), having
  become as an enemy and detached from us—then let him be slain; yes, let him be
  slain.”
'13': >-
  “Even in the case of a teacher, if he is arrogant, not knowing what should and
  should not be done, and has taken to a wrong path—then discipline becomes the
  proper course.”
'14': >-
  “Rāma, best of men—relying on what strength, or for what reason, does he wish
  to grant Kaikeyī this that has come to pass against you?”
'15': >-
  “When you and I have made unsurpassed enmity (against this injustice), what
  power has anyone, O subduer of foes, to give royal fortune to Bharata?”
'16': >-
  “O goddess, I am in truth devoted with all my heart to my brother; by truth,
  and by my bow, and by the cherished gift you have given me—I swear to you.”
'17': >-
  “If Rāma is to enter a blazing fire or the wilderness, then, O goddess, know
  beforehand that I shall have entered there first.”
'18': >-
  “By my valor I shall take away your sorrow, as the risen sun dispels darkness.
  Let the queen behold my prowess—and let Rāghava himself behold it.”
'19': >-
  “I will slay the aged father, whose mind is attached to Kaikeyī—wretched,
  standing in childishness, censured for the weakness of old age.”
'20': >-
  Hearing these words of great-souled Lakṣmaṇa, Kausalyā—weeping and yearning
  amid grief—spoke to Rāma.
'21': >-
  “Son, you have heard what your brother Lakṣmaṇa has said. Do, thereafter, what
  is truly fitting here—if it pleases you.”
'22': >-
  “And having heard the unrighteous words spoken by my co-wife, you ought not to
  leave me—tormented by grief—and go away from here.”
'23': >-
  “You wish to practise dharma, being known as one who understands dharma, O
  most righteous one. Remaining here, attend upon me—practise the unsurpassed
  dharma.”
'24': >-
  “A son who attends upon his mother, dwelling in his own house with restraint,
  attains heaven, endowed with supreme austerity—so did Kāśyapa.”
'25': >-
  “Just as the king is worthy of honor to you with reverence, so indeed am I.
  Therefore I do not permit you: you must not go from here to the forest.”
'26': >-
  “Separated from you, I have no use for life, nor for happiness. With you, my
  welfare would even be to eat grass.”
'27': >-
  “If you go to the forest, abandoning me—hungry only for sorrow—then I shall
  here fast unto death, and I shall not be able to live.”
'28': >-
  “Then, son, you will incur a hell renowned in the world—like the ocean, lord
  of rivers, would (incur) the sin of brahmin-slaughter through adharma.”
'29': >-
  As Kausalyā, his mother, thus wailed—wretched—Rāma, righteous-souled, spoke to
  her words in accord with dharma.
'30': >-
  “I have no power to transgress my father’s word. I bow my head to appease you;
  I desire to go to the forest.”
'31': >-
  “Even by a sage—Kandu—dwelling in the forest, knowing dharma, his father’s
  word was carried out; and (in that course) a cow was slain.”
'32': >-
  “And in our lineage earlier, by the command of Sagara’s father, a very great
  slaughter occurred, as (his sons) dug up the earth and thereby reached the
  ocean.”
'33': >-
  “And by Rāma Jāmadagnya, his own mother Reṇukā was hewn down with an axe in
  the forest—because of his father’s word.”
'34': >-
  “By these and by many others, O goddess—men equal to the gods—this was done. I
  shall, without faintheartedness, carry out my father’s word, for my father’s
  good.”
'35': >-
  “Indeed, it is not by me alone that this command of a father is carried out;
  it has been done, O goddess, also by those whom I have recounted.”
'36': >-
  “I do not undertake for you a dharma that is new and contrary; this path
  intended by the ancients is being followed.”
'37': >-
  “Therefore this must be done by me upon the earth, and not otherwise; for no
  one is diminished by fulfilling a father’s word.”
'38': >-
  Having thus spoken to his mother, he again addressed Lakṣmaṇa—the best of
  those who know speech, the foremost of all archers—with words.
'39': >-
  “Lakṣmaṇa, I know your unsurpassed affection for me, and your valor, and your
  steadfast courage, and your splendor that is hard to withstand.”
'40': >-
  “Yet, not understanding the great, incomparable sorrow of my mother, O you of
  auspicious marks, nor my resolve grounded in truth and in tranquility…”
'41': >-
  “Dharma is supreme in the world; upon dharma truth is established. And this
  excellent word of my father is itself grounded in dharma.”
'42': >-
  “Having once pledged to a father—or to a mother—or to a brāhmaṇa—one who
  stands leaning on dharma, O hero, must not act in vain (must not make it
  empty).”
'43': >-
  “Thus I shall not be able to transgress the command again; for, O hero, I am
  impelled by Kaikeyī through my father’s word.”
'44': >-
  “Therefore abandon, noble one, this thought that rests on kṣatriya-impulse.
  Take refuge in dharma; do not be harsh—let my judgment be followed.”
'45': >-
  Having thus spoken out of affection to his brother, Lakṣmaṇa’s elder brother
  (Rāma) again addressed Kausalyā, with joined palms and head bowed.
'46': >-
  “Consent to me, O goddess, as I go from here to the forest. You are bound to
  me by my very life-breaths—offer blessings for my safe journey.”
'47': >-
  “When I have fulfilled my vow and returned from the forest, I shall come again
  to the city—like the royal sage Yayāti who, having once abandoned heaven in
  former times, returned again.”
'48': >-
  “Bear up your sorrow in your heart, mother; grieve not overmuch. Having
  fulfilled my father’s word, I shall return here from forest-dwelling.”
'49': >-
  “By you, by me, by Vaidehī, by Lakṣmaṇa, and by Sumitrā—one must stand by the
  father’s injunction; this is the eternal dharma.”
'50': >-
  “Mother, having gathered the preparations, and restraining the pain within
  your heart, let my resolve for forest-dwelling—righteous in nature—be
  followed.”
'51': >-
  Hearing that speech of his—most righteous, unagitated, and unshaken—the
  mother, like one regaining consciousness after death, looked upon Rāma and
  then spoke again.
'52': >-
  “Just as your father is your authority, so am I—your guru by my own dharma and
  by motherly goodwill. I do not permit you; you should not, my son, go, leaving
  me in extreme sorrow.”
'53': >-
  “What is life to me here without you? What is the world to me—what even is
  nectar to drink? Better for me is but a moment of your presence than the whole
  of the world of the living.”
'54': >-
  As though a mighty elephant were being driven away by men with firebrands and
  had entered darkness, Rāma, hearing his mother’s compassionate lamentation,
  blazed forth again in sorrow.
'55': >-
  He—established in dharma—addressed his mother, who was as if senseless, and
  Sumitrā’s son (Lakṣmaṇa) who was afflicted and burning with anguish, with a
  righteous speech, as he alone there was fit to speak.
'56': >-
  “For, Lakṣmaṇa, I have always known your devotion and your prowess. But
  without considering my intention, you, together with mother, distress me—do
  not (so) cause great sorrow.”
'57': >-
  “Dharma, artha, and kāma in the world of the living have been examined with
  regard to the rising of the fruits of dharma. Of these, all would, beyond
  doubt to me, be as a beloved wife—obedient, desired, and with her son.”
'58': >-
  “But wherever all these are not firmly set, one should commence that course
  from which dharma arises. For one who is devoted only to gain becomes hateful
  in the world, and surrender to desire is not praised either.”
'59': >-
  “A preceptor, a king, a father, an elder—whether from anger, from joy, or even
  from desire—if he were to command a deed while keeping dharma in view, who, of
  compassionate conduct, would not do it?”
'60': >-
  “Therefore I cannot fail to carry out this entire promise of my father,
  exactly as it is. For he is our sire, our guru in command, and the consort of
  the queen—he is our refuge and our dharma.”
'61': >-
  “While that righteous king yet lives—especially while he treads his own proper
  path—how could the queen come away from here with me, like some other woman
  bereft, as though a widow?”
'62': >-
  “Therefore, consent to me as I depart for the forest, and perform auspicious
  rites and blessings for our safe journey, O goddess—so that when it is
  completed I may return again, as indeed Yayāti returned again by truth.”
'63': >-
  “For I am not able to set aside great glory merely for the sake of a kingdom;
  and within no long time, O goddess, while life remains, I would choose this
  earth, free from adharma, rather than a kingdom (won) by unrighteousness.”
'64': >-
  Thus the bull among men, urging his mother with such words, being resolved by
  valor to go to Daṇḍaka, then firmly instructed his younger brother; and he
  made obeisance to his mother, bearing her in his heart, by circumambulating
  her.
'65': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-first canto, named “The Admonition/Address of Lakṣmaṇa
  and Kausalyā,” in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the sacred epic
  composed by the seer.
