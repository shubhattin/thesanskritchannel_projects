  Now begins the twenty-seventh canto, named “The Slaying of Sumāli,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then that ten-necked Rāvaṇa, the rākṣasa of great splendour, having leapt
  across Mount Kailāsa, reached the world of Indra.
'2': >-
  As that rākṣasa host advanced on every side, a sound arose and rolled through
  the city of the gods, like the roaring of the ocean when it is churned.
'3': >-
  But hearing that Rāvaṇa had arrived, Indra was shaken from his throne, and
  there he spoke to all those gods who had assembled.
'4': >-
  “Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras, Viśvas, Sādhyas, and the companies of Maruts—make
  yourselves ready for battle against the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa.”
'5': >-
  Thus addressed by Śakra, the gods—mighty in valour and equal to Śakra in
  battle—girded themselves, endowed with great strength of spirit and filled
  with faith in war.
'6': >-
  Yet Mahendra, wretched and fearful before Rāvaṇa, went near Viṣṇu and spoke
  these words.
'7': >-
  “O Viṣṇu, how shall I act? He is of tremendous might and prowess, and this
  powerful rākṣasa advances for battle.”
'8': >-
  “He is strong by the granting of a boon, and not truly for any other cause.
  Therefore, what was spoken by the Lotus-born (Brahmā), whose word is truth,
  must be borne as effective.”
'9': >-
  “As Namuci, Vṛtra, Bali, Naraka, and Śambara were burnt by me while supported
  by thy power—so do thou act now in the same manner.”
'10': >-
  “For there is no other refuge, no other supreme resort in the three worlds,
  moving and unmoving, apart from thee, O God of gods, O Madhusūdana.”
'11': >-
  “Thou indeed art Nārāyaṇa, the glorious, the lotus-navelled, the eternal. By
  thee these worlds were established—and Śakra, and I, the lord of the suras, as
  well.”
'12': >-
  “By thee has all this been created—the three worlds with all that moves and
  all that is still; and into thee alone, O Blessed One, all beings enter at the
  ending of an age.”
'13': >-
  “Therefore declare to me the truth of the matter, O God of gods, for myself.
  And wilt thou, O Lord, fight Rāvaṇa, aided by the discus?”
'14': >-
  Thus spoken to by Śakra, the Lord Nārāyaṇa replied: “No fear is to be
  entertained. Hear my words.”
'15': >-
  “This evil-souled one cannot, for the present, be conquered by gods and
  asuras, nor even slain when encountered; for by the boon he has become hard to
  overcome.”
'16': >-
  “Yet in every way he will perform great deeds, being fierce in strength—this
  rākṣasa, together with his sons. Such is seen to be his very nature.”
'17': >-
  “But as for what thou hast said to me—‘Fight!’—O lord of the gods, I shall not
  engage that rākṣasa Rāvaṇa in battle.”
'18': >-
  “For Viṣṇu does not turn back from a foe in war without slaying him; and today
  that end is difficult to obtain, since Rāvaṇa is guarded by his boon.”
'19': >-
  “Yet I promise thee, O Devendra, here in thy very presence, O wielder of the
  hundred sacrifices: I shall become the cause of that rākṣasa’s death.”
'20': >-
  “I alone shall slay Rāvaṇa, together with his leaders and vanguard. Having
  known the time to have arrived, I shall gladden the deities. This truth has
  been told to thee, O king of the gods, O lord of Śacī.”
'21': “Do thou fight, casting off fear, along with all, O mighty one.”
'22': >-
  “I shall go when I know the time has come.” Then the Rudras with the Ādityas,
  the Vasus, the Maruts, and the two Aśvins, fully armed, swiftly issued forth
  against the rākṣasas from the city.
'23': >-
  Meanwhile, at the waning of night, a roar was heard—of that army of Rāvaṇa,
  battling on every side.
'24': >-
  Those great heroes, arrayed for combat, looking upon one another, turned with
  delight straight toward the battle.
'25': >-
  Then a great commotion arose among the armies of the gods, on seeing that vast
  host, inexhaustible, at the head of the fight.
'26': >-
  Then there arose a battle between gods, dānavas, and rākṣasas—terrible,
  tumultuous, with a mighty uproar, and with weapons of many kinds uplifted and
  set to strike.
'27': >-
  At that time the valiant rākṣasas, dreadful to behold—those ministers of
  Rāvaṇa—advanced for battle.
'28': >-
  Mārīca and Prahasta; Mahāpārśva and Mahodara; Akampana; Nikumbha; and Śuka and
  Sāraṇa as well;
'29': >-
  Saṃhlāda and Dhūmaketu; Mahādaṃṣṭra; Ghaṭodara; Jambumālī; Mahāhrāda; and the
  rākṣasa Virūpākṣa;
'30': >-
  Suptaghna and Yajñakopa; Durmukha; Dūṣaṇa; Khara; Triśiras; Karavīrākṣa; and
  the rākṣasa Sūryaśatru;
'31': >-
  Mahākāya and Atikāya; Devāntaka and Narāntaka—surrounded by all these, the
  mighty-armed and mighty-heroic one stood forth.
'32': >-
  Sumāli, the grandsire of Rāvaṇa, entered into the army. Enraged, he shattered
  all the hosts of the gods with sharp weapons of many kinds, even as the wind
  scatters masses of clouds.
'33': >-
  That divine force, O Rāma, being struck down by the night-rangers, was driven
  from all directions, like deer driven by a lion.
'34': >-
  At this juncture, the heroic eighth among the Vasus, famed by the name
  Sāvitra, entered the field of battle.
'35': >-
  Likewise the two mighty Ādityas, Tvaṣṭā and Pūṣan, well-armed and fearless,
  entered then into the fight with their forces.
'36': >-
  Then there arose a battle of the suras with the rākṣasas—rākṣasas enraged,
  unturning in combat, famed for their prowess in wars.
'37': >-
  Then all those rākṣasas, stationed in battle, smote the gods with dreadful
  weapons of many kinds, in hundreds and in thousands.
'38': >-
  And the gods, with bright and stainless weapons, drove those dreadful
  rākṣasas, of great might and prowess, to the abode of Yama in the battle.
'39': >-
  In the midst of this, O Rāma, the rākṣasa named Sumāli, wrathful, advanced
  against that host with weapons of many kinds.
'40': >-
  Enraged, he shattered all the forces of the gods with sharp weapons of many
  kinds, as the wind shatters and scatters a rain-cloud.
'41': >-
  All the suras, being smitten by showers of mighty arrows and by exceedingly
  dreadful spears and lances, could not stand together in close array.
'42': >-
  Then, as the deities were being routed by Sumāli, the eighth of the
  Vasus—Sāvitra—stood forth, wrathful and firm.
'43': >-
  Surrounded by his own chariots and divisions, that great and radiant one
  checked in battle, by his valour, the night-ranger who was striking down all
  before him.
'44': >-
  Then between those two there took place a great battle, causing the hair to
  stand on end.
'45': >-
  Between Sumāli and that Vasu—both unturning in war—then Sumāli’s serpent-drawn
  chariot was in an instant struck down and felled by the great Vasu with mighty
  arrows.
'46': >-
  Having slain in battle that chariot, crowded with hundreds of arrows, Vasu
  took up a mace in his hand, intent on Sumāli’s destruction.
'47': >-
  Then, seizing that mace with blazing point, like the rod of Death, Sāvitra
  brought it down upon Sumāli’s head.
'48': >-
  That mace, falling upon him, looked like a meteor; hurled by Indra, roaring,
  it was like a great thunderbolt crashing upon a mountain.
'49': >-
  Then there was seen neither bone, nor head, nor flesh of him; struck by the
  mace, he was reduced to ashes as he lay slain on the field of battle.
'50': >-
  Seeing him slain in combat, those rākṣasas on every side fled together, crying
  out to one another; routed by Vasu, the rākṣasas did not stand their ground.
'51': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-seventh canto, named “The Slaying of Sumāli,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
