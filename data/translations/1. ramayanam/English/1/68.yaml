  Then, in the blessed Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, the sixty-eighth
  sarga, called “The Summoning of Daśaratha.”
'1': >-
  By Janaka’s command, those messengers—whose mounts were weary—having halted on
  the road for three nights, entered the city of Ayodhyā.
'2': >-
  Proceeding in accordance with the king’s order, they were admitted into the
  royal palace; and they beheld King Daśaratha—aged, and radiant like a god.
'3': >-
  All the messengers, with palms joined in reverence and their fear dispelled,
  spoke to the king with humble, well-tempered words, uttered in gentle
  syllables.
'4': >-
  “King Janaka of Mithilā, with his sacred fires and Agnihotra set before him as
  his foremost observance, again and again addresses [you] with speech that is
  sweet, affectionate, and suffused with warmth.”
'5': >-
  “Janaka, O great king, inquires of your welfare and your unailing
  prosperity—together with your preceptor and your household priest—and of you
  along with your whole retinue.”
'6': >-
  “Having inquired, without agitation, into your welfare, Vaideha, the lord of
  Mithilā, then, with the assent of Kauśika (Viśvāmitra), spoke this message to
  you:”
'7': >-
  “Formerly, my vow was well known: my daughter’s bride-price was valor. And
  kings, their pride wounded, having proved themselves without strength, were
  turned back in disgrace.”
'8': >-
  “Now this my daughter, O king—while Viśvāmitra stood foremost—has, as it
  happened, been won by your sons who arrived unexpectedly, O king.”
'9': >-
  “And that jewel among bows, that divine bow, was broken in the midst, by the
  great-souled Rāma, O mighty-armed one, in a vast assembly of people.”
'10': >-
  “Therefore, by me Sītā must be given to that great-souled one, as the bride
  won by valor. I desire to fulfill my vow; you ought to grant your consent to
  that.”
'11': >-
  “Together with your preceptor, O great king, and with your purohita set in the
  foremost place, come quickly—may good befall you. You ought to come and behold
  the two Rāghavas.”
'12': >-
  “O lord of kings, you ought to bring my pledge to completion; and you will
  obtain joy and satisfaction with regard to both your sons.”
'13': >-
  Thus did the lord of Videha speak these sweet words—having received
  Viśvāmitra’s permission and acting in accordance with the counsel of
  Śatānanda.
'14': >-
  Having heard that message of the messengers, the king, filled with supreme
  delight, addressed Vasiṣṭha and Vāmadeva and also his ministers, saying:
'15': >-
  “Protected by the son of Kuśika (Viśvāmitra), the increaser of Kauśalyā’s joy,
  he dwells in Videha together with Lakṣmaṇa, his brother.”
'16': >-
  “Kakutstha (Rāma), whose prowess has been witnessed by the great-souled
  Janaka, and Janaka desires to perform the bestowal of his daughter upon
  Rāghava.”
'17': >-
  “If this intention of the great-souled Janaka is agreeable to you, let us go
  to the city at once, lest there be any reversal brought about by time.”
'18': >-
  The ministers, along with all the great sages, said, “So be it.” And the king,
  greatly pleased, said to the ministers, “Let the journey be tomorrow.”
'19': >-
  And the ministers of the lord of men, having been most honorably entertained,
  spent the night—all of them joyful, endowed with every excellence.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-eighth sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Summoning of Daśaratha.”
