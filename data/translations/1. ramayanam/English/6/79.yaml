  Now begins the seventy-ninth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Slaying of Makarākṣa.”
'1': >-
  Seeing Makarākṣa come forth, those foremost of vānaras at once leapt up
  together and, all eager to fight, took their stand for battle.
'2': >-
  Then there arose a very great and hair-raising battle—between the
  night-rangers and the plavaṅgas—like that of the gods and the dānavas.
'3': >-
  With the crashing fall of trees and of spears, and with the blows of maces and
  iron clubs, then indeed the monkeys and the rākṣasas battered and ground one
  another down.
'4': >-
  With śaktis, swords, maces, lances, and tomaras, and with pattisas,
  bhindipālas, and showers of arrows on every side, the rākṣasas assailed them.
'5': >-
  And with nooses, hammers, staves, and other dreadful strokes as well, those
  night-walkers wrought slaughter among the lion-like monkeys.
'6': >-
  Harassed by torrents of arrows from the son of Khara, the vānaras too—every
  one of them—became panic-stricken in mind and fled, afflicted by fear.
'7': >-
  Seeing the forest-dwellers fleeing, all the rākṣasas, proud and imagining
  victory already won, roared aloud like lions.
'8': >-
  When the vānaras were thus running in all directions, Rāma checked those
  rākṣasas with a rain of arrows.
'9': >-
  Seeing the rākṣasas held back, Makarākṣa the night-ranger, seized by a fire of
  wrath, spoke these words:
'10': >-
  “Stand, Rāma! With me there shall be single combat. I shall take away your
  life with sharp arrows loosed from my bow.”
'11': >-
  “In the Daṇḍaka forest you once slew my father; remembering that deed of
  yours—while I stand here intent upon my own task—my fury increases.”
'12': >-
  “My limbs burn intensely, O evil-minded Rāghava, because I did not see you at
  that time in that great forest.”
'13': >-
  “By good fortune you have come here into my sight, O Rāma. You are the one I
  have longed for—like another beast desired by a hungry lion.”
'14': >-
  “Today, driven by the speed of my arrows, you shall go to the realm of Yama,
  the lord of the departed; and you shall dwell there together with those heroes
  whom you have slain.”
'15': >-
  “But what is the use of many words here? Hear my speech, O Rāma. Let all the
  worlds behold you and me upon the battlefield.”
'16': >-
  “Whether with weapons, or with a mace, or with the arms alone—whatever you
  have practiced, O Rāma—let the fight proceed in that very way in combat.”
'17': >-
  Hearing Makarākṣa’s words, Rāma, the son of Daśaratha, smiling,
  replied—answering him who kept pressing ever more boastful claims:
'18': >-
  “Why do you brag in vain, O rākṣasa? Many are your words that do not befit the
  truth. In battle one cannot conquer by mere strength of speech, without
  fighting.”
'19': >-
  “Fourteen thousand rākṣasas, and your father too—as well as Triśiras and
  Dūṣaṇa—were slain by me in the Daṇḍaka forest.”
'20': >-
  “Today, O sinner, vultures, jackals, and crows—sharp-beaked, sharp-clawed, and
  hooked like goads—shall feast upon your flesh as their food.”
'21': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāghava, mighty Makarākṣa in the midst of battle discharged
  torrents of arrows at Rāghava on the field.
'22': >-
  And Rāma, with a shower of arrows, cut those arrows to pieces in many ways;
  severed, their golden-feathered shafts fell to the earth by the thousand.
'23': >-
  Thereupon, meeting each other with force, that battle took place there—between
  the son of Khara, the rākṣasa, and the son of Daśaratha.
'24': >-
  Like the rumbling of clouds in the sky, like the twang of bowstrings, the
  sound of bows released was heard—each against the other—on that battlefield.
'25': >-
  Gods, dānavas, gandharvas, kiṃnaras, and mighty serpents—all stationed in the
  mid-air—desired to behold that wondrous combat.
'26': >-
  As each was pierced in the other’s limbs, their strength increased twofold;
  and, making requital for requital, those two fought on the battlefield.
'27': >-
  The rākṣasa in the fight cut down the volleys of arrows released by Rāma; and
  the shafts released by the rākṣasa, Rāma in turn severed into many pieces with
  his arrows.
'28': >-
  All the directions and intermediate quarters were spread over with torrents of
  arrows, and the earth too was covered on every side, so that it did not shine
  forth.
'29': >-
  Then the mighty-armed Rāghava, enraged, cut his bow in the battle; and with
  eight nārācas he pierced the charioteer.
'30': >-
  Having shattered the chariot with arrows, Rāma slew and felled the horses; and
  that night-ranger Makarākṣa, deprived of his chariot, stood upon the ground.
'31': >-
  Seeing himself thus on the earth, the rākṣasa seized a spear in his
  hand—terrifying to all beings, and resplendent like the fire at the end of an
  age.
'32': >-
  That huge spear was hard to withstand—Rudra’s gift, dreadful—blazing in the
  sky like another weapon of destruction.
'33': >-
  Beholding it, all the deities, afflicted with fear, fled to the quarters;
  while the night-ranger, whirling that great blazing spear,
'34': >-
  in wrath sent it forth toward Rāghava in that great battle. As it came rushing
  on—flaming—hurled from the hand of Khara’s son,
'35': >-
  Rāghava in the air cut the spear with four arrows. That spear, adorned with
  celestial gold, shattered into many pieces and fell to the earth like a mighty
  meteor, struck by Rāma’s arrows.
'36': >-
  Seeing that spear destroyed by Rāma of unfailing prowess, the beings in the
  heavens cried out, “Well done! Well done!”
'37': >-
  Seeing his spear slain, Makarākṣa the night-ranger raised his fist and said to
  Kakutstha, “Stand! Stand!”
'38': >-
  Seeing him rushing down, the delight of the Raghu line laughed; then Rāma
  fixed the Fire-weapon upon his bow.
'39': >-
  Struck down in that battle by Kakutstha with that weapon, the rākṣasa fell
  there with his heart rent asunder—and died.
'40': >-
  Seeing Makarākṣa fall, all those rākṣasas—tormented by fear of Rāma’s
  arrows—ran swiftly back toward Laṅkā.
'41': >-
  Then the delighted gods beheld that night-ranger—Khara’s son—slain by the
  arrow-impetus of the prince, the son of King Daśaratha, lying scattered like a
  mountain shattered and strewn about when struck by a thunderbolt.
'42': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-ninth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Slaying of Makarākṣa.”
