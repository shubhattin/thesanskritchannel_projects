  Now begins the twenty-eighth sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Recalling (to Sītā) of the Hardships of
  Forest-life.”
'1': >-
  Thus, while Sītā spoke—she who knew dharma and was ever devoted to
  dharma—Rāma, loving righteousness, did not form the resolve to take her with
  him to the forest, reflecting upon the many sufferings that dwell in the
  wilderness.
'2': >-
  Then, having soothed her—her eyes clouded and tainted with tears—the
  righteous-souled (Rāma), with the aim of turning her back from her resolve,
  spoke these words indeed:
'3': >-
  “Sītā, thou art born of a very noble lineage, and thou art ever steadfast in
  dharma. Here (in the palace and in the city), practice thou dharma in such a
  way that my heart may find peace and gladness.”
'4': >-
  “Sītā, O powerless (tender one), thou must do exactly as I shall tell thee.
  For there are many faults and perils for one who dwells in the forest—know
  them from me.”
'5': >-
  “Sītā, let this intention of dwelling in the forest be given up. For the
  wilderness is indeed called ‘forest’ because it is laden with many defects
  (and hardships).”
'6': >-
  “This speech of mine is spoken truly with a mind intent on thy welfare. I do
  not know the forest as a place of happiness; the forest is ever only
  suffering.”
'7': >-
  “The roars of lions—born of mountain streams and dwelling in mountain
  caves—are painful to hear; therefore the forest is suffering.”
'8': >-
  “And deer, sporting without fear in the empty wastes, maddened and
  unrestrained, on seeing thee come forward toward thee, O Sītā; therefore the
  forest is suffering.”
'9': >-
  “Rivers, too, with crocodiles, thick with mire and hard to cross—even for
  elephants in rut—make the forest ever more grievous.”
'10': >-
  “Paths overgrown with creepers and thorns, resounding with the cries of owls,
  waterless and exceedingly distressful—therefore the forest is suffering.”
'11': >-
  “One must sleep upon beds of leaves, oneself broken down upon the bare earth,
  in nights when one is wearied and worn with toil; therefore the forest is
  suffering.”
'12': >-
  “Both day and night, one of controlled soul must remain content with fruits
  that have fallen from trees, O Sītā; therefore the forest is suffering.”
'13': >-
  “Fasting, too, must be undertaken as though it were one’s very life, O
  Maithilī; and one must bear the burden of matted locks and wear garments of
  bark.”
'14': >-
  “The rites to the gods and to the Pitṛs must be performed in due form; and
  guests who arrive must be honored daily without fail.”
'15': >-
  “Thrice-daily ablutions must be performed, at the proper times, constantly,
  for those who live moving about under vows and restraints; therefore the
  forest is more grievous.”
'16': >-
  “Offerings, too, must be made with flowers gathered by one’s own hand, upon
  the altar according to the ṛṣi-ordained method; therefore the forest is
  suffering, O Sītā.”
'17': >-
  “With whatever is obtained one must be content therewith, O Maithilī; living
  on the scant fare of forest-dwellers—therefore the forest is suffering, O
  Sītā.”
'18': >-
  “Excessive wind, darkness, and hunger ever and again, and great terrors
  besides are found there; therefore the forest is still more grievous.”
'19': >-
  “Many creeping creatures, of many forms, roam the path with boldness, O fair
  one; therefore the forest is more grievous.”
'20': >-
  “Serpents whose abode is in rivers, that move along the river’s winding
  course, lie in wait, covering and blocking the way; therefore the forest is
  more grievous.”
'21': >-
  “Moths, scorpions, worms, gadflies, and mosquitoes together ever torment thee,
  O delicate one; therefore the forest is all suffering.”
'22': >-
  “Trees, too, thorny, and kuśa-grass and kāśa-grass, O fair one, with
  branch-tips that lash and confuse (the traveler) in the wood—therefore the
  forest is suffering.”
'23': >-
  “Many bodily hardships and terrors of diverse kinds befall one who dwells in
  the forest; the forest is ever only suffering.”
'24': >-
  “Anger and greed must be cast away; the mind must be set upon austerity; and
  one must not fear even where fear is present—therefore the forest is unceasing
  pain.”
'25': >-
  “Therefore it is enough for thee; go not to the forest—for the forest is not
  thy safety. As I consider it, I behold the forest as producing many evils.”
'26': >-
  When that great-souled Rāma had thus resolved not to take her to the forest,
  Sītā did not comply with that word of his; and then, deeply distressed, she
  spoke this to Rāma.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-eighth sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Recalling of the Hardships of
  Forest-life.”
