  Now begins the forty-second canto of the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Slaying of the Kiṅkaras.”
'1': >-
  Then, by the cries of birds and by the loud sound of breaking trees, all the
  inhabitants of Laṅkā became alarmed and agitated with fear.
'2': >-
  Terrified, the beasts and birds fled away, crying out; and among the rākṣasas,
  cruel and inauspicious omens manifested themselves.
'3': >-
  Then, as sleep departed, the rākṣasīs with hideous faces beheld that grove
  shattered and ruined, and they also saw that heroic great monkey.
'4': >-
  Seeing them, the mighty-armed one—of great spirit and great strength—assumed a
  very vast form, terrible to the rākṣasīs and striking fear into them.
'5': >-
  Then the rākṣasīs, seeing the monkey like a mountain in appearance, of
  enormous size and great power, questioned Janaka’s daughter.
'6': >-
  “Who is this? Whose is he, and whence has he come? For what purpose has he
  come here? And how is it that you have held conversation with him?”—so they
  asked.
'7': >-
  “Tell us, large-eyed one; let there be no fear for you, O fair one. O
  dark-lashed one, what conversation has this one had with you?”
'8': >-
  Then the virtuous Sītā, whose entire body was radiant with beauty, spoke:
  “What course is there for me in discerning those rākṣasas who assume forms at
  will?”
'9': >-
  “You yourselves know who he is and what he will do. For a serpent alone knows
  the movements of a serpent—of this there is no doubt.”
'10': >-
  “I too am exceedingly afraid; indeed I do not know who this is. I only
  understand that he has come in the guise of a rākṣasa, one who can change his
  form at will.”
'11': >-
  Hearing Vaidehī’s words, the rākṣasīs hurried away quickly; some remained
  standing there, and some went to report to Rāvaṇa.
'12': >-
  Approaching Rāvaṇa, the rākṣasīs of misshapen, hideous faces informed him of
  that dreadful, monstrous-looking monkey.
'13': >-
  “O King, in the midst of the Aśoka grove stands a monkey of terrible form, of
  immeasurable prowess, who has held discourse with Sītā.”
'14': >-
  “And Sītā Jānakī, doe-eyed, does not wish to tell us who that monkey is,
  though we have questioned her in many ways, desiring to report it.”
'15': >-
  “He may be a messenger of Vāsava (Indra), or a messenger of Vaiśravaṇa
  (Kubera), or else he may have been sent by Rāma with the desire to seek Sītā.”
'16': >-
  “By that marvellous form of his, the delightful pleasure-grove of yours—filled
  with herds of various deer—has been ravaged and laid waste.”
'17': >-
  “There is no spot there that has not been destroyed by him—except the very
  place where that goddess Jānakī is; that alone has not been ruined by him.”
'18': >-
  “Whether out of weariness, or for the sake of protecting Jānakī, it cannot be
  clearly determined; but indeed what weariness could there be for him? It is
  she alone that has been kept guarded by him.”
'19': >-
  “The śiṃśapā tree that had grown luxuriant—rich with lovely shoots and
  leaves—upon which Sītā herself was seated, that too has been protected by
  him.”
'20': >-
  “For that one of dreadful form, you ought to decree a dreadful punishment—he
  by whom Sītā was spoken to, and by whom the grove was destroyed.”
'21': >-
  “O lord of the rākṣasa hosts, she is held in your mind as your own; who would
  dare to address Sītā unless he had abandoned his life?”
'22': >-
  Hearing the rākṣasīs’ words, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, blazed up like the
  fire of a funeral pyre, his eyes inflamed and distorted by wrath.
'23': >-
  From the eyes of that enraged one, tears fell—like drops of oil dripping from
  two blazing lamps with their flames.
'24': >-
  That great-splendoured one then ordered certain heroic rākṣasas, called
  Kiṅkaras—equal to himself in nature—to seize Hanumān.
'25': >-
  Eighty thousand of those mighty Kiṅkaras went forth from that palace, bearing
  mallets and maces in their hands.
'26': >-
  Great-bellied, great-fanged, of dreadful form and great strength—all intent
  upon battle, all facing toward the capture of Hanumān—
'27': >-
  they rushed at that monkey who stood upon the gateway-arch, with great speed,
  like moths rushing into a fire.
'28': >-
  With diverse clubs, with iron bars, with golden armlets, and with arrows
  resembling the sun, they advanced upon the best of monkeys.
'29': >-
  Bearing mallets, hatchets, tridents, spears, and javelins in their hands, they
  surrounded Hanumān and suddenly stood confronting him.
'30': >-
  But Hanumān, brilliant and illustrious, resembling a mountain, struck his tail
  upon the ground and roared with a mighty sound.
'31': >-
  Then Hanumān, son of the Wind, becoming of gigantic body, lashed and whirled
  his tail, filling Laṅkā with its sound.
'32': >-
  By the loud cracking sound of his tail, and by that great reverberation, birds
  fell from the sky; and he cried aloud this:
'33': >-
  “Victory to the exceedingly powerful Rāma, and to Lakṣmaṇa of great strength!
  Victory to King Sugrīva, protected by Rāghava!”
'34': >-
  “I am the servant of the lord of Kosala—Rāma of untiring deeds. I am Hanumān,
  son of the Wind, the slayer of the armies of enemies!”
'35': >-
  “Not even a thousand Rāvaṇas would be a counterpoise to me in battle, while I
  strike with rocks and with trees by the thousand!”
'36': >-
  “Having harassed the city of Laṅkā, and having paid homage to Maithilī, I
  shall depart with my purpose fulfilled, even as all the rākṣasas look on!”
'37': >-
  By the sound of his thunderous roar, they became anxious with fear; and they
  beheld Hanumān towering aloft like a cloud at twilight.
'38': >-
  Then those rākṣasas, confident that they were acting under their lord’s
  command, rushed again and again upon the monkey with dreadful, varied weapons.
'39': >-
  Surrounded on all sides by those valiant warriors, that mighty one reached for
  a dreadful iron bar, taking his stand upon the gateway-arch.
'40': >-
  Taking up that iron bar, he struck the night-rangers—just as Garuḍa, son of
  Vinatā, would seize and smite a writhing serpent.
'41': >-
  Grasping that bar, the hero Māruti ranged through the air and slew them, as
  the thousand-eyed Indra with his thunderbolt slays the Dānavas.
'42': >-
  Having slain the Kiṅkaras, the heroic son of the Wind—still desiring battle,
  that great hero—stood again upon the gateway-arch.
'43': >-
  Then, freed from fear, some rākṣasas there went and reported to Rāvaṇa that
  all the Kiṅkaras had been slain.
'44': >-
  Hearing that the mighty force of rākṣasas had been slain, the king, his eyes
  rolling in fury, commanded the son of Prahasta—peerless in prowess and very
  hard to overcome in battle—to go forth.
'45': >-
  Thus ends the forty-second canto of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the sacred, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first among poets, entitled “The Slaying of
  the Kiṅkaras.”
