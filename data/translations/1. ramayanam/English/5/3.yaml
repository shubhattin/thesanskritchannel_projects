  Now begins the third canto in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundarakāṇḍa,
  entitled “The Conquest of the Presiding Deity of Laṅkā.”
'1': >-
  Then Hanumān, the wise son of the Wind-god, assuming steadfast courage, came
  upon that lofty peak—tall and stretching high, resembling a huge bank of
  rain-clouds.
'2': >-
  In the night, that great-souled, mighty monkey—chief among the Vānaras—entered
  Laṅkā, the city guarded by Rāvaṇa, rich in lovely groves and abundant waters.
'3': >-
  It was adorned with mansions resembling autumnal clouds, resounding like the
  ocean, and fanned by sea-breezes.
'4': >-
  Well-fortified and strengthened with great forces, like a mighty tree laden
  with branches; furnished with beautiful arches and projecting gateways, with
  pale-white doorways and triumphal portals.
'5': >-
  Protected like Bhogavatī—the serpent-city—moving with the stealth of serpents;
  and filled with lightning amid dense clouds, frequented by hosts of luminous
  beings.
'6': >-
  Roaring with the tumult of fierce winds, and like Amarāvatī itself;
  encompassed by a vast rampart of great gold.
'7': >-
  Adorned with the clatter of netted rows of bells and with fluttering
  banners—having reached it, Hanumān, delighted, at once approached the rampart.
'8': >-
  His heart seized with wonder, he beheld the city on every side—its gateways
  made of Jāmbūnada-gold, its platforms fashioned of vaidūrya (cat’s-eye gem).
'9': >-
  Its gem-inlaid pavements were embellished with vajra (diamond), crystal, and
  pearls; its projecting terraces were of heated gold, and its pale whiteness
  was like silver and polished ivory.
'10': >-
  It had stairways wrought of vaidūrya, with inner courts dusted with
  crystal-like sand; auspicious and lovely, seeming as though sprung up into the
  sky.
'11': >-
  Resounding with the cries of krauñca birds and peacocks, frequented by royal
  swans, and echoing everywhere with the din of musical instruments and
  ornaments.
'12': >-
  Beholding that city, like the abode of the Vasus, Laṅkā that seemed to have
  risen into the heavens, Hanumān the monkey rejoiced.
'13': >-
  Gazing upon that auspicious Laṅkā, belonging to the lord of
  Rākṣasas—unsurpassed and filled with prosperity—the valiant one reflected.
'14': >-
  “Truly this city cannot be assailed by force by anyone else; it is guarded by
  Rāvaṇa’s troops, with weapons raised in their hands.”
'15': >-
  “Even for Kumuda and Aṅgada, and for the great monkey Suṣeṇa, and even for the
  famed Mainda and Dvivida, this ground would become renowned (as difficult to
  conquer).”
'16': >-
  “Even for the son of Vivasvān (the Sun), and for Kuśaparvan’s mighty
  monkey-chief, and even for me—this would be hard to traverse.”
'17': >-
  And, considering the prowess of the great-armed Rāghava (Rāma), and the valor
  of Lakṣmaṇa, the monkey became filled with joy.
'18': >-
  He saw it clad, as it were, in garments of jewels; like a woman adorned—its
  cow-stalls and houses serving as ornaments, its workshops and storehouses like
  full breasts, rich and flourishing.
'19': >-
  That city of the king of Rākṣasas—its darkness dispelled by bright lamps and
  by the great luminaries—was beheld by the great monkey.
'20': >-
  Then the city itself beheld the tiger among monkeys, the great ape, the son of
  the Wind, as he was entering—revealed in her own embodied form.
'21': >-
  Seeing that foremost of monkeys, Laṅkā, guarded by Rāvaṇa, rose up of herself
  there, appearing with a dreadful, distorted countenance.
'22': >-
  Standing before that heroic son of the Wind, she released a mighty roar and
  spoke to Hanumān.
'23': >-
  “Who are you, and for what purpose have you come here, you dweller of the
  woods? Tell me here the truth of the matter, while your life-breath yet
  remains.”
'24': >-
  “Indeed, O Vānara, you are not able to enter this Laṅkā; it is guarded by
  Rāvaṇa’s forces and well-protected on all sides.”
'25': >-
  Then the hero Hanumān said to her, as she stood before him: “I shall tell you
  the truth of that which you ask me.”
'26': >-
  “Who are you, with misshapen eyes, standing at the city-gate? And why, in
  fierce anger, do you harshly rebuke me?”
'27': >-
  Hearing Hanumān’s words, Laṅkā—able to assume forms at will—angrily spoke
  harsh speech to the son of the Wind.
'28': >-
  “I am the formidable sentinel who awaits the command of the great-souled
  Rāvaṇa, king of the Rākṣasas; I guard this city.”
'29': >-
  “Disregarding me, you cannot enter this city. This very day, bereft of life by
  me, you shall lie slain.”
'30': >-
  “For I am Laṅkā itself, O Plavaṅgama; I guard it on every side. Therefore have
  I told you so.”
'31': >-
  Hearing Laṅkā’s words, Hanumān, the son of the Wind, that best of monkeys,
  stood striving and steadfast—like another mountain unmoving.
'32': >-
  Seeing her, a female form made hideous, the leader of Vānaras—wise and
  courageous, the bull among monkeys—then addressed her:
'33': >-
  “I wish to behold the city of Laṅkā with its ramparts, walls, and gateways;
  for this purpose have I come here. Great indeed is my curiosity.”
'34': >-
  “The forests and pleasure-groves here, and Laṅkā’s gardens, and all the
  foremost houses everywhere—indeed, I have come to see them.”
'35': >-
  Hearing his words, Laṅkā, the shape-shifter, once again spoke to him in harsh
  syllables.
'36': >-
  “Without conquering me, O fool—this city guarded by the lord of Rākṣasas
  cannot today be seen by you, O lowest of monkeys!”
'37': >-
  Then Hanumān, the tiger among monkeys, said to that night-roaming guardian:
  “Having seen this city, O fair one, I shall return as I came.”
'38': >-
  Then Laṅkā, terrible, uttering a great roar, swiftly struck the foremost of
  monkeys with the palm of her hand.
'39': >-
  Then the tiger among monkeys, struck hard by Laṅkā, let out a very mighty
  roar—Hanumān, the valiant son of the Wind.
'40': >-
  Then, folding the fingers of his left hand into a fist, Hanumān—fainting with
  wrath—smote her with his clenched fist.
'41': >-
  Thinking, “She is a woman,” he of himself did not give way to excessive anger;
  yet, struck by that blow, the night-prowling demoness, her limbs shaken, fell
  suddenly to the ground—her face distorted.
'42': >-
  Then the heroic Hanumān, seeing her thus cast down, showed compassion—the
  radiant one, deeming her to be a woman.
'43': >-
  Then Laṅkā, greatly distressed, in faltering words, spoke to Hanumān the
  Plavaṅgama—speech without pride.
'44': >-
  “Be gracious, O very mighty-armed one; protect me, O best of monkeys. At the
  proper time, the strong and valorous stand restrained and gentle.”
'45': >-
  “I am Laṅkā itself, O Plavaṅgama. Conquered am I by you, O hero—by your valor,
  O very powerful one.”
'46': >-
  “And hear from me this truth as I speak, O lord among monkeys—how a boon was
  granted to me by Svayambhū (the Self-born Brahmā) himself.”
'47': >-
  “When some Vānara, by prowess, should bring you under his power, then by that
  you must know that fear has come upon the Rākṣasas.”
'48': >-
  “That appointed time, O gentle one, has today arrived through the sight of
  you. What is ordained by Svayambhū is true; there is no transgressing it.”
'49': >-
  “On account of Sītā, destruction has come near for the wicked king Rāvaṇa, and
  for all the Rākṣasas as well.”
'50': >-
  “Therefore enter, O best of monkeys, the city guarded by Rāvaṇa, and
  accomplish all the tasks here—whatever you wish to do.”
'51': >-
  Entering this auspicious city—struck by a curse—guarded by the foremost of
  Rākṣasas, O lord among monkeys, roam everywhere as you please, and by good
  fortune seek out the virtuous daughter of Janaka.”
'52': >-
  Thus ends the third canto, entitled “The Conquest of the Presiding Deity of
  Laṅkā,” in Sundarakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
