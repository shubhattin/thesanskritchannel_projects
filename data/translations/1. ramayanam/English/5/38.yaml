  Now begins the thirty-eighth chapter in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the
  Sundara Kāṇḍa, entitled “The Narration of the Incident of the Crow (Vāyasa).”
'1': >-
  Then that tiger among monkeys, pleased by those words, and skilled in speech,
  having heard Sītā’s statement, addressed her.
'2': >-
  O goddess of auspicious countenance, what you have spoken is fitting and
  well-judged—wholly in keeping with a woman’s nature and with the modesty of
  virtuous ladies.
'3': >-
  Because you are a woman, you are not able to cross the ocean—vast, stretching
  a hundred yojanas—resting upon me and making me your support.
'4': >-
  And the second reason that you, O well-mannered one, speak of—‘I ought not to
  have any association with anyone other than Rāma’—O Jānakī,
'5': >-
  This indeed is becoming of you, O goddess, as the wife of that great-souled
  man. For who else, save you, O goddess, could speak such words as these?
'6': >-
  And Kakutstha will hear everything without remainder—both what you have done,
  O goddess, and what you have spoken before me.
'7': >-
  O goddess, from many reasons—wishing to do what is dear to Rāma, and with a
  mind softened and overflowing with affection—I have spoken thus.
'8': >-
  Because Laṅkā is hard to enter, because the great ocean is difficult to cross,
  and also because of my own ability—therefore have I spoken in this way.
'9': >-
  I desire to bring you back this very day to the delight of the Raghu prince;
  out of deep devotion and reverence I have said this, and not otherwise.
'10': >-
  If, O blameless lady, you do not consent to go with me, then give me some
  token of recognition, so that Rāghava may know for certain.
'11': >-
  Thus addressed by Hanumān, Sītā—like the daughter of the gods—spoke gently,
  her syllables choked and threaded with tears.
'12': >-
  Tell my beloved this excellent token of recognition: at the foot of Mount
  Citrakūṭa, at a spot to the northeast,
'13': >-
  there was a hermitage-dwelling ascetic woman, abounding in roots, fruits, and
  water, in that sacred region frequented by perfected beings, not far from the
  Mandākinī.
'14': >-
  In the groves of that place, fragrant with flowers of many kinds, after
  sporting about, drenched from the water, he sat down upon my lap.
'15': >-
  Then a crow, craving flesh, pecked at him, attracted by the meat. I, lifting
  up a clod of earth, tried to ward off that crow.
'16': >-
  But that crow, while tearing at me, hid there itself; and it did not desist
  from the flesh, for it sought food and lived on offerings.
'17': >-
  While I, angered at that bird, was pulling up the cord of my garment, and as
  my clothing slipped—then indeed you saw me.
'18': >-
  And you laughed at me, while I, angry yet ashamed, came to you—wounded by that
  crow greedy for food.
'19': >-
  Thereafter, wearied, I entered the lap of you who were seated; and you,
  delighting as though in play, comforted and soothed me though I was angry.
'20': >-
  With my face full of tears, gently wiping my two eyes, I was noticed by you, O
  lord, as one provoked and tormented by the crow.
'21': >-
  And from fatigue I slept for a long while upon Rāghava’s lap; and in turn the
  elder brother of Bharata slept upon my lap.
'22': >-
  Then again that same crow approached there; and when I, awakened from sleep,
  rose up from Rāghava’s lap, the crow rushed suddenly and tore me between the
  breasts.
'23': >-
  Again and again, flying up, it tore me exceedingly. Then Rāma rose, seeing the
  drops of blood that had flowed.
'24': >-
  Seeing me then, wounded upon the breasts, that mighty-armed one, breathing
  hard in wrath like a venomous serpent, spoke these words:
'25': >-
  ‘By whom has this space between your breasts been wounded, O one with thighs
  like an elephant’s trunk and a nose like a serpent’s? Who sports in anger like
  a five-hooded serpent?’
'26': >-
  Then, as he looked about, he saw that crow—standing facing me, with sharp
  claws smeared with blood.
'27': >-
  That crow, it is said, was the son of Śakra, the best among birds. It swiftly
  went into a cleft of the earth, equal in speed to the wind.
'28': >-
  Then the mighty-armed Rāma, his eyes inflamed by anger, the foremost of the
  wise, formed a dreadful resolve against that crow.
'29': >-
  Taking up a blade of darbha grass from the spread of kuśa, he charged it with
  Brahmā’s missile; blazing like the fire of time’s dissolution, it flared forth
  against the bird.
'30': >-
  He hurled that blazing darbha toward the crow; and then that darbha pursued
  the crow through the sky.
'31': >-
  Thus released, the crow went in many directions, desiring protection, and
  wandered through this entire world.
'32': >-
  Abandoned by its father and by all the great ṛṣis, after roaming through the
  three worlds it came back to him alone as refuge.
'33': >-
  Kakutstha, worthy to grant refuge, though the crow deserved death, protected
  it with compassion when it had fallen to the ground seeking shelter.
'34': >-
  And he said to it as it fell, distressed and pallid: ‘A Brahmā-weapon cannot
  be made futile; therefore let it be declared what is to be done.’
'35': >-
  Then that weapon destroyed the crow’s right eye. Offering up its right eye, it
  was spared its life.
'36': >-
  Having bowed to Rāma and also to King Daśaratha, released by that hero, it
  returned to its own abode.
'37': >-
  For my sake, even for so little a creature as a crow, you set in motion the
  Brahmā-missile. Why then, O king, do you endure and forgive him who has taken
  me away from you?
'38': >-
  Therefore show great ardor and have compassion upon me, O bull among men.
  Though protected by you, O lord, I appear as one without a protector.
'39': >-
  ‘Non-cruelty (compassion) is the highest dharma’—this I have heard from you. I
  know you to be of great valor, of great enterprise, and of great strength,
'40': >-
  unfathomable, unshakable, deep as the ocean; the lord of the earth together
  with its seas, comparable to Vāsava himself.
'41': >-
  Though you are thus the foremost among those skilled in weapons, powerful and
  steadfast, for what reason, O Rāghava, do you not employ your weapons against
  the rākṣasas?
'42': >-
  Neither nāgas, nor gandharvas, nor gods, nor the hosts of Maruts are able in
  battle to withstand the impetuous force of Rāma.
'43': >-
  If such a mighty one yet has anxiety concerning me, why does he not with sharp
  arrows bring the rākṣasas to destruction?
'44': >-
  Or why does Lakṣmaṇa, scorcher of foes, having received his brother’s
  command—why does that mighty hero not rescue me?
'45': >-
  If those two tiger-like men, equal in splendor to Vāyu and Indra, hard to
  assail even for the gods—why do they disregard me?
'46': >-
  Surely some great sin of mine exists—there is no doubt—since, though able,
  those two scorchers of foes do not look upon me.
'47': >-
  Hearing Vaidehī’s compassionate words, spoken with tears, then the
  great-lustrous Hanumān, leader of the monkey host, replied:
'48': >-
  Rāma is not turned away by your sorrow, O goddess—I swear this to you in
  truth. But when Rāma is afflicted with grief, Lakṣmaṇa too is tormented.
'49': >-
  You have somehow been seen; this is not the time for lamentation. O fair lady,
  you shall behold in this very hour the end of your sorrows.
'50': >-
  Those two tiger-like men, the mighty princes—made resolute by the sight of
  you—will reduce worlds to ashes.
'51': >-
  And having slain in cruel battle Rāvaṇa together with his kinsmen, Rāghava
  will lead you, O large-eyed one, back to his own city.
'52': >-
  Tell me what message is to be conveyed to Rāghava and to mighty Lakṣmaṇa, or
  to the radiant Sugrīva, or to the assembled monkeys.
'53': >-
  When he had spoken thus, Sītā then spoke again: ‘Him whom the high-minded
  Kauśalyā bore—the sustainer of the world—’
'54': >-
  ‘ask after his welfare and happiness on my behalf, and bow your head to him.
  And convey garlands and all jewels to that beloved, noble lady—’
'55': >-
  ‘and that sovereignty, though difficult to obtain even over the vast
  earth—having honored and gladdened both father and mother with due respect—’
'56': >-
  ‘and him for whom Sumitrā, blessed with good sons, followed Rāma into
  exile—Lakṣmaṇa, the righteous-souled one, who with goodwill abandoned
  unsurpassed comfort—’
'57': >-
  ‘he follows Kakutstha, protecting his brother in the forest—broad-shouldered
  like a lion, mighty-armed, high-minded, pleasing to behold—’
'58': >-
  ‘he behaves toward Rāma as toward a father, and toward me as toward a mother.
  Yet when I was being carried away then, the hero Lakṣmaṇa did not know it—’
'59': >-
  ‘he serves the elders, is fortunate, capable, not given to much speech; the
  best among dear princes, worthy of my father-in-law—’
'60': >-
  ‘ever dearer to Rāma than I am is his brother Lakṣmaṇa; and whatever burden he
  is appointed to bear, that the valiant one bears—’
'61': >-
  ‘when Rāghava sees him, he does not fail to remember noble conduct. He should
  be told, in my words, my welfare for my sake—’
'62': >-
  ‘Lakṣmaṇa, ever gentle, pure, and skillful, dear to Rāma—so that, O best of
  monkeys, he may become the bringer of the ending of my sorrow—’
'63': >-
  ‘In accomplishing this task you are the sure means, O leader of the monkey
  host. From your endeavor, Rāghava will be wholly intent on striving for me—’
'64': >-
  ‘And say this again and again to my lord, the heroic Rāma: I shall sustain my
  life for one month, O son of Daśaratha—’
'65': >-
  ‘Beyond a month I shall not live—this I tell you in truth. Imprisoned by
  Rāvaṇa through deceit, that doer of sinful deeds, you must rescue me, O hero,
  as though (delivering) Kauśikī from the very underworld—’
'66': >-
  Then, taking from her garment and loosening it, Sītā gave to Hanumān the
  divine and auspicious crest-jewel, saying, ‘It must be delivered to Rāghava.’
'67': >-
  Having received that unrivaled jewel, the hero fastened it upon his finger;
  for his arm was not slender enough for it.
'68': >-
  The foremost of monkeys, having accepted the jewel and having bowed in
  reverence, circumambulated Sītā and, saluting, stood at her side.
'69': >-
  Filled with great joy born of the sight of Sītā, he bore within his heart Rāma
  and Lakṣmaṇa together with their distinguishing marks.
'70': >-
  Taking up that most precious jewel—worn by the daughter of King Janaka and
  radiant with its own splendor—released like a pearl shaken free by mountain
  winds, he, happy at heart, set out to depart.
'71': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-eighth chapter of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Narration of the Incident of the Crow
  (Vāyasa).”
