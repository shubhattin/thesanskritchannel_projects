  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, is the
  one-hundred-and-ninth canto, called “The Praise of Truth.”
'1': >-
  But when Rāma—best among the truthful-souled—had heard Jābāli’s words, he
  spoke with supreme devotion, and with an understanding that had not gone
  astray.
'2': >-
  For my sake, wishing to accomplish what is dear to me, you have spoken here
  such words—what is not to be done presented as if it were to be done, and what
  is unwholesome measured out as if it were wholesome.
'3': >-
  A man without proper bounds, endowed with sinful conduct, gains no honor among
  the good, for his character is seen to be perverted.
'4': >-
  Whether one be of noble birth or not, or whether one be a hero who prides
  himself on being a man—character alone proclaims whether he is pure or impure.
'5': >-
  One may be ignoble yet appear noble; lacking purity, yet seem pure; without
  good marks, yet seem well-marked; of bad conduct, yet seem virtuous.
'6': >-
  If I were to embrace this confusion of the world—adharma disguised as
  dharma—abandoning what is good, and departing from the ordained rule of right
  action,
'7': >-
  what discerning man in the world, able to distinguish what ought to be done
  from what ought not to be done, would hold me in high esteem—me, of wicked
  behavior, a blemish upon the world?
'8': >-
  Whose conduct would I then imitate, and by whom would I attain heaven, if I
  were to live by this manner—bereft of proper conduct and wanting in my vow?
'9': >-
  Indeed the entire world follows the course of desire; and as are the ways of
  kings, so indeed are the ways of the people.
'10': >-
  Truth alone and compassion are the ancient way of kings; therefore rule should
  be grounded in truth, for the world stands established in truth.
'11': >-
  Sages and gods alike have deemed truth alone to be paramount; for the speaker
  of truth in this world attains the highest end.
'12': >-
  As men shrink away from serpents, so do they shrink away from those who speak
  untruth; dharma is truth in this world, and it is said to be the very root of
  heaven.
'13': >-
  Truth is the Lord in the world; Truth is ever the refuge of Padmā (Śrī,
  Fortune). All things have truth for their root; beyond truth there is no
  higher station.
'14': >-
  Gifts, sacrifices, oblations, and performed austerities—yes, even the
  Vedas—stand established upon truth; therefore one should be devoted to truth.
'15': >-
  One man preserves the world; one man preserves a lineage. One man sinks to
  hell, and one man is honored in heaven.
'16': >-
  Therefore I—who have vowed truth, who am bound to truth, who have made my
  pledge by truth—why should I not carry out my father’s command?
'17': >-
  Not out of greed, nor out of delusion, nor being enshrouded in ignorance and
  darkness, shall I break the embankment of truth—(I), who have pledged truth
  before my father, my guru.
'18': >-
  Of one whose agreement is false, who is wavering and unsteady-minded, we have
  heard that neither the gods nor the forefathers accept his offerings.
'19': >-
  I myself behold this dharma—truth—within my own inner self. It is a burden
  borne by righteous men; for that reason it is held to be weighty and
  authoritative.
'20': >-
  I would renounce the kṣatriya-dharma if it were adharma clothed in the guise
  of dharma—followed by base, cruel, and greedy men, doers of sinful deeds.
'21': >-
  A man commits sin in three ways: by the body, by the mind in deliberate
  intent, and by speaking untruth with the tongue.
'22': >-
  Earth, fame, renown, and prosperity indeed seek after a man; and they also
  behold him established in heaven—therefore one should cleave to truth alone.
'23': >-
  It would indeed be best, O sir, that you, having considered me, spoke these
  words—seemingly reasonable—saying, ‘Do this which is beneficial.’
'24': >-
  But how could I, having promised this forest-dwelling before my guru (my
  father), fulfill Bharata’s word, setting aside my guru’s command?
'25': >-
  My vow was made firm—promised in the presence of my guru; and at that time
  Queen Kaikeyī became rejoicing.
'26': >-
  Dwelling thus in the forest, pure and restrained in food, satisfying the Pitṛs
  and the gods with holy roots, flowers, and fruits,
'27': >-
  I shall maintain the course of life, content with the fivefold offerings, free
  from deceit, endowed with faith, and discerning what ought and ought not to be
  done.
'28': >-
  Having reached this field of action, one must perform the auspicious duty that
  is to be done; Agni, Vāyu, and Soma receive a share of the fruits of actions.
'29': >-
  Having performed a hundred sacrifices, the lord of the gods attained the
  heavenly world; and the great sages, undertaking fierce austerities, went to
  heaven.
'30': >-
  Hearing that cause and ground of atheistic speech, the mighty one—his splendor
  grown more intense in indignation—then spoke, the king’s son, censuring those
  words of his.
'31': >-
  Truth, dharma, valor, compassion toward living beings, and pleasing speech, as
  well as honoring the twice-born, the gods, and guests—this path, the righteous
  call the road to heaven.
'32': >-
  Knowing the meaning thus, in due manner, the brāhmaṇas, adhering to the One
  that rises alone (the One supreme principle), practice dharma fully and
  properly, and, vigilant, they desire attainment of the worlds taught in the
  śāstras.
'33': >-
  I condemn that deed of the king, your father—that he accepted you, whose mind
  had reached a crooked state—one who, moving with such a perverted
  understanding, is a fair-weather ‘atheist,’ departed from the path of dharma.
'34': >-
  For as a thief is, so indeed is the Buddha; know the so-called ‘Tathāgata’
  here to be an atheist. Therefore, no wise man—considering what is most suspect
  among people—should ever turn his face toward an atheist.
'35': >-
  Before you, men of old who were excellent performed many auspicious deeds;
  conquering both this world and the world beyond, therefore the twice-born have
  prospered, and offerings into the sacred fire have been duly made.
'36': >-
  Delighting in dharma, associated with the righteous, radiant, foremost in the
  virtue of giving, non-violent and free from impurity—such chief sages in the
  world become worthy of worship.
'37': >-
  While he was speaking thus—those words, filled with anger—Rāma, the
  great-souled one, whose courage was not cast down, the brāhmaṇa then spoke
  again: words that were true, orthodox, truthful, and accompanied by an appeal.
'38': >-
  I do not declare the doctrine of the atheists; I am not an atheist, nor is
  there nothing at all. Considering the time, I became ‘orthodox’ again; and,
  when the time calls for it, I could again become an ‘atheist.’
'39': >-
  And this time has now come upon us gradually, because of which I uttered those
  atheistic words. It was spoken, O Rāma, for the sake of turning you back, and
  by me it was uttered for the sake of winning your favor.
'40': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-ninth canto, called “The Praise of Truth,” in
  the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
