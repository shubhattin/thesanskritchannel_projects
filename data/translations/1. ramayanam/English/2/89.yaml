  Now begins the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Ayodhya-kanda, the eighty-ninth
  canto, called “The Crossing of the Ganga.”
'1': >-
  Having spent the night there itself on the bank of the Ganga, that scion of
  the Raghus—Bharata—rose at dawn and spoke these words to Shatrughna:
'2': >-
  “Shatrughna, arise—why do you still lie asleep? Quickly bring Guha, the lord
  of the Nishadas. May good be yours! He will ferry the army across the river.”
'3': >-
  Thus urged by his brother, Shatrughna also replied: “I am awake; I do not
  sleep. I am thinking only of that noble elder (Rama).”
'4': >-
  While those two lion-like men were thus speaking with one another, Guha
  arrived at the proper time, and with palms joined in reverence addressed
  Bharata:
'5': >-
  “O Kakutstha, did you pass the night happily here on the river-bank? And is
  all well—free from sickness and distress—with you and with your entire army?”
'6': >-
  Hearing Guha’s words, spoken out of affection, Bharata too—being under the
  sway of love for Rama—answered him, saying:
'7': >-
  “We passed the night in comfort, O king, and we too have been honored by you.
  Let the boatmen ferry us across the Ganga with many boats.”
'8': >-
  Then Guha, hearing Bharata’s command, hastened back and, entering his
  settlement, spoke to his kinsmen and people:
'9': >-
  “Rise up; wake, all of you. May good ever attend you. Draw up the boats in
  readiness—we shall ferry the army across the river.”
'10': >-
  So commanded, they rose up; and, urged by the king’s order, they quickly
  brought, from all directions, five hundred boats at once.
'11': >-
  Some were distinguished by auspicious emblems (svastikas), excellent and
  bearing great bells; well-built and firm, they shone with banners and with
  favorable winds filling them.
'12': >-
  Then Guha brought forward an auspicious boat marked with the svastika, covered
  with pale blankets, sounding with glad cries and altogether propitious. Onto
  it Bharata and mighty Shatrughna mounted.
'13': >-
  Kausalya and Sumitra, and the other royal ladies; and first the chaplain, the
  revered preceptors, and the brahmans; thereafter the wives of the king as
  well, and likewise those with the wagons and merchandise—
'14': >-
  —as they kindled their encampment-fires, bathed at the sacred ford, and lifted
  and took up their goods, a mighty clamor arose that seemed to touch the very
  heaven.
'15': >-
  And those bannered boats, each steered by the boatmen themselves, swiftly
  converged, bearing the people who had embarked upon them.
'16': >-
  Some boats were filled with women; some with horses. Some there carried great
  wealth and heavy goods suited for conveyance by vehicles.
'17': >-
  Having gone to the farther bank, they disembarked those people; then the
  boatmen and their companions returned, performing the various tasks
  appropriate to their work.
'18': >-
  And the elephants, marked with victory (vaijayanta), urged on by their riders,
  crossed over; as they swam they appeared like mountains adorned with banners.
'19': >-
  Others mounted boats; some crossed on rafts. Some crossed with water-pots and
  jars as floats, and others crossed by the strength of their own arms.
'20': >-
  Thus that blessed host was ferried across the Ganga by the boatmen; and at the
  Maitra muhurta it set forth toward the excellent forest of Prayaga.
'21': >-
  Then the great-souled Bharata, having reassured the army and having settled it
  according to what was proper and fitting, set out—accompanied by priests—for
  the sake of seeing Bharadwaja, the foremost of sages.
'22': >-
  Approaching the hermitage of that brahman—of the great-souled Bharadwaja, as
  it were the priest of the gods—he beheld a delightful grove of huts and trees,
  and the vast, lovely forest belonging to that best of brahmans.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-ninth canto of the Ayodhya-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Adi-kavya, called “The Crossing of the Ganga.”
