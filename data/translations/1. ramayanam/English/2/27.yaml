  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-seventh canto, called “The Firm Resolve of the Devoted Wife
  (Paty-vratā).”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed, Vaidehī—worthy of all love and ever speaking what is
  dear—angered only out of affection, spoke these words to her husband.
'2': >-
  “What is this speech, O Rāma, that you utter with such lightness and
  certainty, as though in jest? Hearing this, O best of men, I feel as though I
  have been made the object of ridicule by you.”
'3': >-
  “O king, such a saying, unworthy and bringing disgrace, should not be spoken
  by you—especially to one such as I—when you are a hero, a prince, and one
  learned in weapons and missiles.”
'4': >-
  “O noble prince, father, mother, brother, son, and likewise the
  daughter-in-law—each, enjoying his or her own merits, seeks his or her own
  portion of destiny.”
'5': >-
  “But a woman alone, O bull among men, attains only the fortune of her husband.
  Therefore, I too have been enjoined: ‘You must dwell in the forest’—even so.”
'6': >-
  “Neither father, nor son, nor one’s own self, nor mother, nor friends—none of
  these are, either here or hereafter, the constant refuge of women. The husband
  alone is always their sole resort.”
'7': >-
  “If today itself you set out, O Rāghava, for that hard-to-pass forest, I shall
  go before you, treading down the kuśa grass and the thorns.”
'8': >-
  “Casting away jealousy and wrath, like water left over after drinking, lead
  me, O hero, with full trust. In me there is no sin.”
'9': >-
  “Whether upon the front of a palace, or in aerial cars, or moving through the
  sky—whatever be the condition, the shade of the husband’s feet is pre-eminent
  (for a wife).”
'10': >-
  “I have been instructed by my mother and by my father in many ways, with due
  regard to propriety. It is not for me now to be told how I ought to conduct
  myself.”
'11': >-
  “I shall go to that difficult forest, devoid of men, crowded with herds of
  many kinds of deer, and frequented by troops of tigers.”
'12': >-
  “I shall dwell happily in the forest just as in my father’s house—taking no
  thought for the three worlds, and thinking only of the duty of a devoted
  wife.”
'13': >-
  “Ever attending upon you, always disciplined, living like one vowed to
  continence, I shall sport with you, O hero, in forests fragrant with honey.”
'14': >-
  “For you are indeed able, O Rāma, to provide protection in the forest—even for
  other people; how much more, O bestower of honor, for me!”
'15': >-
  “So I shall go with you to the forest today—of this there is no doubt. O
  greatly fortunate one, I cannot be turned back, now that I am resolved.”
'16': >-
  “Living always on fruits and roots, I shall be—without doubt. Dwelling ever
  with you, I shall not cause you distress.”
'17': >-
  “I shall go before you; and I shall eat after you have eaten. I long
  thereafter to see mountains, marshes, and lakes as well.”
'18': >-
  “Everywhere, fearless because you, my wise lord, are with me, I wish to behold
  lotus-ponds filled with swans and kāraṇḍava ducks, their lotus blooms
  beautifully in flower.”
'19': >-
  “United with you, the hero, I wish, in happiness, to behold them; and, ever
  following you, I shall perform my daily ablutions in those waters.”
'20': >-
  “With you, O large-eyed one, I shall sport, supremely joyful—thus for a
  thousand years, or even a hundred years, together with you.”
'21': >-
  “I shall not know transgression; even heaven itself is not my desire. And if,
  O Rāghava—O tiger among men—life in heaven should come to pass without you,
  even that I do not approve, without you.”
'22': >-
  “I shall go to the forest, most difficult to traverse, abounding in deer and
  also in monkeys and elephants. I shall dwell in the forest as in my father’s
  house, holding fast to your very feet, content therein.”
'23': >-
  “I, whose whole being is fixed on none but you, whose heart is wholly
  devoted—if separated from you—am resolved upon death. Take me with you; do
  well and grant this request. Then there will be no burden upon you because of
  me.”
'24': >-
  “Even though she spoke thus—she who was dear to righteousness—still the best
  of men did not wish to take Sītā. And he spoke many words to her, intent on
  dissuasion, as she stood sorrowful regarding residence in the forest.”
'25': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-seventh canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “The Firm Resolve of the Devoted Wife
  (Paty-vratā).”
