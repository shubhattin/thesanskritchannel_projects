  Now begins the forty-fifth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Entreaty of the Citizens.”
'1': >-
  Deeply attached to the great-souled Rāma—whose prowess was ever truthful and
  unfailing—men followed him as he set forth for his dwelling in the forest.
'2': >-
  Though the king, by the force of friendship and righteousness, was turned back
  with great effort, still those people, having followed Rāma’s chariot, did not
  at all turn back.
'3': >-
  To the men dwelling in Ayodhyā, Rāma of great renown—endowed with every
  excellence—was dear, like the full moon.
'4': >-
  Thus entreated then by those subjects, the scion of Kakutstha—while fulfilling
  his father’s word as true—proceeded only toward the forest.
'5': >-
  Gazing on them with affection, as though drinking them in with his eyes, Rāma
  spoke to those people with tenderness, as to his own subjects.
'6': >-
  “Whatever love and reverence the residents of Ayodhyā bear toward me—let that,
  for my sake, be directed in a special manner toward Bharata.”
'7': >-
  “For he is of auspicious conduct, one who increases Kaikeyī’s joy; he will
  duly accomplish for you what is pleasing as well as what is beneficial.”
'8': >-
  “Mature in understanding, young in years, gentle, yet endowed with heroic
  qualities—he will be a fitting lord for you, one who dispels fear.”
'9': >-
  “Indeed, he is seen to be possessed of kingly virtues, and is the consecrated
  crown prince; moreover, you should also carry out the commands of your lord,
  as instructed by me.”
'10': >-
  “So that the great king (Daśaratha) may not grieve on my account, now that I
  have gone to the forest—let that be done, in my wish to please him.”
'11': >-
  In whatever manner the son of Daśaratha clung to righteousness alone, in that
  very manner did the people, longing for Rāma, desire him as their lord.
'12': >-
  Rāma—wretched, his face veiled with tears—together with Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa),
  seemed to draw along the citizens of the city, as though bound by his virtues.
'13': >-
  Those twice-born (brāhmaṇas), advanced in three ways—by knowledge, by age, and
  by spiritual ardour— their heads trembling with age, spoke these words from
  afar:
'14': >-
  “O swift steeds, bearing Rāma—O noble horses—turn back! He must not be taken
  away. Be benefactors to your master!”
'15': >-
  “For beings have ears, and especially horses. Therefore, having heard our
  entreaty, you should turn back.”
'16': >-
  “Righteous is he, pure-souled, heroic, firm in auspicious vows. Your lord
  ought to be carried (in procession) to the city—not carried away from the city
  to the forest.”
'17': >-
  Hearing those distressed lamentations of the aged twice-born as they spoke,
  Rāma suddenly alighted from the chariot.
'18': >-
  Then, with Sītā and with Lakṣmaṇa, he went on only on foot—placing his steps
  near theirs—Rāma intent upon the forest.
'19': >-
  For Rāma, loving noble conduct, compassionate in gaze, could not bear to
  deliver those twice-born footmen by means of the chariot.
'20': >-
  Seeing Rāma still going onward, their minds bewildered, the
  twice-born—overcome with the deepest sorrow—addressed Rāma with these words:
'21': >-
  “The entirety of brāhmaṇical power and sanctity follows after you; even the
  sacred fires, mounted on the shoulders of the twice-born, go after you!”
'22': >-
  “Behold these parasols, born of the Vājapeya sacrifice, that follow behind
  us—like clouds after the passing of the rains.”
'23': >-
  “You who have not obtained a parasol, and are scorched by the heat of the
  sun—by these our Vājapeya parasols we shall provide you shade.”
'24': >-
  “For that understanding of ours which ever follows the Vedic mantras—O dear
  one—has, for your sake, been made to follow the forest-dwelling.”
'25': >-
  “The Vedas, our supreme wealth, remain established within our hearts; and our
  wives too, guarded by good conduct, will dwell indeed within our homes.”
'26': >-
  “No other resolve should be made; our good and meritorious intention rests
  upon your return. When you, who regard dharma, are concerned—what could remain
  standing upon the path of dharma?”
'27': >-
  “Entreated by us, turn back—by us whose heads are white as swans, whose
  conduct is restrained, and whose heads are dust-stained from falling to the
  ground (in supplication).”
'28': >-
  “Many sacrifices have been spread forth by the twice-born who have come here;
  their completion, O dear one, depends upon your turning back.”
'29': >-
  “Here, beings—moving and unmoving alike—are devoted. When they thus entreat,
  do you show devotion toward your devotees.”
'30': >-
  “Unable to follow you, trees with roots fixed, their swift force checked,
  standing tall—seem to cry out, as though shaken by the rushing wind.”
'31': >-
  “Even the birds—motionless in their feeding and roaming, resolved to remain
  upon a single tree—implore you, who are compassionate to all beings.”
'32': >-
  Thus, amid the cries of those twice-born pleading for his return, there
  appeared there the darkness, as though restraining Rāghava.
'33': >-
  Then Sumantra too, having unyoked the weary horses from the chariot and
  quickly turned them about, let them graze at a distance from the Tamasā—having
  given them water, their bodies drenched all over.
'34': >-
  Thus ends the forty-fifth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “The Entreaty of the Citizens.”
