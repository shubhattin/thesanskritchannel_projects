  Now begins the fifty-fifth canto of the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Curse of Nimi and Vasiṣṭha.”
'1': >-
  “Thus have I narrated to you, in full detail, the account of Nṛga’s curse. If
  there is faith in your hearing, then listen here to yet another tale.”
'2': >-
  When Rāma had spoken thus, Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) again replied: “O King, there
  is no satiety for me in hearing these wondrous narratives.”
'3': >-
  Thus addressed by Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma—the delight of the Ikṣvāku line—began to
  relate a most righteous and supremely dharmic account.
'4': >-
  There was a king named Nimi among the great-souled Ikṣvākus—his son, the
  twelfth in succession—steadfast in valour and firmly established in dharma as
  well.
'5': >-
  That king, endowed with prowess, then established a city, resembling a
  celestial city, in the vicinity of Gautama.
'6': >-
  That city’s well-wrought settlement was heard of by the name Sukṛta, and also
  as Vaijayanta—where the highly renowned royal sage Nimi made his abode.
'7': >-
  After founding that exceedingly great city, this thought arose in him: “By a
  long sacrificial session (dīrgha-satra) I shall perform a sacrifice,
  gladdening my father’s heart.”
'8': >-
  Then, having invited his father Ikṣvāku, the son of Manu, he first chose
  Vasiṣṭha—the foremost among brahmarṣis—as his officiating priest.
'9': >-
  Thereafter that royal sage Nimi, delight of the Ikṣvāku race, chose also Atri,
  Aṅgiras, and Bhṛgu—those ascetics rich in austerity.
'10': >-
  But Vasiṣṭha said to Nimi, the best of royal sages: “I was previously chosen
  by Indra; wait meanwhile, maintaining the interval.”
'11': >-
  Thereupon the great brahmin Gautama fulfilled that request in the meantime;
  and Vasiṣṭha also, possessed of great splendour, then performed Indra’s
  sacrifice.
'12': >-
  But King Nimi, lord of men, having assembled those brahmins, performed his
  sacrifice near his own city, by the side of Himavat. For five thousand years
  the king entered upon the vow of consecration (dīkṣā).
'13': >-
  When Indra’s sacrifice had ended, the blessed sage
  Vasiṣṭha—irreproachable—came to the king’s presence to perform the priestly
  office (as hotṛ).
'14': >-
  But in that interval he saw that the rite had been completed by Gautama.
  Seized by great wrath, Vasiṣṭha, the son of Brahmā, became inflamed with
  anger.
'15': >-
  Desiring an audience with the king, he sat waiting for a muhūrta; but on that
  day the royal sage was heavily overpowered by sleep.
'16': >-
  Then the anger of the great-souled Vasiṣṭha arose; and because the royal sage
  did not appear before him, he began to utter a curse.
'17': >-
  “Since, O earthly king, you have chosen another, slighting me—your body shall
  come to be without consciousness, bereft of awareness.”
'18': >-
  Then the royal sage, awakened, hearing the curse pronounced, spoke to
  him—Vasiṣṭha, born of Brahmā—in agitation, his mind overcome by wrath.
'19': >-
  “Though I lay sleeping unknowing, you, stained by anger, have released upon me
  the fire of a curse—like another staff of Yama.”
'20': >-
  “Therefore, O brahmarṣi, you too shall have a body made without
  consciousness—of exceedingly fair appearance—without doubt.”
'21': >-
  Thus, at that time, the king and the chief of twice-born ones, both under the
  sway of wrath, cursed one another; and at once they became bodiless (videha),
  each attaining a potency and state equal to the other.
'22': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fifth canto of the Uttara Kāṇḍa in the sacred, glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa—the primordial epic—entitled “The Curse of Nimi and
  Vasiṣṭha.”
