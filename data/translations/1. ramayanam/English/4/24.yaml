  Now, in the sacred Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-fourth canto called “The Consolation of Sugrīva and Tārā.”
'1': >-
  Beholding her—swiftly overwhelmed by the great ocean of sorrow, hard to
  approach in its vehemence—Vāli’s younger brother, the mighty Sugrīva, burned
  within by the incomparable slaying of his brother.
'2': >-
  With his face filled with tears, and his mind—though strong—becoming in an
  instant dejected, he went slowly to Rāma’s presence, surrounded by attendants,
  utterly distressed.
'3': >-
  Reaching him, he addressed Rāghava, who stood there—bow in hand, bearing lofty
  splendour, his arrows like venomous serpents, renowned, and marked on his
  limbs by auspicious signs.
'4': >-
  “O lord of men, what you promised has been done by you; and the deed has borne
  visible fruit. But today, O son of the king, my heart—like one whose very life
  has been struck down—has withdrawn from all enjoyments.
'5': >-
  “While this chief queen weeps bitterly, and the city, scorched by grief, wails
  aloud; while the king is slain, and even Aṅgada’s fate is uncertain—my mind, O
  Rāma, finds no delight in the kingdom.
'6': >-
  “Out of anger, out of resentment, out of excessive violence, my brother’s
  death was formerly consented to by me. But now that this leader of the
  monkey-host has been slain, O best of the Ikṣvākus, I shall suffer a keen
  torment.
'7': >-
  “Today I deem it better for me to dwell long upon that foremost of mountains,
  Ṛṣyamūka; for though I lived there, conducting myself in whatever manner by my
  own way of life, the gain of heaven was not to be had by killing him like
  this.
'8': >-
  “That great-souled, wise one said to me, ‘I do not wish to slay you—go on.’
  This, O Rāma—my words and deeds—are fitting only in accordance with that very
  word of yours.
'9': >-
  “How indeed could a brother of great worth approve, O Rāma, the slaying of his
  brother—even if, thinking over the essence of kingdom and of suffering, he
  were driven by desire?
'10': >-
  “His death was not my intent—lest I overstep my own greatness; but through the
  wickedness of my understanding, I committed an offence that took his life.
'11': >-
  “Broken by the blow of a tree-branch, I lay groaning for a moment; and after
  consoling me, you said, ‘You ought not to do it again.’”
'12': >-
  “By him, brotherhood, noble conduct, and dharma were protected; while by me,
  anger and desire and the very nature of a monkey were displayed.
'13': >-
  “I have reached this sin, O friend—unthinkable, to be shunned, not to be
  desired, not to be looked upon—through the slaying of my brother, like Indra
  through the slaying of Vṛtra.
'14': >-
  “The sin of Indra was apportioned at will to the earth, to water, to trees,
  and to women. Who could bear this sin? Who would wish to accept it for a
  branch-roving monkey?
'15': >-
  “I do not deserve this honour from the subjects—nor the post of crown-prince,
  much less the kingship—having done such a deed, O Rāghava, bound up with
  adharma and tending to the ruin of my line.
'16': >-
  “I am the doer of a censured sin—petty, and harmful to the world in the eyes
  of men. A great grief comes upon me, like the rushing force of rain-water
  descending into a low-lying place.
'17': >-
  “This elephant of sin strikes me—its hide the slaying of one’s own brother,
  its limbs another’s flesh, its hands and eyes and head and tusks made of
  burning torment—like a maddened elephant, grown huge, assailing a river-bank.
'18': >-
  “Alas! This is intolerable, O best of men. The good conduct within my heart
  turns back, as gold, when heated in fire, throws off its black dross, O
  Rāghava.
'19': >-
  “This lineage of mighty leaders of monkey-hosts, O Rāghava, has been ruined
  because of me. And even Aṅgada, from the fever of grief, I think has his life
  as it were hanging by half.
'20': >-
  “A son may be obtained again; a good man may be found; one who is obedient may
  be had—but where is a son like Aṅgada? Nor is there any land of heroes where
  such closeness to one’s own brother is found again.
'21': >-
  “Today Aṅgada, best of heroes, may not live; and if his mother lives, it will
  be only for the sake of protecting him. But without her son, consumed by
  anguish, she will surely not live—this is my conviction.
'22': >-
  “Therefore I shall enter a blazing fire, desiring friendship with my brother
  and with his son. These foremost of monkeys will then go forth, acting
  according to command, in search of Sītā.
'23': >-
  “This entire task of yours will be accomplished, even after I am gone, O
  prince of men. Permit me, O Rāma—the destroyer of the line, unworthy to
  live—me who have committed offence.”
'24': >-
  Hearing thus the words of the afflicted Sugrīva, who had become the slayer of
  Vāli, Rāma—slayer of hostile heroes—was filled with tears, and for a moment
  became downcast.
'25': >-
  At that moment, Rāma—patient as the earth, guardian of the world—looking
  repeatedly, eager, beheld Tārā, weeping and sunk in calamity.
'26': >-
  The chief ministers then raised up the king’s wife, Tārā—she of lovely eyes,
  queen of the lion-lord among monkeys—who was lying then, clasping her husband,
  her spirit faint.
'27': >-
  Quivering, though held and drawn away from her husband’s side, she saw Rāma
  with bow and arrows in hand, blazing by his own splendour like the sun.
'28': >-
  Seeing him well composed, marked with royal signs—him, the handsome-eyed
  one—Tārā, herself doe-eyed, understood: “This is that foremost of men,
  Kakutstha, whom I have never seen before.”
'29': >-
  Tārā—noble lady—having fallen into sudden calamity, bewildered, hurried to the
  presence of that Indra-like, unapproachable, great-souled one.
'30': >-
  Approaching Rāma—pure in spirit—her bodily state unsettled by grief, the wise
  Tārā spoke to him, who had won his aim by prowess in battle.
'31': >-
  “You are immeasurable and unassailable; you are self-controlled and devoted to
  the highest dharma; your fame is undiminishing; you are discerning; you are
  patient like the earth; your eyes are like fresh blood.
'32': >-
  “With bow, arrow, and quiver taken up—an arrow in your hand—you are of great
  strength and well knit in frame; and, setting aside mere human embodiment, you
  are endowed with a divine exaltation of body.
'33': >-
  “With that very arrow by which my beloved was slain, with that same arrow slay
  me too. Slain, I shall go to his presence; for without me, O hero, Vālī will
  not take delight.
'34': >-
  “Even in heaven, lotus-pure-petalled-eyed, meeting and looking upon me, if he
  does not see me, he will not consort with those apsarases—wearing wondrous
  garb, with crests of coppery hue—high or low.
'35': >-
  “Even in heaven, the hero Vālī will, without me, attain grief and pallor—just
  as you, without the princess of Videha, would be without joy on the lovely
  slopes and spaces of the lord of mountains.
'36': >-
  “You know how a young man, bereft of a woman, comes to sorrow. Therefore,
  knowing this, slay me—so that Vālī may not suffer the pain born of not seeing
  me.
'37': >-
  “And if you, great-souled one, should think there would be the fault of
  killing a woman—then slay me, for I am his very own; thus it will not be
  ‘slaying a woman,’ O son of the lord of men.
'38': >-
  “By the application of the śāstras and by the Vedas in diverse ways, a man’s
  wife is not other than his own self. Indeed, among the wise in this world, no
  gift is seen greater than the giving of one’s wife.
'39': >-
  “And you too will bestow me upon that beloved of mine, O hero, having regard
  to dharma. By this gift you will not incur association with adharma through
  the slaying of my hero.”
'40': >-
  “You ought not to kill me—afflicted, without refuge, and being led away in
  such a state. For I, without that wise bull among monkeys, whose gait was like
  the sport of an elephant, and who was adorned with a splendid garland of
  finest gold—shall not be able to live long, O king.”
'41': >-
  Thus addressed, the mighty great-souled Rāma comforted Tārā and spoke what was
  beneficial: “O wife of a hero, do not entertain such a misguided thought; the
  whole world is ordered by the Creator.
'42': >-
  “That entire conjunction of happiness and sorrow is spoken of by the world as
  having been wrought by the Disposer. The ordinances established by him are not
  transgressed by the three worlds, for they are under his control.
'43': >-
  “You will attain supreme contentment thus, and your son will obtain the
  crown-princeship. Such indeed is the ordinance laid down by the Creator; the
  wives of the valiant do not lament overmuch.”
'44': >-
  Thus reassured by that great-souled Rāma—endowed with majesty, scorcher of
  foes—Tārā, the hero’s wife, her mouth still sounding with sobs, yet fair in
  her attire and form, ceased from her wailing.
'45': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fourth canto, called “The Consolation of Sugrīva and
  Tārā,” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
