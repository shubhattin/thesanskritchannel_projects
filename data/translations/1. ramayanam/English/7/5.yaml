'0': >-
  Then, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara Kāṇḍa, begins the fifth
  chapter, called “The Birth of the Progeny beginning with Mālyavān.”
'1': >-
  Beholding Sukesha—the righteous rākṣasa, who had obtained boons—there was a
  Gandharva named Grāmaṇī, resplendent like Viśvāvasu.
'2': >-
  He had a daughter named Devavatī, a second Śrī as it were, born of his very
  self—renowned in the three worlds, possessed of beauty and youthful charm. Her
  he gave, in accordance with dharma, to Sukesha, as though bestowing upon him
  the very prosperity of the rākṣasas.
'3': >-
  Having obtained that beloved husband, endowed with lordship through the fruit
  of boons, Devavatī became satisfied—like a poor man who, upon gaining wealth,
  is filled with contentment.
'4': >-
  United with her, that rājani-cara (night-roamer) shone forth in splendour—like
  a great elephant just come out from the Anjanā grove, with a female elephant
  at his side.
'5': Now Sukesha, O Rāghava, begot offspring upon Devavatī.
'6': >-
  He begot three sons, whose forms were like the three sacred fires—Mālyavān,
  and Sumāli, and Māli, the foremost among the mighty—three rākṣasa princes,
  resembling the three-eyed Lord (Śiva) in their power.
'7': >-
  They stood unperturbed like the three worlds, like three blazing fires; fierce
  like three mantras of dreadful potency, and terrible like three grievous
  diseases.
'8': >-
  These three sons of Sukesha, equal in brilliance to the three sacred fires,
  grew and flourished there—like maladies that are neglected and thus increase.
'9': >-
  Knowing that their father had obtained boons by the power of sovereignty
  gained through austerity, the brothers—firmly resolved—went to Mount Meru to
  practise tapas.
'10': >-
  Taking up frightful restraints and strict observances, those rākṣasas, O best
  of kings, performed terrible austerities, bringing fear to all beings.
'11': >-
  Endowed with truth, straightforwardness, and self-restraint, by austerities
  exceedingly hard to accomplish, they tormented the three worlds—together with
  the devas, asuras, and men.
'12': >-
  Then the mighty four-faced Lord (Brahmā), seated in a most excellent aerial
  car, addressed the sons of Sukesha and said, “I am the giver of boons.”
'13': >-
  Knowing Brahmā to be the bestower of boons, surrounded by the hosts of gods
  with Indra, they all spoke with joined palms—trembling like trees.
'14': >-
  “O Deva, if, being pleased by our austerity, you will grant us a boon—may we
  be unconquerable, slayers of our enemies, and likewise long-lived.”
'15': >-
  “And may we become possessed of mastery and power”—thus, in mutual accord and
  faithful to one another, they entreated.
'16': >-
  Saying, “So it shall be,” the mighty Brahmā granted the boon to the sons of
  Sukesha and then departed for Brahmaloka—Brahmā, who is affectionate to the
  brāhmaṇas.
'17': >-
  Having obtained the boon, all those night-roamers then, O Rāma, free from fear
  because of that boon, began to harass both suras and asuras.
'18': >-
  Being slain by them, the thirty gods—together with hosts of ṛṣis and bands of
  Cāraṇas—could find no protector, like men who have fallen into hell.
'19': >-
  Then those rākṣasas, delighted, approached Viśvakarmā—the foremost and
  imperishable among craftsmen—and spoke to him, O best of the Raghu line.
'20': >-
  “You alone, by your own splendour, are the maker of dwellings for the
  great—those endowed with vigour, radiance, and strength—(creating) what is
  desired in the hearts of the gods.”
'21': >-
  “So also, O great-minded one, make for us a residence. Taking refuge either on
  Himavān, or on Meru or Mandara, let a vast mansion be built for us—like the
  dwelling of Maheśvara.”
'22': >-
  Then Viśvakarmā, mighty-armed, described to those rākṣasas a residence—like
  Amarāvatī of Śakra himself.
'23': >-
  “On the shore of the southern ocean there is a mountain named Trikūṭa; and
  there is another, called Suvela—both of them excellent.”
'24': >-
  “On the summit of that mountain, in its middle region, cloud-like in
  appearance—hard to reach even for birds—its four directions hewn sheer by the
  chisel—”
'25': >-
  “—spread across thirty yojanas and extending a hundred yojanas in length,
  surrounded by a golden rampart, adorned with golden gateways—”
'26': >-
  “—a city called Laṅkā has been built by me at Śakra’s command. Dwell in it, O
  unconquerable heroes, foremost among rākṣasas.”
'27': >-
  “As the dwellers in heaven, with Indra, attain Amarāvatī, so shall
  you—surrounded by many rākṣasas—attain the fortress-city of Laṅkā.”
'28': “You will be hard to assail, and destroyers of the enemies of your foes.”
'29': >-
  Hearing the words of Viśvakarmā, those best of rākṣasas—becoming attended by a
  thousand followers—went and dwelt in that city.
'30': >-
  Having reached Laṅkā—fortified with strong ramparts and moats, and surrounded
  by hundreds of golden mansions—those night-roamers rejoiced and took up
  residence there.
'31': >-
  At that very time, O Rāghava—according to desire—there was a Gandharvī named
  Narmadā, O delight of the Raghu line.
'32': >-
  She had three daughters, of splendour equal to intelligence, fortune, and
  fame; in order of seniority she became the rākṣasī-consort of those rākṣasas.
'33': >-
  That joyous lady, moon-faced, gave those daughters—three Gandharva maidens—to
  the three rākṣasa lords.
'34': >-
  Those highly fortunate brides were given when the nakṣatra Bhaga was the
  presiding deity; and then, O Rāma, the sons of Sukesha became householders.
'35': >-
  They sported with their wives like immortals with apsarases. Then, Mālyavān’s
  wife—named Sundarī, herself truly beautiful—
'36': >-
  begot offspring upon her; understand from me what that progeny was:
  Vajramuṣṭi, Virūpākṣa, and Durmukha—rākṣasas—
'37': >-
  Suptaghna, Yajñakopa, and also Matta and Unmatta; and a daughter was
  born—Analā—(all) from Sundarī, O Rāma.
'38': >-
  Sumāli too had a wife, moon-faced, named Ketumatī, O Rāma—dearer to him even
  than his very lives.
'39': >-
  Sumāli, that night-roamer, begot offspring upon Ketumatī, O great king; hear
  from me that lineage in due order.
'40': >-
  Prahastha, and Akampana, and Vikaṭa, and Kālakārmukha; and Dhūmrākṣa, and
  Daṇḍa, and Supārśva of great strength;—
'41': >-
  Saṃhrādi and Praghāsa as well; and the rākṣasa Bhāsakarṇa; (and the daughters)
  Rākā, Puṣpotkaṭā, Kaikasī—she of fair smiles—and Kumbhīnasī: these are
  remembered as the offspring of Sumāli.
'42': >-
  But Māli’s wife was a Gandharvī named Vasudhā, possessed of
  beauty—lotus-petaled-eyed, lovely-eyed, comparable to the best of yakṣiṇīs.
'43': >-
  Māli—the younger brother of Sumāli—begot on her offspring, O lord; and as I
  recount it, do you listen, O Rāghava.
'44': >-
  Anila, Anala, Hara, and Sampāti: these night-roamers, born of Māli, became the
  ministers of Vibhīṣaṇa.
'45': >-
  Thereafter those three foremost rākṣasas, surrounded by their night-roaming
  sons in hundreds, intoxicated with their great valour, afflicted the gods with
  Indra, and the ṛṣis, nāgas, and yakṣas.
'46': >-
  Roaming through the world like the wind, unapproachable, in battle possessing
  a radiance akin to Death itself—exceedingly puffed up because of the granting
  of boons—they were ever makers of cessation and disruption of sacrificial
  rites.
'47': >-
  Thus ends the fifth chapter in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Birth of the Progeny beginning with Mālyavān.”
