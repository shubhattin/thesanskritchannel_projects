  Now begins the seventy-second sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Bharata’s Anguish.”
'1': >-
  Then, not seeing his father there in his father’s own palace, Bharata went to
  see his mother in his mother’s residence.
'2': >-
  But Kaikeyī, seeing her son returned from his absence, sprang up at once in
  delight, abandoning her golden seat.
'3': >-
  Entering his own dwelling, bereft of splendor, righteous-souled Bharata, on
  seeing (his mother), took hold of his mother’s auspicious feet.
'4': >-
  She kissed that illustrious one upon the head and embraced him; then, placing
  Bharata upon her lap, she began to question him.
'5': >-
  “Today how many nights has it been since you left your grandfather’s house?
  And did no weariness from the road come upon you as you hurried here by
  chariot?”
'6': >-
  “Is your grandfather well—(and) your maternal uncle Yudhājit, the conqueror in
  battle? And, my son, you must tell me everything: was your stay abroad
  comfortable?”
'7': >-
  Thus questioned by Kaikeyī, Bharata—delight of the king—lotus-eyed, related
  everything to his mother.
'8': >-
  “Today is my seventh night since I left my grandfather’s house. My grandfather
  is well, mother, and my maternal uncle Yudhājit as well.”
'9': >-
  “The wealth and jewels which the king—of great austerity—gave me became
  burdensome on the road; therefore I arrived first (ahead of the convoy).”
'10': >-
  “Urged on by royal messengers who had come in haste, I have returned quickly.
  What I wish to ask, mother—you ought to tell me that.”
'11': >-
  “This couch of yours, this bed adorned with gold, is empty; and this people of
  the Ikṣvāku line does not appear to me as joyful.”
'12': >-
  “The king is most often here, in mother’s residence; yet today I do not see
  him—though I have come here desiring to see him.”
'13': >-
  “I shall take my father’s feet (in reverence). Tell me, when I ask—whether he
  is, perhaps, in my eldest mother Kauśalyā’s residence?”
'14': >-
  To him Kaikeyī replied—speaking pleasing words that were dreadful and
  unwelcome—she who, knowing (the truth) while he did not know it, was deluded
  by greed for sovereignty.
'15': >-
  “The course which is the destiny of all beings—your father has gone that way.
  The great-souled, radiant king, a sacrificer, has attained the path of the
  good.”
'16': >-
  Hearing those words, Bharata—pure, born in a noble lineage, devoted to
  dharma—suddenly fell upon the earth, afflicted by the force of grief for his
  father.
'17': >-
  Crying out in a wretched, miserable voice, “Alas, I am undone!”, the
  mighty-armed, valiant one fell down, flinging his arms about.
'18': >-
  Then, enveloped in sorrow and anguished by his father’s death, the great and
  radiant Bharata lamented, bewildered and with senses thrown into confusion.
'19': >-
  “Formerly this beautiful bed of my father shone—like the spotless moonlit sky
  at night when the rain-clouds have passed away.”
'20': >-
  “But today it does not shine, bereft of that wise one—like the heaven without
  the moon, like a sea drained of its waters.”
'21': >-
  Pouring forth tears, his throat choked and his very self oppressed, the best
  among victors covered his face with a splendid cloth.
'22': >-
  Seeing him fallen on the ground—anguished, godlike in appearance—like the
  trunk of a sāla tree cut down with an axe in the forest,
'23': >-
  (Kaikeyī) lifted him up—he who resembled an intoxicated elephant, like the
  moon and sun upon the earth—and, pained with grief, spoke these words:
'24': >-
  “Rise, rise! Why do you lie thus, O prince of great fame? Men like you do not
  grieve; the good, esteemed in assemblies, do not (so) lament.”
'25': >-
  “Your intellect—endowed with understanding—follows the discipline of gifts and
  sacrifices, good conduct, learning, and right speech; it is like the radiance
  of the sun within a palace.”
'26': >-
  But after weeping for a long time and rolling upon the ground, Bharata—covered
  over by many sorrows—answered his mother thus:
'27': >-
  “(Thinking,) ‘The king will consecrate Rāma, and then will perform a
  sacrifice,’ I, having formed that resolve, set out joyfully on my journey.”
'28': >-
  “But now all has turned out otherwise; my mind is shattered, for I do not see
  my father, ever intent on what was dear and beneficial (to me).”
'29': >-
  “Mother, by what illness did the king depart, when I had not yet returned?
  Blessed are Rāma and all the rest, by whom my father was duly consecrated
  (with the final rites) with their own hands.”
'30': >-
  “Surely the great king, renowned in fame, did not know that I had arrived; for
  father would have quickly bowed and kissed me upon the head.”
'31': >-
  “Where is that hand of my father—whose touch was comforting—he of unwearied
  deeds, with which he would again and again wipe away the dust that covered
  me?”
'32': >-
  “He who is my brother, my father, my kinsman—whose servant I am, that wise
  one—tell me quickly of that Rāma of untroubled deeds.”
'33': >-
  “For the eldest becomes a father to one who understands the dharma of the
  noble. I shall take hold of his feet; for now he is my refuge.”
'34': >-
  “Rāma is a knower of dharma, ever established in dharma; steadfast in truth,
  firm in his vows. What did the king, my father—true in valor—say to him?”
'35': >-
  “I wish to hear the final message—good counsel—for myself.” Thus asked,
  Kaikeyī spoke words that were in accordance with the facts.
'36': >-
  “Lamenting, ‘Rāma!’ and ‘Ah Sītā!’ and ‘Lakṣmaṇa!’ the great-souled one—best
  among those who go to their destined end—departed to the highest world.”
'37': >-
  “This was the last speech uttered by your father—overcome by the law of Time
  and Death, like a great elephant bound with nooses.”
'38': >-
  “Men who have their desires fulfilled will see Rāma returned again, together
  with Sītā, and mighty-armed Lakṣmaṇa returned as well.”
'39': >-
  Hearing that, Bharata sank down, struck by the second piece of dear tidings;
  becoming downcast of face, he again questioned his mother:
'40': >-
  “And where now is that righteous-souled Rāma—he who increased Kauśalyā’s
  joy—gone together with his brother Lakṣmaṇa and with Sītā?”
'41': >-
  Thus asked as to the truth, his mother began to relate it—at once, speaking
  words unwelcome, yet with an expectation that they might be taken as welcome.
'42': >-
  “That prince, my son, clad in bark-garments, has gone to the great forest of
  Daṇḍaka, with Vaidehī; and Lakṣmaṇa has gone as his attendant.”
'43': >-
  Hearing that, Bharata, terrified—suspecting some misconduct on his brother’s
  part—began to question (her), mindful of the greatness of his own lineage:
'44': >-
  “Has Rāma taken any brahmin’s wealth? Has some rich man or some poor
  man—innocent and sinless—been harmed by him?”
'45': >-
  “Does the prince desire another’s wife? Why has he been banished to the
  Daṇḍaka forest as though he were a slayer of an unborn child?”
'46': >-
  Then his fickle mother, according to her own deed as it truly was—moved by
  that very womanly nature (as described here)—began to speak.
'47': >-
  Thus addressed by great-souled Bharata, Kaikeyī—delighted, yet foolish,
  thinking herself wise—spoke these words:
'48': >-
  “Rāma has taken no brahmin’s wealth whatsoever; and no rich man or poor
  man—innocent and sinless—has been harmed by him.”
'49': >-
  “Nor does Rāma even look upon another man’s wife with his eyes. But I, my
  son—having only heard of Rāma’s consecration—(took action).”
'50': >-
  “Your father was petitioned (by me) for the kingdom for you, and for Rāma’s
  banishment. And your father, adhering to his own pledged conduct, did so.”
'51': >-
  “And Rāma, together with Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), was sent away with Sītā. Not
  seeing his beloved son, the glorious protector of the earth—”
'52': >-
  “—sunk in grief for his son, met with the state of the five elements (that is,
  he died). But now you, knower of dharma, must take up kingship.”
'53': >-
  “For your sake, all this, of such a kind, has been done by me. Do not grieve,
  do not burn with anguish; take refuge in steadiness, my son.”
'54': >-
  “For the city and this untroubled kingdom depend upon you. Therefore, my son,
  quickly—according to rite, together with the best of twice-born ones, with
  Vasiṣṭha at their head—having assembled the king (and his ministers) of
  undismayed spirit, have yourself consecrated upon the earth.”
'55': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-second sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred,
  illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “Bharata’s Anguish.”
