  Now begins the eighty-ninth canto (Sarga), named “The Kindling of Saumitri’s
  Battle-fury,” in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Thereupon Dāśarathi Lakṣmaṇa, the subduer of foes, fitting arrows to his bow,
  in wrath—hissing like a serpent—discharged them at the lord of the rākṣasas
  (Indrajit).
'2': >-
  Hearing the terrible twang and reverberation of his bowstring, the overlord of
  the rākṣasas became pale-faced and fixed his gaze upon Lakṣmaṇa.
'3': >-
  Seeing that son of Rāvaṇa, the rākṣasa, with his countenance turned wan,
  Vibhīṣaṇa spoke to Saumitri, who was engaged in the combat.
'4': >-
  “I perceive omens appearing in this son of Rāvaṇa. Make haste, O mighty-armed
  one! He is broken—of this there is no doubt.”
'5': >-
  Then Saumitri, joining to his bow arrows like venomous serpents, let fly those
  shafts at him—like dreadful snakes laden with poison.
'6': >-
  Struck by Lakṣmaṇa’s arrows, whose touch was like Indra’s thunderbolt,
  Indrajit became stupefied for a moment, all his senses thrown into confusion.
'7': >-
  Regaining awareness in a moment, his faculties returning, he beheld the hero,
  Daśaratha’s son, standing firm in the battle. Then, his eyes reddened with
  rage, he rushed upon Saumitri.
'8': >-
  Closing in on him, he again spoke harsh words: “Do you not remember my prowess
  in the first battle—when, bound fast together with your brother, you writhed
  upon the field?”
'9': >-
  “Indeed, you two in that great battle, struck down at first to the earth by
  arrows like thunderbolts, lay senseless, with your leaders (your chiefs)
  before you.”
'10': >-
  “Either, I think, you have no memory—or plainly you desire to go to Yama’s
  abode, since you wish to assail and affront me.”
'11': >-
  “If in the first battle you did not behold my prowess, today I shall show it
  to you. Stand now, fixed in your place!”
'12': >-
  Having spoken thus, he pierced Lakṣmaṇa with seven arrows; and Hanūmān with
  ten excellent shafts, keen-edged and razor-sharp.
'13': >-
  Then, with a full hundred arrows, expertly discharged, that mighty warrior—his
  fury doubled in wrath—also struck and tore into Vibhīṣaṇa.
'14': >-
  Seeing this deed done by Indrajit, Rāma’s younger brother, without giving it a
  thought, laughed and said, “This is nothing at all.”
'15': >-
  And the bull among men, Lakṣmaṇa—unafraid of face, and wrathful in
  battle—grasped and released dreadful arrows against Rāvaṇa’s son.
'16': >-
  “Not thus do heroes who have entered the battlefield strike, O night-ranger.
  These arrows of yours are easy to bear—light, and of little power.”
'17': >-
  “Not thus do the valiant, longing for battle, fight in war.” Saying so, the
  archer showered him with arrows.
'18': >-
  By his arrows, Indrajit’s great golden armor, well-shattered, was rent and
  fell upon the chariot-seat—like a net of stars dropping from the sky.
'19': >-
  His armor shaken off, wounded by iron-pointed shafts, that hero Indrajit in
  the battle looked like the sun at dawn, crimson-hued.
'20': >-
  Then, enraged, the son of Rāvaṇa—terrible in valor—pierced Lakṣmaṇa in the
  fight with a thousand arrows.
'21': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa’s own great and divine armor was torn away; and those two subduers of
  enemies became matched in giving and receiving blows.
'22': >-
  Breathing again and again, the two fought a tumultuous combat on the
  field—limb after limb cut by arrows, and drenched everywhere with blood.
'23': >-
  For a very long time those two heroes—great-souled, skilled in the arts of
  war—hewed at one another with sharp arrows. And those two, of dreadful
  prowess, were intent upon victory over the other.
'24': >-
  Thus filled with torrents of arrows, their armor and standards cut down, both
  poured forth hot blood—like two mountain springs sending out streams of water.
'25': >-
  As the two loosed a fearful rain of arrows, with an awesome roar, it was like
  two dark-blue storm-clouds in the sky pouring down their showers.
'26': >-
  A great span of time passed as they fought in battle, and yet neither of them
  turned away from the fight, nor did weariness come upon them.
'27': >-
  Those two foremost among masters of weapons displayed their missiles again and
  again, and bound the mid-air with arrows of various kinds—high and low.
'28': >-
  Casting without fault, swiftly, wondrously, and with perfect skill, those man
  and rākṣasa together created a tumultuous and dreadful combat.
'29': >-
  Separately from each of them was heard a frightful sound, the clang as of
  blows; it produced trembling, like a terrible thunderclap.
'30': >-
  So resplendent was the noise of those two, intoxicated with battle—of the two
  most dreadful ones as they roared—like thunderous clouds in the sky.
'31': >-
  With golden-feathered, iron-pointed shafts, both powerful and wounded, those
  two illustrious ones—steadfast in their resolve for victory—poured forth
  blood.
'32': >-
  In the fight, the arrows with golden shafts that fell upon their bodies,
  smeared with blood, flew out again and plunged into the earth.
'33': >-
  Others, with very sharp weapons, collided in the sky; and their arrows, by the
  thousand, broke and were severed apart.
'34': >-
  Fearful was that battle, a piled mass made of arrows between them—like,
  between two blazing fires, a heap of sacrificial kuśa-grass.
'35': >-
  The wounded bodies of those two great-souled warriors shone forth—like the
  kiṃśuka and śālmali trees in a forest, leafless yet full of blossoms.
'36': >-
  Again and again they brought about a tumultuous, dreadful clash—Indrajit and
  Lakṣmaṇa—each seeking victory over the other.
'37': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa struck Rāvaṇa’s son in the battle, and Rāvaṇa’s son struck Lakṣmaṇa;
  smiting one another, neither of the two gave way to fatigue.
'38': >-
  With nets of arrows lodged deep within their bodies, those two impetuous
  warriors of great might shone—like two mountains overgrown (with dense
  growth).
'39': >-
  Their limbs, drenched in blood and thickly covered with arrows, blazed forth
  on every side like fires aflame.
'40': >-
  A great span of time passed as they fought; yet neither of them turned away
  from battle, nor did exhaustion overtake them.
'41': >-
  Then, to remove Lakṣmaṇa’s battle-weariness—Lakṣmaṇa, unconquered in the
  forefront of combats—the great-souled Vibhīṣaṇa, accomplishing what was both
  dear and beneficial, came up to the battle and took his stand.
'42': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-ninth canto, named “The Kindling of Saumitri’s
  Battle-fury,” in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
