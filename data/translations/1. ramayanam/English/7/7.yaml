'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins the seventh
  canto, named “The Slaying of Māli.”
'1': >-
  Those rākṣasas—like roaring masses of cloud—thundered forth upon Mount
  Nārāyaṇa, and poured a rain of arrows, even as rain-bearing clouds pour down
  upon a mountain in the season of rains.
'2': >-
  The all-pervading Viṣṇu, dark and radiant, was encompassed by those foremost
  of night-rangers, blue-black as collyrium; he appeared like a mountain of
  anjana (black pigment), encircled by rain-clouds as they showered.
'3': >-
  As locusts swarm over a field of grain; as mosquitoes cover a mountain; as
  gadflies cluster about a jar of nectar; as sharks throng the ocean—
'4': >-
  so did the arrows, loosed from rākṣasa bows—swift as the wind, as hard as the
  thunderbolt, and rapid as thought—enter into Hari, as in an inversion of the
  world’s order (as though the very laws of nature were reversed).
'5': >-
  Some were mounted in chariots and fought from chariots; some, seated upon
  elephants, fought from elephant-backs; some were horsemen with horses; and
  foot-soldiers too, stationed in the sky (by their magic), pressed the attack.
'6': >-
  Those rākṣasa lords, huge as mountains, with arrows, spears, lances, and
  javelins, made Hari as it were bereft of breath—like men practicing
  breath-restraint (prāṇāyāma) upon a twice-born ascetic.
'7': >-
  Struck by the night-rangers like the great ocean battered by fishes, the
  irresistible One stretched forth Śārṅga (his bow) and released arrows against
  the rākṣasas.
'8': >-
  With keen shafts—fully drawn and powerfully discharged, thunderbolt-faced
  (deadly-pointed) and swift as thought—Viṣṇu severed them, hundreds and then
  thousands.
'9': >-
  Having scattered the storm of arrows, like the wind dispelling a mass of
  rain-clouds that has arisen, the Supreme Person blew his great conch,
  Pāñcajanya.
'10': >-
  Blown by Hari with his full life-breath, that lord of conches—born from the
  lotus-like deep—roared with a dreadful reverberation, as though shaking the
  three worlds.
'11': >-
  That roar of the king of conches terrified the rākṣasas, like a lion-king in
  the forest frightening rut-maddened elephants.
'12': >-
  The horses could not stand firm; the elephants lost their must (became
  unmaddened); and the warriors, enfeebled by the conch-roar, fell down from
  their chariots.
'13': >-
  Arrows released from the Śārṅga bow, their points like thunderbolts and
  furnished with excellent feathers, tore through those rākṣasas and entered the
  earth.
'14': >-
  Pierced in battle by arrows discharged from Nārāyaṇa’s own hand, the rākṣasas
  fell upon the ground like mountains struck by a thunderbolt.
'15': >-
  The wounds made on their bodies by Viṣṇu’s discus streamed blood in torrents,
  like golden waterfalls pouring from a mountain.
'16': >-
  The roar of the conch-king, the twang of the Śārṅga bow, and even the cries of
  the rākṣasas themselves—all these sounds were swallowed up by the Vaishnava
  (divine) thunder.
'17': >-
  He cut down with arrows their heads, their fluttering standards, and their
  bows; and likewise he shattered chariots, banners, and quivers.
'18': >-
  As dreadful rays come from the sun; as waves from the ocean; as lordly
  serpents from a mountain; and as torrents of rain from a cloud—
'19': >-
  so did the arrows, released from Śārṅga and impelled by Nārāyaṇa, rush forth
  swiftly, by hundreds and by thousands.
'20': >-
  As lions flee before the śarabha; as elephants flee before a lion; as tigers
  flee before an elephant; as leopards flee before a tiger—
'21': >-
  as dogs flee before a leopard; as cats flee before a dog; as serpents flee
  before a cat; and as mice flee before a serpent—
'22': >-
  so did all those rākṣasas flee from Viṣṇu, the mighty Lord; some ran in rout,
  and others lay stretched upon the earth.
'23': >-
  Having slain thousands of rākṣasas, Madhusūdana filled his lotus(-like
  presence/field), as the king of the gods fills a rain-cloud with water.
'24': >-
  The rākṣasa host, shattered—terrified by Nārāyaṇa’s arrows and bewildered by
  the conch’s blast—went facing toward Laṅkā in flight.
'25': >-
  When the rākṣasa army was broken and smitten by Nārāyaṇa’s shafts, Sumālī
  checked Hari in battle with a rain of arrows.
'26': >-
  He covered him, as mist covers the sun; and the rākṣasas, endowed with
  courage, took up their boldness once more.
'27': >-
  Then that rākṣasa, proud of his strength, rushed forward in wrath, raising a
  mighty cry, as though reviving the rākṣasas’ spirits.
'28': >-
  Lifting up his long ornament and shaking it like an elephant swinging its
  trunk, the rākṣasa roared in exultation like a thundercloud with lightning and
  rain.
'29': >-
  As Sumālī roared, Hari cut off his head with its blazing earrings; and the
  horses and charioteer of that rākṣasa went reeling in confusion.
'30': >-
  Driven about by those bewildered, whirling horses, Sumālī, lord of rākṣasas,
  reeled—like a man whose sense-horses (the senses) have gone astray and who is
  bereft of steadiness.
'31': >-
  Then, as mighty-armed Viṣṇu came swiftly upon the battlefield, and as Sumālī’s
  horses had been taken away, Viṣṇu advanced toward the chariot of Viṣṇu (his
  own war-car).
'32': >-
  And Māli, harnessed (ready), charged, grasping his bow with arrows. The arrows
  shot from Māli’s bow, adorned with pure gold, entered Hari as they struck—like
  the wheeled, leaf-winged missiles of Krāuñca (as though like birds darting
  into the Krāuñca mountain).
'33': >-
  Though assailed by thousands of arrows released by Māli, Viṣṇu did not tremble
  in that battle—like one who has conquered his senses and is unshaken by inner
  afflictions.
'34': >-
  Then the Blessed Lord, the sustainer of beings, making the bowstring resound,
  the destroyer of foes poured forth torrents of arrows against Māli.
'35': >-
  Those arrows, bright as thunderbolt and lightning, reaching Māli’s body, drank
  his blood, like serpents drinking nectar.
'36': >-
  Turning Māli away (driving him back), the bearer of conch, discus, and mace
  struck down Māli’s crown, his banner, his bow, and even his steeds.
'37': >-
  But Māli, the foremost of night-rangers, now chariotless, seized a mace and
  sprang forth with mace in hand, like a lion leaping from a mountain peak.
'38': >-
  With his mace he struck Garuḍa’s lord—Hari—upon the region of the forehead, as
  Yama might strike Rudra, or as Indra with his thunderbolt strikes a mountain.
'39': >-
  Sorely smitten by Māli’s mace, Garuḍa, afflicted with pain, turned the god
  (Hari) away from the battle-front (forced a momentary recoil).
'40': >-
  When the god was turned away by Māli, and by Garuḍa’s turning, a great uproar
  arose among the rākṣasas as they shouted aloud.
'41': >-
  Hearing that tumultuous roar of the shouting rākṣasas, Hari—the younger
  brother of the horse(-banner), i.e., the charioteer/ally following the divine
  mount—(became intent once more on the fight).
'42': >-
  Standing somewhat aside, the Blessed Hari, lord of birds, enraged, though
  turned away, hurled his discus at Māli with the intent to slay.
'43': >-
  That discus, shining like the orb of the sun and lighting up the sky with its
  own splendor, resembling the wheel of Time, struck off Māli’s head.
'44': >-
  That head of the rākṣasa king, cut off by the discus—horrible to behold—fell
  spewing blood, like the severed head of Rāhu of old.
'45': >-
  Then, with the gods exceedingly rejoicing, there rose, driven forth with full
  breath, a lion-like shout, accompanied by cries of “Well done!” and “Victory
  to the Deva!”
'46': >-
  Seeing Māli slain, Sumālī and Mālyavān also—both with their forces—burning
  with grief, fled straight to Laṅkā.
'47': >-
  Garuḍa, having regained his composure and returning as before, angrily drove
  the rākṣasas away with the blast of his wings.
'48': >-
  With faces cut by the discus, chests crushed by the mace, necks seized and
  dragged as by a plough, and heads split by clubs—
'49': >-
  some were cut down by swords, others tormented by arrows; the rākṣasas fell
  swiftly from the sky into the waters of the ocean.
'50': >-
  Nārāyaṇa, with clusters of arrows released from his bow, tore apart the
  night-rangers, their hair loosened and tossed about—just as great rain-clouds
  with lightning are split by thunderbolts.
'51': >-
  Their umbrellas shattered, their weapons falling, their disciplined array
  broken and their ordered guise destroyed; their entrails spilling forth and
  their eyes trembling with fear—thus that host became yet more frenzied and
  ungoverned.
'52': >-
  Like elephants and night-rangers together—elephants attacked by lions—their
  cries and their impetuous rush became alike, as of those crushed by an ancient
  lion.
'53': >-
  Being checked by Hari’s nets of arrows, yet hurling forth their own nets of
  arrows, those night-ranging storm-clouds ran—like storm-clouds driven apart by
  the wind.
'54': >-
  With heads severed by strokes of the discus, limbs pulverized by blows of the
  mace, and split in two by repeated assaults, the rākṣasa lords fell like
  mountains.
'55': >-
  Those night-rangers, hanging down with jewel-necklaces and earrings, dark as
  blue rain-clouds, falling again and again, were seen continuously—like blue
  mountains collapsing.
'56': >-
  Thus ends the seventh canto, named “The Slaying of Māli,” in the Uttarakāṇḍa
  of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
