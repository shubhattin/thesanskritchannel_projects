'0': >-
  Now begins the first canto, entitled “The Leaping Over the Ocean,” in the
  auspicious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa.
'1': >-
  Thereupon Hanumān, the subduer of enemies, desired to seek out the whereabouts
  of Sītā who had been carried away by Rāvaṇa, setting forth upon the path that
  is trodden by the Cāraṇas.
'2': >-
  Wishing to accomplish a deed that was difficult and without an equal, the
  monkey appeared with lofty head and neck, like a lordly bull among the herds.
'3': >-
  Then the mighty, steadfast hero moved about at ease on emerald-hued grassy
  slopes, amid waters that seemed like the very ocean.
'4': >-
  Frightening the birds, uprooting trees with his breast, and slaying very many
  deer—he looked like a lion grown great.
'5': >-
  It was adorned with naturally formed, spotless ores—blue, red, madder,
  lotus-hued, white and black—shining in their own purity.
'6': >-
  It was continually thronged, together with their attendants and retinues, by
  shape-shifting beings—Yakṣas, Kinnaras, Gandharvas, godlike in form, and
  serpents as well.
'7': >-
  Standing on the ground at the foot of that best of mountains, frequented by
  noble serpents, the foremost of monkeys looked like a serpent by a lake.
'8': >-
  Having offered reverent salutations with joined palms to the Sun, to Mahendra,
  to the Wind, to the Self-born Brahmā, and to all beings, he resolved upon his
  departure.
'9': >-
  Facing east with joined palms, he made obeisance to the Wind, the self-born
  Lord; and then he grew eager to go southward, toward the southern quarter.
'10': >-
  Seen by the foremost of monkeys to have firmly resolved upon the leap, he grew
  in stature for Rāma’s prosperity—like the ocean swelling at the full moon.
'11': >-
  Assuming a body beyond measure, intent on overleaping the sea, he pressed the
  mountain with his arms and also with his feet.
'12': >-
  The mountain, thus pressed by the monkey, quickly quivered for a moment, and
  all the blossoms from the flowering treetops were shaken down.
'13': >-
  By that fragrant flood of blossoms released from the trees, the mountain was
  covered on all sides, as though it were made wholly of flowers.
'14': >-
  Pressed by that hero of supreme vigor, the mountain began to stream with
  water, like an intoxicated elephant oozing with rut.
'15': >-
  But Mahendra mountain, pressed by the mighty one, brought forth streaks of
  golden, black collyrium-like, and silvery veins.
'16': >-
  The mountain loosed huge rocks of even stone; and, lit by a middling flame of
  splendor, it appeared like a fire with lines of smoke.
'17': >-
  As the monkey pressed, creatures hidden in caves and fissures, oppressed on
  every side, cried out in distorted voices.
'18': >-
  That great uproar of living beings, caused by the pressure on the mountain,
  filled the earth, the quarters, and the groves.
'19': >-
  Serpents, with broad hoods marked with distinct auspicious emblems, spewed
  forth dreadful fire and bit the rocks with their fangs.
'20': >-
  Then those great rocks, bitten with poison by the enraged serpents, flared up,
  kindled by fire, and split into a thousand pieces.
'21': >-
  Even the various medicinal herbs that grew upon that mountain—though antidotes
  to serpent-venom—could not calm the poison of the nāgas.
'22': >-
  Thinking, “This mountain is being shattered by beings,” the ascetics and the
  Vidyādharas, terrified, sprang up from there along with their companies of
  women.
'23': >-
  Leaving behind on the drinking-ground their golden vessels of liquor, and
  their most precious cups and golden ewers,
'24': >-
  Their various licks and foods, diverse meats, bull-hides, swords and golden
  arrows,
'25': >-
  Intoxicated, their necklaces displaced, wearing red garlands and unguents,
  with reddened eyes and lotus-like eyes, they took to the sky.
'26': >-
  Women wearing necklaces, anklets, armlets, and fine garments—astonished and
  smiling—stood in the air with their lovers.
'27': >-
  Vidyādhara great seers, displaying their mighty lore, remained together in the
  sky and watched the mountain.
'28': >-
  And then there was heard the speech of sages of accomplished souls, and of
  Cāraṇas and Siddhas who stood in the pure firmament.
'29': >-
  “This is Hanumān, son of Māruta, vast as a mountain; of great speed, he seeks
  to cross the ocean—the abode of Varuṇa.”
'30': >-
  “For Rāma’s sake and for the monkeys’ sake, wishing to accomplish a most
  difficult deed, he desires to reach the far shore of the ocean, hard to
  attain.”
'31': >-
  Hearing these words of the Vidyādharas, spoken among those ascetics, they
  beheld upon the mountain the immeasurable bull among monkeys.
'32': >-
  He shook his hair and trembled like fire, and he uttered a great roar, like a
  mighty rain-cloud.
'33': >-
  And in proper sequence he swung his tail, covered with hair, as he prepared to
  leap—like the king of birds flinging a serpent.
'34': >-
  His tail, whirled behind him by his great speed, looked like a huge serpent
  being borne away by Garuḍa.
'35': >-
  He braced his arms, like massive iron bars; the monkey drew his feet to his
  waist and coiled them close.
'36': >-
  Gathering in his arms and also his neck, that powerful one entered into
  concentrated splendor, spirit, and valor.
'37': >-
  Gazing far along the route with eyes fixed upward, he held his breath within
  his heart while looking into the sky.
'38': >-
  Planting his feet firmly, that elephant among monkeys, the mighty Hanumān,
  drew in his ears, ready to leap.
'39': 'The best of monkeys spoke these words to the monkeys, in this manner:'
'40': >-
  “As the arrow released by Rāghava, swift as the wind, would go—so shall I go
  to Laṅkā guarded by Rāvaṇa; for I will not look upon the daughter of Janaka in
  Laṅkā without finding her.”
'41': >-
  “With this very speed I could even reach the abode of the gods; yet if I do
  not see Sītā in the triple heaven as well, I shall not count my toil as
  fulfilled.”
'42': >-
  “I will bind the king of rākṣasas and bring Rāvaṇa; in every way having
  accomplished my purpose, I shall return together with Sītā.”
'43': >-
  “Or else I shall bring Laṅkā itself, tearing it up together with Rāvaṇa!”
  Having spoken thus, Hanumān—the foremost among monkeys—
'44': >-
  Leapt forth with speed, swift and without hesitation; that elephant among
  monkeys deemed himself like Garuḍa.
'45': >-
  As he sprang up with force, those mountains and trees around—having gathered
  up all their branches—rose up all about him.
'46': >-
  Bearing away flowering trees laden with blossoms and wild bees, he went
  through the stainless sky with tremendous speed.
'47': >-
  Trees uprooted by the force of his thighs followed the monkey for a moment,
  like kinsmen following a dear relation setting out on a long journey.
'48': >-
  Śāla trees and other excellent trees, torn up by the force of his thighs,
  followed after Hanumān like an army following its king.
'49': >-
  Accompanied by many trees with flower-laden tops, Hanumān, mountain-shaped,
  appeared wondrous to behold.
'50': >-
  Then those trees, full of sap, sank into the salt waters—like mountains
  sinking into Varuṇa’s abode from fear of Mahendra.
'51': >-
  Strewn with many kinds of blossoms, buds and tender shoots, the
  monkey—cloud-like—shone, like a mountain lit by swarms of fireflies.
'52': >-
  Released by his speed, those trees let go their flowers and, falling apart
  into the water, sank back like friends turning back.
'53': >-
  Through lightness it fell in variegated fashion into the sea—the diverse
  flowers of the trees, stirred by the wind of the monkey; and the great ocean
  shone like the sky studded with stars.
'54': >-
  With a fragrant flood of many-colored blossoms, the monkey looked like a
  rising cloud adorned with clusters of lightning.
'55': >-
  By the blossoms thrown up by his speed, the water itself became unseen, like
  the sky obscured by stars—or by fair women risen aloft.
'56': >-
  His arms, stretched out in the sky as he moved, were seen as though they were
  five-hooded serpents emerging from a mountain peak.
'57': >-
  As though drinking up the ocean’s net of waves, that great monkey appeared;
  and like one thirsty, he seemed to gaze upon the sky.
'58': >-
  His eyes, following the path of the wind, shone with lightning-like radiance,
  like fires upon a mountain.
'59': >-
  The two great, round eyes of that tawny, tawny-eyed chief shone like the moon
  and the sun set side by side.
'60': >-
  His face, with its coppery nose, looked copper-red, like the orb of the sun
  touched by twilight.
'61': >-
  And the tail, whirled as he flew, shone in the sky of the Wind-god’s son like
  Indra’s banner raised aloft.
'62': >-
  Hanumān, with tail circling, white-tusked, son of the Wind, the supremely
  wise, blazed forth like the sun ringed with a halo.
'63': >-
  That great monkey shone with his exceedingly coppery haunches, like a great
  mountain split open with red mineral.
'64': >-
  For that lion among monkeys, as he leapt over the ocean, the wind within his
  armpits roared like a thundercloud.
'65': >-
  As a meteor, released from the northern end of heaven, is seen falling with a
  trailing line—so was that elephant among monkeys seen.
'66': >-
  Resembling a falling meteor and stretched out, the monkey shone, like a huge
  elephant held by a girth at the flanks.
'67': >-
  With his body above and his deep shadow below, that monkey, filled with wind,
  was then like a boat upon the sea.
'68': >-
  Whatever part of the ocean the great monkey traversed, that portion, by the
  speed of his limbs, seemed as though it were maddened.
'69': >-
  Striking with his chest the great mountain-like masses of waves, that mighty
  one bounded on with tremendous speed.
'70': >-
  The powerful wind of the monkey and the wind of the clouds, bursting forth,
  greatly shook the ocean with its dreadful roar.
'71': >-
  Dragging along the great nets of waves in the salt water, the tiger among
  monkeys leapt, as though scattering the two worlds.
'72': >-
  With great speed he overstepped the waves risen in the vast ocean, like Meru
  and Mandara, as if counting them.
'73': >-
  The water, made to resound by his speed, and mingled with cloud-water, shone
  in the sky like an expanse of autumn clouds.
'74': >-
  Whales, makaras, fishes, and tortoises were seen with their bodies laid open,
  as though the garments of living beings had been pulled away.
'75': >-
  Seeing him advancing, the serpents that move in the ocean thought that tiger
  among monkeys in the sky to be like Garuḍa.
'76': >-
  The shadow of that lion among monkeys—ten yojanas wide and thirty yojanas
  long—became even more beautiful in his speed.
'77': >-
  That shadow, following the Wind-god’s son like a mass of white clouds, fell
  upon the salt waters and shone splendidly.
'78': >-
  That mighty, great-bodied, great monkey shone in the wind-path,
  unsupported—like a winged mountain.
'79': >-
  By the very path along which that powerful elephant among monkeys went with
  speed, the ocean suddenly seemed as though it were made into a trough.
'80': >-
  Moving within the range of flocks of birds like the king of birds, Hanumān
  dragged along masses of clouds like the wind itself.
'81': >-
  Pale, reddish, blue, and madder-hued great clouds, drawn along by the monkey,
  glittered.
'82': >-
  Entering cloud-banks and emerging again and again, now hidden and now
  revealed, he appeared like the moon.
'83': >-
  Seeing that swift-flying monkey as he leapt, the devas, gandharvas, and
  cāraṇas rained down flowers there.
'84': >-
  The sun did not scorch that monkey lord as he flew; and the wind served him
  then for the accomplishment of Rāma’s purpose.
'85': >-
  Sages praised him as he flew through the sky; and devas and gandharvas sang,
  extolling the forest-dweller.
'86': >-
  Nāgas, yakṣas, and various rākṣasas too praised him—beholding at once the
  foremost monkey, free of fatigue.
'87': >-
  While that tiger among monkeys, Hanumān, was leaping, the ocean—the abode of
  the Ikṣvāku line’s honor—began to ponder.
'88': >-
  “If I do not render aid to Hanumān, the lord of monkeys, I shall become spoken
  of by all who wish to censure.”
'89': >-
  “I was enlarged by King Sagara, lord of the Ikṣvākus; and this one is a
  minister of the Ikṣvākus—therefore it is not right that he should be brought
  to distress.”
'90': >-
  “I must contrive so that the monkey may rest; and resting upon me, he shall
  happily cross the remainder.”
'91': >-
  Having thus formed a noble resolve, the ocean, hidden beneath the waters,
  addressed Maināka, the best of mountains, whose summit was of gold.
'92': >-
  “You were stationed here by the great Devarāja, as a barrier against the hosts
  of asuras dwelling in the netherworld.”
'93': >-
  “For these, of known valor, who would again take flight, you stand covering
  the gate of the immeasurable Pātāla.”
'94': >-
  “O mountain, your power to grow extends sideways, upward, and downward;
  therefore I urge you—rise up, best of mountains!”
'95': >-
  “This tiger among monkeys, the mighty Hanumān—seeking to serve Rāma, dreadful
  in action—comes over you, coursing through the sky.”
'96': >-
  “Aid must be rendered by me to this one who abides in the Ikṣvāku line; the
  Ikṣvākus are venerable to me, and to you they are supremely venerable.”
'97': >-
  “Do this service for us, so that our purpose may not be thwarted; a task left
  undone, though it should be done, stirs the wrath of the good.”
'98': >-
  “Rise up above the waters; let this monkey stand upon you—he is our guest and
  worthy of honor, the best of those who leap.”
'99': >-
  “O Maināka of vast golden navel, frequented by devas and gandharvas—Hanumān,
  resting on you, shall then go the remaining way.”
'100': >-
  “Considering the compassion of the son of Kakutstha and the exile of Maithilī,
  and also the fatigue of the lord among monkeys—you should rise.”
'101': >-
  Hearing the command of the salt ocean, Maināka, like Hiraṇyagarbha, sprang
  quickly out of the water, covered with great trees and creepers.
'102': >-
  Breaking through the ocean-water, he then rose exceedingly high, as the sun
  with blazing rays breaks through a cloud.
'103': >-
  In a moment that great-souled mountain, covered by the waters, displayed his
  peaks—set in motion by the ocean.
'104': >-
  With peaks of pure gold, with kinnaras and mighty serpents upon them, shining
  like sunrise, as though scratching the sky,
'105': >-
  By those peaks of the mountain that rose, made of Jāmbūnada gold, the sky took
  on a weapon-like gleam, with the luster of gold.
'106': >-
  With brilliant peaks of burnished gold, of great radiance, that best of
  mountains became like a hundred suns.
'107': >-
  Seeing it risen suddenly and standing before him in the midst of the salt
  waters, Hanumān decided, “This is an obstacle.”
'108': >-
  That great monkey of tremendous speed struck down that exceedingly lofty
  mountain with his chest, like the wind hurling down a cloud.
'109': >-
  But the best of mountains, thus met by the monkey, understanding the speed of
  the hero, rejoiced and roared.
'110': >-
  Approaching the hero who was in the sky, the mountain, pleased and glad at
  heart, spoke these words to the monkey.
'111': >-
  Assuming a human form and standing upon his own summit, he said: “You have
  performed this difficult deed, O foremost of monkeys.”
'112': >-
  “Alight upon my peaks; rest comfortably and then go on. The ocean was
  increased by those born in Rāghava’s line.”
'113': >-
  “The ocean honors you who are engaged in Rāma’s welfare; and when one has been
  helped, one should render help in return—this is the eternal dharma.”
'114': >-
  “Thus, seeking to repay that good deed, he deserves respect from you. For your
  sake I have been urged to this out of great regard.”
'115': >-
  “This monkey has leapt a hundred yojanas through the sky; resting upon your
  slopes, let him proceed the rest.”
'116': >-
  “Stay, O tiger among monkeys; rest upon me and then go. Here are many
  fragrant, sweet roots, tubers, and fruits.”
'117': >-
  “Having tasted them, O best of monkeys, and rested, you shall then go. And
  between us too, O chief of monkeys, there is indeed a bond—renowned in the
  three worlds, founded on great virtues.”
'118': >-
  “Of all swift-leaping monkeys, O son of the Wind, I deem you the foremost, O
  mighty elephant among monkeys.”
'119': >-
  “A guest, even if ordinary, is worthy of honor to one who knows; how much more
  one such as you, who seeks to know dharma?”
'120': >-
  “For you are the son of the most excellent of gods, the great-souled Māruta,
  and equal to him in speed, O elephant among monkeys.”
'121': >-
  “When you, knower of dharma, are honored, Māruta receives honor; therefore you
  are worthy of worship by me. And hear also the reason for this.”
'122': >-
  “Formerly, in the Kṛta age, mountains had wings; and they went in all
  directions, swift like Garuḍas.”
'123': >-
  “Then, as they moved about, the hosts of gods along with ṛṣis, and living
  beings too, were seized by fear, suspecting their falling.”
'124': >-
  “Thereupon Indra of the thousand eyes, Śatakratu, enraged, cut off the wings
  of the mountains with his thunderbolt—by hundreds of thousands.”
'125': >-
  “He came against me in anger, the lord of gods, raising the thunderbolt; then
  I was suddenly hurled by the breath of the great-souled one (your father).”
'126': >-
  “Cast into this salt water, O best of monkeys, my wings were hidden yet I
  remained whole, protected by your father.”
'127': >-
  “Therefore I honor you; you are worthy of honor to me, O son of Māruta.
  Through you I have this bond, O chief of monkeys, rich in great merit.”
'128': >-
  “In this undertaking that has come to pass—for the ocean and for me—you
  should, O great-minded one, grant gladness with a glad heart.”
'129': >-
  “Set aside your fatigue; accept my hospitality, O best of monkeys. And accept
  also my goodwill, for I am pleased at your sight.”
'130': >-
  Thus addressed, the best of monkeys replied to that excellent mountain: “I am
  pleased; your hospitality is done. Let any displeasure be removed.”
'131': >-
  “My time for action hastens, and the day too passes on; and a pledge has been
  given by me—I must not halt here in between.”
'132': >-
  So saying, touching the mountain with his hand, the foremost of monkeys
  entered the sky, that heroic one seeming to smile.
'133': >-
  He was looked upon with honor by the mountain and the ocean, and worshiped and
  gladdened by fitting blessings.
'134': >-
  Then, having gone far upward and leaving behind the mountain and the great
  ocean, he reached his father’s path and went on through the stainless sky.
'135': >-
  Again gaining higher motion, looking back at that mountain, the son of the
  Wind—unsupported—went on, that elephant among monkeys.
'136': >-
  Seeing this second most difficult deed of Hanumān, all the gods and the
  Siddhas and supreme ṛṣis praised him.
'137': >-
  The deities present there were delighted by his deed, and so too Vāsava, Indra
  of the thousand eyes, along with the golden, well-naveled one (Maināka).
'138': >-
  The wise Lord of Śacī, Indra himself, spoke to the best of mountains, Sunābha,
  in stammering words of joy.
'139': >-
  “O Hiraṇyanābha, lord of mountains, I am exceedingly pleased with you; I grant
  you fearlessness—go, gentle one, at your ease.”
'140': >-
  “Great aid has been rendered by you to Hanumān as he rested—at the
  hundred-yojana measure, without fear though fear was present.”
'141': >-
  “This monkey goes indeed for the welfare of Rāma, the son of Daśaratha. By
  honoring him with what power you had, you have firmly pleased me.”
'142': >-
  That best of mountains gained vast delight on seeing the lord of the gods,
  Śatakratu, satisfied.
'143': >-
  That mountain, thus granted a boon, then remained established; and Hanumān
  within a moment traversed the ocean.
'144': >-
  Then the gods, with gandharvas, and the Siddhas and supreme seers, spoke to
  Surasā, radiant as the sun, the mother of serpents.
'145': >-
  “This illustrious son of the Wind is leaping over the sea; his name is
  Hanumān—do for him for a moment an obstruction.”
'146': >-
  “Assume a rākṣasa form—very dreadful, mountain-like—terrible with fangs,
  tawny-eyed, making your mouth touch the sky.”
'147': >-
  “We wish to know his strength and again his prowess—whether he will overcome
  you by some means, or fall into dejection.”
'148': >-
  Thus addressed, that goddess, duly honored by the deities, stood in the midst
  of the ocean bearing a rākṣasa body.
'149': >-
  Deformed and hideous and terrifying to all, she enveloped Hanumān as he flew
  and spoke these words.
'150': >-
  “You are ordained as my food by the lords, O bull among monkeys. I shall eat
  you—enter into my mouth.”
'151': >-
  “This boon was once given to me by the Creator.” Thus speaking quickly, she
  stood before the son of the Wind, opening wide her enormous mouth.
'152': >-
  Thus spoken to by Surasā, he replied with a delighted face: “Rāma, the son of
  Daśaratha, entered the Daṇḍaka forest with his brother Lakṣmaṇa and with
  Vaidehī also as his wife.”
'153': >-
  “While he was engaged in other tasks, and while rākṣasas bound by enmity
  opposed him, his illustrious wife Sītā was carried off by Rāvaṇa.”
'154': >-
  “I am his messenger; by Rāma’s command I am going to her. You should render
  aid to Rāma, O dweller in the region (of the sea).”
'155': >-
  “Or else, having seen Maithilī and Rāma, the unwearied doer of deeds, I shall
  return and enter your mouth—I promise you truly.”
'156': >-
  Thus spoken to by Hanumān, Surasā, who could assume forms at will, said: “None
  may pass beyond me—such is my boon.”
'157': >-
  Watching him as he went on, Surasā spoke—she who, as the serpent-mother,
  sought to test the strength of Hanumān.
'158': >-
  “Enter my mouth today, O foremost of monkeys; then you may go. This boon was
  formerly granted to me by the Creator.”
'159': >-
  Opening her vast mouth, she stood before the son of the Wind. Thus addressed
  by Surasā, the monkey bull grew wrathful.
'160': >-
  He said: “Then make your mouth such that you may be able to endure me!” Having
  spoken thus, angry at Surasā, he became ten yojanas in length.
'161': >-
  Hanumān then became ten yojanas in breadth. Seeing him cloud-like, ten yojanas
  long, Surasā made her mouth twenty yojanas long.
'162': >-
  Then Hanumān, enraged, became thirty yojanas long; Surasā made her mouth forty
  yojanas, rising accordingly.
'163': >-
  The heroic Hanumān became fifty yojanas in height; Surasā made her mouth sixty
  yojanas in height.
'164': >-
  At once the heroic Hanumān became seventy yojanas in height; Surasā made her
  mouth eighty yojanas in height.
'165': >-
  Hanumān, like blazing fire, became ninety yojanas in height; Surasā made her
  mouth a full hundred yojanas in length.
'166': >-
  Seeing that gaping mouth—long-tongued, exceedingly dreadful, like a hell—of
  Surasā, the wise son of the Wind beheld it clearly.
'167': >-
  Then Maruti, shrinking his body like a cloud compressed by wind, in that very
  moment became the size of a thumb.
'168': >-
  Entering that mouth and immediately leaping out again, that mighty one stood
  in midair and spoke these words.
'169': >-
  “I have entered your mouth, O Dākṣāyaṇī—salutations to you. I shall go where
  Vaidehī is; and your boon has indeed been fulfilled.”
'170': >-
  Seeing him released from her mouth like the moon freed from Rāhu’s jaws, the
  goddess Surasā spoke to the monkey in her own form.
'171': >-
  “Go, O best of monkeys, to accomplish your purpose; go, gentle one, at your
  ease—and bring back Vaidehī to the great-souled Rāghava.”
'172': >-
  Seeing this third most difficult deed of Hanumān, the beings then praised the
  monkey, saying, “Well done, well done!”
'173': >-
  Approaching the unassailable ocean, Varuṇa’s abode, he went on entering the
  sky with speed, like Garuḍa.
'174': >-
  Through regions served by streams of rain, frequented by birds, traversed by
  masters of music and rhythm, and visited by Airāvata,
'175': >-
  Adorned with spotless aerial chariots moving about, borne by lions, elephants,
  tigers, birds, serpents, and horses,
'176': >-
  Beautiful as though touched by thunderbolts and meteors, gleaming like fire,
  inhabited by blessed beings of merit who have conquered heaven,
'177': >-
  Bearing offerings to the gods, attended by Citrabhānu (Agni), and adorned with
  planets, lunar mansions, moon, sun, and hosts of stars,
'178': >-
  Filled with assemblies of great ṛṣis, gandharvas, nāgas, and yakṣas—vast,
  pure, and distinct—frequented by Viśvāvasu,
'179': >-
  Trodden by the celestial elephant of the lord of gods, auspicious on the path
  of the moon and sun—an awning of the living world, spread out, fashioned by
  Brahmā,
'180': >-
  Often resorted to by heroes and thronged with bands of Vidyādharas—along that
  wind-path he went, like Garuḍa, the son of the Wind.
'181': >-
  Hanumān dragged along masses of clouds like the wind itself—dark as black
  aloe-wood, and red, yellow, and white.
'182': >-
  Great clouds drawn by the monkey glittered; entering cloud-banks and emerging
  again and again,
'183': >-
  He appeared like the moon in the rainy season—now emerging, now
  entering—visible everywhere, Hanumān the son of the Wind.
'184': >-
  He took to the unsupported firmament like a winged lord of mountains. Seeing
  him leaping, a rākṣasī named Siṃhikā,
'185': >-
  Matured and able to assume forms at will, thought in her mind: “Today, after a
  long time, I shall be satisfied.”
'186': >-
  “This great creature has at last come into my power.” Thus reflecting, she
  seized his shadow with her mind.
'187': >-
  When his shadow was seized, the monkey pondered: “I have been suddenly caught,
  my prowess made lame.”
'188': >-
  Like a great ship on the sea under a contrary wind, the monkey then looked
  sideways, upward, and downward.
'189': >-
  He saw a mighty being risen in the salt waters. Seeing it, Maruti considered
  that misshapen-faced one.
'190': >-
  “As was told by the king of monkeys, this is that wondrous being,
  shadow-seizing, of great might—there is no doubt.”
'191': >-
  Knowing her truly to be Siṃhikā, the intelligent monkey expanded into a vast
  body like a monsoon cloud.
'192': >-
  Seeing the body of the great monkey growing, she spread her mouth, like the
  sky of the netherworld.
'193': >-
  Roaring like a dense mass of clouds, she rushed at the monkey; then he saw her
  huge, misshapen mouth.
'194': >-
  The wise great monkey marked her body’s measure and her vital points; and that
  monkey, hard as thunderbolt in frame, in her monstrous mouth,
'195': >-
  Shrank himself again and again and then plunged down. The Siddhas and Cāraṇas
  saw the great monkey sinking into her mouth,
'196': >-
  Like the full moon at the time of the full-moon day being swallowed by Rāhu.
  Then, with his sharp nails, the monkey tore out her vital parts.
'197': >-
  Then he sprang up with speed, with the prowess of the mind’s flight; and by
  destiny, steadfastness, and skill he struck her down.
'198': >-
  The heroic monkey, self-possessed, grew again with speed. Siṃhikā, her heart
  torn away by Hanumān, fell helpless into the waters. Hanumān had been created
  by the Self-born Brahmā for the very purpose of slaying her.
'199': >-
  Seeing Siṃhikā slain and fallen swiftly by the monkey, the sky-roaming beings
  said to that foremost of leapers:
'200': >-
  “Today you have done a dreadful deed: a mighty being has been slain by you.
  Accomplish the purpose you have undertaken, O best of those who leap, without
  misfortune.”
'201': >-
  “He who possesses these four, O lord of monkeys, as you do—steadfastness,
  sight, intelligence, and skill—does not fail in actions.”
'202': >-
  Honored by them—he, the worthy one—his purpose secured, the monkey entered the
  sky and went on like the eater of serpents (Garuḍa).
'203': >-
  Having reached the farthest part of his crossing, he looked about on all
  sides; and at the end of a hundred yojanas he saw a line of forest.
'204': >-
  And as he flew he saw an island adorned with diverse trees, and the groves of
  Malaya mountain.
'205': >-
  He beheld the sea, the shores of the sea, the trees born on the sea-shores,
  and even the faces of the wives of the ocean-ruler (the river-mouths that
  enter the sea).
'206': >-
  Seeing himself like a great cloud, as though obstructing the sky, the
  self-possessed one formed a deliberate resolve.
'207': >-
  “Seeing my increase of body and speed, the rākṣasas might become curious about
  me,” thus thought that great-minded one.
'208': >-
  Then shrinking his body, which had been like a mountain, he returned to his
  natural size—like one free from delusion.
'209': >-
  Having greatly reduced that form and standing in his natural state,
  Hanumān—like Viṣṇu taking three strides, the taker of Bali’s valor—advanced.
'210': >-
  And that bearer of many wondrous forms, having reached the far shore of the
  ocean—assuming a form not to be attained by others—self-possessed, and having
  well considered his aim, contemplated the purpose before him.
'211': >-
  Then that great-souled one, resembling a huge cloud-mass, alighted upon a peak
  of the prosperous Laṅkā mountain—on a variegated summit, amid ketaka,
  uddālaka, and coconut trees.
'212': >-
  Then, having reached the sea-shore and surveying Laṅkā upon the crown of the
  best of mountains, the monkey descended upon that mountain, shaking off his
  form and troubling the deer and birds.
'213': >-
  Having crossed by strength that ocean filled with hosts of dānavas and
  serpents, garlanded with mighty waves, and having alighted then upon the shore
  of the great sea, he beheld Laṅkā, like Amarāvatī itself.
'214': >-
  Thus ends the first canto, entitled “The Leaping Over the Ocean,” in the
  ancient, auspicious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, within the Sundara-kāṇḍa.
