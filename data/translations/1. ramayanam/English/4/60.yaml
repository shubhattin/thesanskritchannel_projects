  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the sixtieth
  chapter, called “The narration of Sampāti’s former history.”

  Thereafter, having performed the rite of water and bathed, the leaders of the
  monkey-hosts sat down around that vulture on a delightful mountain, encircling
  him on every side.
'2': >-
  Seeing Aṅgada seated near him and surrounded by all those monkeys, Sampāti—his
  confidence restored—again spoke, rejoicing in his heart.
'3': >-
  “Let the monkeys listen to me in silence, with minds fixed and attentive. I
  shall relate the truth, as I know it, concerning Maithilī.”
'4': >-
  “Formerly, O sinless one, I fell upon the summit of this Vindhya. My limbs
  were seized by the sun’s heat, scorched by the rays of the Sun.”
'5': >-
  “Regaining consciousness only after six nights, helpless and as though
  bewildered, looking toward all the quarters, I could understand nothing at
  all.”
'6': >-
  “Then, after beholding the oceans and mountains, all the rivers and lakes, the
  forests and the tracts of land, my understanding gradually returned.”
'7': >-
  “Abounding in joyous flocks of birds, full of caves, hollows, and peaks—this
  indeed was resolved to be the Vindhya, upon the shore of the southern sea.”
'8': >-
  “Here too there was a sacred hermitage, honored even by the gods, in which
  dwelt an ascetic of fierce austerities named Niśākara.”
'9': >-
  “For eight thousand years I lived on this mountain with that righteous sage;
  and then Niśākara went to heaven.”
'10': >-
  “Descending from the crest of the Vindhya with difficulty, slowly from that
  rugged place, I came again—suffering greatly—onto the earth, bristling with
  sharp darbha grass.”
'11': >-
  “Desiring to see that sage, I had come, afflicted exceedingly with sorrow; for
  he had been well known to me many times, and to Jatāyus as well.”
'12': >-
  “Near the precincts of his hermitage, fragrant breezes blew. No tree was to be
  seen that was without blossoms, or without fruit.”
'13': >-
  “Approaching that sacred hermitage and taking refuge at the root of a tree,
  desiring to see him, I waited there for the venerable Niśākara.”
'14': >-
  “Then I beheld, at a distance, the sage of blazing splendor—having performed
  his ablutions, unassailable—returning, facing north.”
'15': >-
  “Bears, deer, tigers, lions, and many kinds of creeping creatures surrounded
  him and approached him, as living beings approach a giver.”
'16': >-
  “Then, knowing that the sage had arrived, those creatures withdrew—like all
  the force with its ministers departing when the king has entered within.”
'17': >-
  “The sage, seeing me, was pleased and entered the hermitage again. After only
  a brief moment, he came out and then asked me my purpose.”
'18': >-
  “‘Gentle one, seeing the mutilation of your feathers, it is not understood.
  These two wings seem burnt by fire—and life too remains within your body.’”
'19': >-
  “‘You are the elder—Sampāti; Jatāyu is your younger brother. Assuming a human
  form, take hold of my feet.’”
'20': >-
  “‘From what illness has your affliction arisen? How did your wings fall away?
  By whom has this punishment been inflicted? Tell me everything, as I ask
  you.’”
'21': >-
  Thus ends the sixtieth chapter in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The narration of Sampāti’s former
  history.”
