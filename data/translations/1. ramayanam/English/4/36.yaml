  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  thirty-sixth sarga, called “The Conciliation of Sugrīva and Lakṣmaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by Tārā with words spoken in humility and in harmony with
  dharma, Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa)—gentle by nature—accepted her speech.
'2': >-
  When that speech had been received, Sugrīva, lord of the hosts of monkeys,
  cast away from himself the exceedingly great fear of Lakṣmaṇa, as though he
  had thrown off a garment drenched with wetness.
'3': >-
  Then Sugrīva, lord of the vānaras, cut off the splendid garland that hung upon
  his neck—variegated, great, and richly adorned with many qualities—and he
  became free from pride.
'4': >-
  That best of all monkeys, Sugrīva, with delight, spoke to Lakṣmaṇa of dreadful
  might with humble and courteous words, gladdening him.
'5': >-
  “My fortune and my fame, and this enduring sovereignty of the
  monkey-kingdom—these were lost; yet, O Saumitri, by Rāma’s grace, this has
  been regained by me once more.
'6': >-
  Who, O prince, could ever repay—even in some small fraction—unto that divine
  one, renowned by his own deeds, any deed such as his?
'7': >-
  Rāghava, by his own splendor, will recover Sītā and will slay Rāvaṇa—he, the
  righteous-souled—having only me as a mere helper.
'8': >-
  What need has he of help—he who with a single arrow split asunder seven mighty
  trees, and the mountain, and even the earth itself?
'9': >-
  And he whose bow, when drawn, sends forth a sound by which the earth, together
  with its mountains, is made to quake—what indeed is the use of helpers to such
  a one, O Lakṣmaṇa?
'10': >-
  Yet I, O bull among men, shall accompany the king as he goes forth to slay
  Rāvaṇa, the enemy, together with his city and his retinue.
'11': >-
  If anything has been transgressed by me—whether through trustfulness or
  through affection—then, since I am as one appointed to serve, it should be
  forgiven; for no one is without some fault.
'12': >-
  While that great-souled Sugrīva was speaking thus, Lakṣmaṇa became pleased;
  and, out of affection, he spoke these words.
'13': >-
  “In every way my brother has protection, O lord of monkeys—through you as his
  protector, O Sugrīva, especially since you are humble and well-disposed.
'14': >-
  Such as is your power, Sugrīva, and such is this purity of conduct of
  yours—truly you are worthy to enjoy the unsurpassed prosperity of the
  monkey-kingdom.
'15': >-
  And with you as his ally, O Sugrīva, the mighty Rāma will slay in battle the
  enemies that range at will—of this there is no doubt.
'16': >-
  For one who knows dharma, who is grateful, who does not turn back in
  battles—your words, O Sugrīva, are fitting, proper, and well-reasoned.
'17': >-
  Who else, being capable and discerning of faults, is worthy to speak
  so—setting aside my elder brother and you, O best of vānaras?
'18': >-
  You are equal to Rāma in valor and in strength, O foremost of monkeys; as an
  ally you have been granted by the gods after long time.
'19': >-
  But now, O hero, quickly depart from here together with me, and console your
  friend who is afflicted with grief for his wife’s abduction.
'20': >-
  And whatever harsh words I spoke to you after hearing Rāma’s speech when he
  was overwhelmed with sorrow—pardon that, my friend.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-sixth sarga of the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, called “The Conciliation of Sugrīva
  and Lakṣmaṇa.”
