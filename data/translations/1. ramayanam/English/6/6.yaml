  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the sixth
  chapter, entitled “Rāvaṇa’s Consultation (Council)”.
'1': >-
  Seeing the dreadful and fearsome deed that had been wrought in Laṅkā, the lord
  of the rākṣasas—somewhat downcast in shame—addressed all the rākṣasas, as
  though Indra were speaking after being struck by the great-souled Hanumān.
'2': >-
  That Laṅkā—an impregnable city—has been violated and entered by him, by a
  single monkey alone; and Sītā, Janakī herself, has also been seen by him.
'3': >-
  A palace has been outraged, a sacred shrine has been violated, the foremost
  rākṣasas have been slain, and the entire city of Laṅkā has been thrown into
  turmoil by Hanumān.
'4': >-
  “What shall I do? Welfare to you all! What course is proper for you and for me
  thereafter? Tell us what is feasible—what should be done, and what would also
  turn out to be well accomplished.”
'5': >-
  The wise declare that victory is rooted in counsel; therefore, O mighty ones,
  I approve of taking counsel concerning Rāma.
'6': >-
  There are three kinds of men in the world—highest, lowest, and middling. Of
  them, when assembled, I shall speak of their merits and faults.
'7': >-
  Counsel is indeed effective when joined with three who are competent in
  determining counsel—friends also who share the same aim, and kinsmen as well,
  especially those of weight and authority.
'8': >-
  He who, having consulted in harmony (with such advisors), sets enterprises
  into motion, and who also exerts himself with regard to destiny (the divine
  factor), him they call the best of men.
'9': >-
  One considers the matter (its objective), another sets his mind upon
  righteousness (dharma), and another executes the tasks; such a man they call a
  middling man.
'10': >-
  He who, without ascertaining merits and faults, abandoning reliance upon
  destiny, disregards the undertaking saying, ‘I shall do it (later),’—he is the
  lowest of men.
'11': >-
  Just as these men are ever of three kinds—highest, lowest, and middling—so
  also should counsel itself be understood to be highest, lowest, and middling.
'12': >-
  That counsel is called the highest wherein the ministers, arriving at
  unanimity and viewing with eyes guided by the teachings of the śāstras, are
  diligently engaged.
'13': >-
  Where, though many opinions are entertained, the ministers’ decision regarding
  the matter finally returns again to oneness—such counsel is remembered as
  middling.
'14': >-
  Where, clinging to one another’s opinions, they argue back and forth, and
  there is no benefit in unanimity—such counsel is called the lowest.
'15': >-
  Therefore, O you best of intellect, having deliberated well, you should
  proceed to what is to be done—this is my considered judgment in the matter.
'16': >-
  For Rāma, surrounded by thousands of steadfast monkeys, is coming toward the
  city of Laṅkā, to lay siege against us.
'17': >-
  And the Rāghava will clearly cross the ocean with ease—swiftly, in fitting
  manner—together with his younger brother and with his forces and followers.
'18': >-
  He may even dry up the sea by his valor, or do something else (equally
  extraordinary). Therefore, in a matter such as this—opposed as we are by the
  monkeys—let everything that is beneficial for the city and for the army be
  deliberated upon fully, with my counsel.
'19': >-
  Thus ends the sixth chapter, entitled “Rāvaṇa’s Consultation (Council)”, in
  the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
