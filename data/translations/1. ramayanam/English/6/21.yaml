  Now begins the twenty-first canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Churning of the Ocean.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon, upon the seashore, Rāghava spread a bed of darbha grass; and facing
  east, with hands joined in reverence, he lay down upon the great ocean’s edge.
'2': >-
  The slayer of foes placed beneath him his arm, resembling the coil of a mighty
  serpent—an arm formerly adorned with ornaments fashioned of gold.
'3': >-
  That arm, decked with bracelets of jewels and gold, with pearl-ornaments of
  the finest kind, had been touched and caressed again and again by noble women.
'4': >-
  It had been tended beforehand with sandal and aguru perfumes, and further
  beautified with sandal-paste gleaming like the radiance of the rising sun.
'5': >-
  With that excellent arm he had once graced the head of Sītā upon the bed; it
  was like the blissful contact of Takṣaka (the great serpent), cool and
  soothing as one who delights in the waters of the Gaṅgā.
'6': >-
  In battle it was like an age (yuga) in might, increasing the sorrow of
  enemies; it was long, a delight to friends, and a refuge reaching to the very
  bounds of the sea.
'7': >-
  Then, as he lay, his left arm—its skin hardened by the repeated slap of the
  bowstring—was placed again; and his right arm, like a great iron bar, he set
  to the right.
'8': >-
  Laying down that mighty arm, a bestower of a thousand cows, he resolved:
  “Today, for me, there shall be either a crossing—or else death—because of the
  ocean.”
'9': >-
  Thus, having steadied his resolve, great-armed Rāma lay down upon the great
  ocean, in due observance, restrained and intent, like a sage.
'10': >-
  As Rāma slept upon the earth strewn with kuśa grass—vigilant in his vow—three
  nights passed over him.
'11': >-
  Having spent three nights there, that sinless one, devoted to righteousness,
  then continued to supplicate the ocean, lord of rivers.
'12': >-
  Yet the ocean, dull and unresponsive toward Rāma, did not reveal his form,
  though Rāma—striving earnestly—had worshipped him with all due honors.
'13': >-
  Then Rāma, angered at the ocean, his eyes red at the corners, spoke these
  words to Lakṣmaṇa of auspicious marks who stood nearby:
'14': >-
  “Because of the ocean’s arrogance he does not appear of his own accord. And
  calmness, forbearance, patience, straightforwardness, and gentle speech—
'15': >-
  —these virtues of the good bear fruit only where there is worth; among the
  unworthy, they yield only incapacity. As for the self-praising, wicked
  man—insolent, brazen, ever running in opposition—
'16': >-
  the world honors such a man everywhere, since punishment is withheld from him.
  By conciliation alone, fame cannot be won; by conciliation alone, glory cannot
  be gained.
'17': >-
  “Therefore, Lakṣmaṇa, to obtain victory in this world—even at the very head of
  battle—today, with my arrows, I shall shatter the sea, the abode of makaras.”
'18': >-
  “With the waters checked on all sides, O Saumitrī, behold it—swollen and
  heaving. Behold the coils of the serpents, O Lakṣmaṇa, cloven by me.”
'19': >-
  “Here are the vast coils of fishes, and here the trunks of elephants; here is
  a mass of conch-shells and oysters, and there, shoals of fish and makaras as
  well.”
'20': >-
  “Today, with a mighty combat, I shall dry up the ocean; for this abode of
  makaras deems me one joined only with forbearance.”
'21': >-
  “Fie on such patience in a man like me—he takes me to be powerless. By gentle
  means the ocean does not show me his own form.”
'22': >-
  “Bring the bow, Saumitrī, and the arrows that are like venomous serpents. I
  shall dry up the ocean; let the vānaras go across on foot.”
'23': >-
  “Today, though unshakable, when wrathful I shall shake the ocean—crowded with
  a thousand waves, and bound within its shore by an established limit.”
'24': >-
  “With my shafts I shall make the abode of Varuṇa exceed all bounds. I shall
  churn the great sea, filled with mighty Dānavas.”
'25': >-
  Having spoken thus, bow in hand, eyes widened with anger, Rāma became
  irresistible—blazing like the fire at the end of an age.
'26': >-
  Gripping the dreadful bow tight, and making the world tremble with his arrows,
  he released fierce-flying shafts, like Indra of a hundred sacrifices hurling
  thunderbolts.
'27': >-
  Those blazing, swift, excellent arrows, aflame with splendor, entered the
  waters of the ocean, terrifying the serpents within.
'28': >-
  The rush of the ocean’s waters—together with fishes and makaras—became
  exceedingly dreadful, and so too the roar of the wind.
'29': >-
  Spread out with garlands of great waves, strewn over with conches and oysters,
  the great ocean became as if smoking, its billows whirling and overturning.
'30': >-
  The serpents were distressed, with mouths aflame and eyes blazing; and the
  Dānavas of great valor, dwellers in the nether regions, were troubled as well.
'31': >-
  The waves of the sovereign of rivers, together with sharks and makaras, rose
  up by thousands, like Vindhya and Mandara mountains in form.
'32': >-
  The abode of Varuṇa resounded—its surging masses of waves whirled about;
  serpent-demons were thrown into confusion; huge crocodiles were cast up and
  overturned.
'33': >-
  Then Saumitrī, springing up to that Rāghava of terrible vehemence who was
  drawing his immeasurable bow, and breathing hard, said, “Come to
  yourself!”—and seized hold of the bow.
'34': >-
  “Even without this, O foremost of heroes, your purpose will be accomplished
  today. Men like you do not fall under the sway of anger. May you look far
  ahead to the conduct of the righteous.”
'35': >-
  And from the sky—though remaining unseen—by Brahmarṣis and by divine ṛṣis, a
  sound was raised, crying, “Alas!” and “Come to yourself!” in a great voice.
'36': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-first canto, entitled “The Churning of the Ocean,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
