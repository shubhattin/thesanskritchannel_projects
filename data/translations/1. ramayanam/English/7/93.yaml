  Now begins the ninety-third canto in the Uttarakāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Vālmīki’s Message.”
'1': >-
  While that most wondrous sacrifice was thus in progress, the sage
  Vālmīki—foremost among ascetics—came swiftly, accompanied by his disciples.
'2': >-
  Beholding that sacrifice, resplendent as the divine and marvelous to behold,
  he, in a secluded spot near the hermitages of the seers, caused auspicious
  leaf-huts to be made.
'3': >-
  And close by, in that delightful grove of Vālmīki, he had many carts set
  there, filled with fair fruits and roots.
'4': >-
  That mighty-splendored Vālmīki—great-souled and supremely self-possessed—was
  duly honored by the king and by the high-minded sages, and he dwelt there.
'5': >-
  Then, rejoicing, he spoke to his two disciples: “Go forth, composed in mind,
  and with the greatest delight sing the entire poem of the Rāmāyaṇa.
'6': >-
  Sing it in the holy groves of the seers and in the dwellings of the brāhmaṇas;
  in the streets and on the royal highways; and in the houses of princes as
  well.
'7': >-
  And at the doorway of Rāma’s palace, where the rites are being
  performed—especially there—sing it in the presence of the officiating priests.
'8': >-
  And here are these fruits—sweet and of many kinds—grown on mountain peaks;
  having tasted what is pleasant to taste, sing on.
'9': >-
  You shall not come to fatigue, my dear sons, after eating those fruits and
  well-cleaned roots; and you shall remain outside the city.
'10': >-
  If Rāma, the lord of the earth, should summon you for the sake of hearing,
  then, when the sages are seated, let your singing proceed.
'11': >-
  Each day, twenty cantos are to be sung in a sweet voice, with the many
  measures and standards that were taught by me before, as prescribed.
'12': >-
  And no greed is to be practiced, not even a little, through desire for wealth.
  What need have those who dwell in hermitages—living on fruits and roots—of
  riches?
'13': >-
  If that scion of the Kakutsthas should ask you, ‘Whose sons are you, boys?’
  then tell the king thus: ‘We are the disciples of Vālmīki himself.’
'14': >-
  Having tuned these strings so very sweet, and taking your stand in a place
  pleasing and newly seen, sing sweetly, free from agitation.
'15': >-
  Let it be sung from the very beginning, and do not treat the sovereign with
  contempt; for by dharma the king is the father of all beings.
'16': >-
  Therefore you two, glad of heart, being ready at dawn tomorrow, sing the sweet
  song—accompanied by the rhythm and the harmony of the lute.
'17': >-
  Having thus instructed them many times, the sage, son of Pracetā (Vālmīki),
  most generous and of great renown, fell silent.
'18': >-
  So instructed by that sage, those two sons of Maithilī (Sītā) departed,
  thinking, ‘So indeed it shall be done’—those two subduers of foes.
'19': >-
  Placing that wondrous speech of the sage within their hearts, the two princes,
  eager with anticipation, passed the night together—like the two Aśvins keeping
  in mind the treatise on conduct taught by Bhṛgu.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-third canto in the Uttarakāṇḍa of the holy, illustrious
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the Ādikāvya, entitled “Vālmīki’s Message.”
