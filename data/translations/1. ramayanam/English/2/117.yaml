  Now begins the one-hundred-and-seventeenth sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the
  glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Praise of Sītā’s Wifely Devotion
  (pātivratya).”
'1': >-
  Then Rāghava, as those ascetics had departed, kept reflecting; and at that
  place he did not at that time approve of dwelling, for many reasons.
'2': >-
  “Here I have beheld Bharata, and the mothers as well, together with the people
  of the city; and that memory follows me, as I continually grieve for them.”
'3': >-
  Moreover, by the setting up of the army-camp of that great-souled one, there
  had been great trampling and disturbance, and also by the dung of horses and
  elephants.
'4': >-
  Therefore Rāghava, having resolved, “Let us go elsewhere,” set forth,
  accompanied by Vaidehī and also by Lakṣmaṇa.
'5': >-
  Having reached the hermitage of Atri, the illustrious one paid him reverence;
  and the blessed sage Atri too received him as though he were his own son.
'6': >-
  Having himself arranged for hospitality and had everything properly and
  respectfully prepared for him, he also comforted Saumitrī, and the highly
  fortunate Sītā alike.
'7': >-
  And having invited and duly honored his aged wife who had come there, that
  knower of dharma—ever engaged in the welfare of all beings—comforted her as
  well.
'8': >-
  To Anasūyā, the highly fortunate ascetic woman, a practiser of dharma, the
  best of sages said, “Receive Vaidehī.” And to Rāma he spoke of that ascetic
  woman, the practiser of dharma.
'9': >-
  “When the world had been continually scorched by ten years of drought, it was
  she by whom roots and fruits were brought forth, and the Jāhnavī (Gaṅgā) was
  made to flow.”
'10': >-
  “Endowed with fierce austerity and adorned with observances, it is she by whom
  great tapas was practised for ten thousand years.”
'11': >-
  “Anasūyā, bathed in vows, has warded off obstacles; and for the sake of a
  divine task, she—making haste—made a single night into ten nights. She is to
  you, O sinless one, like a mother.”
'12': >-
  “Let Vaidehī approach this illustrious lady—worthy of reverence by all
  beings—who is aged and ever free from anger, she who in the world has attained
  renown by her deeds as ‘Anasūyā.’”
'13': >-
  Thus addressed by the sage, Rāghava replied, “So be it,” and then spoke this
  excellent speech to Sītā, who knew dharma:
'14': >-
  “Princess, you have heard what this sage has declared. For your own highest
  good, quickly go near that ascetic woman.”
'15': >-
  Hearing these words of Rāghava, who sought her welfare, Sītā the Maithilī
  approached Atri’s wife, the knower of dharma.
'16': >-
  She was slack and wrinkled, aged, with hair whitened by old age; her limbs
  were ever trembling, like a plantain tree in the wind.
'17': >-
  But Sītā, without agitation, greeted that highly fortunate Anasūyā, devoted to
  her husband, uttering her own name aloud.
'18': >-
  And having saluted that blameless ascetic lady, Vaidehī, with folded hands and
  full of joy, asked after her well-being.
'19': >-
  Then, seeing Sītā—highly fortunate and established in dharma—she joyfully
  spoke while comforting her: “Blessed indeed are you, for you keep dharma in
  view.”
'20': >-
  “Abandoning your kinsfolk, O Sītā, and also honor and prosperity, O fair one,
  you follow Rāma—now restrained to the forest. Fortunate indeed are you.”
'21': >-
  “Whether he be in the city or in the forest, whether sinful or whether
  virtuous—those women for whom their husband is dear, for them the worlds are
  of great exaltation.”
'22': >-
  “Whether of bad conduct, or given to sensual ways, or even deprived of
  wealth—the husband is the supreme deity to women of noble disposition.”
'23': >-
  “I do not see any kinsman superior to him, as I reflect, O Vaidehī—he is fit
  in every way, like imperishable merit wrought by austerity.”
'24': >-
  “But wicked women do not recognize his virtues and faults—those whose hearts
  are set on talk of desire, who roam about while yet having husbands as their
  masters.”
'25': >-
  “Such women, O Maithilī—fallen under the sway of what ought not to be
  done—attain ill-fame and also a falling away from dharma.”
'26': >-
  “But women like you, endowed with virtues and discerning the higher and the
  lower worlds, will walk in heaven, even as those who have performed dharma.”
'27': >-
  “Therefore, being one who faithfully follows him—true and conforming to the
  established rule of chaste wives—be a companion of your husband in the
  practice of dharma; then you shall obtain both renown and righteousness.”
'28': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-seventeenth sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the
  venerable Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, called “The Praise of Sītā’s
  Wifely Devotion (pātivratya).”
