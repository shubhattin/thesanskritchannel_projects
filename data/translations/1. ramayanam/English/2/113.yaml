  Now begins the one-hundred-and-thirteenth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the
  holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Taking Up of the Sandals
  (Pādukā-grahaṇam).”
'1': >-
  Then Bharata, placing those sandals upon his head, joyfully mounted the
  chariot, accompanied by Śatrughna.
'2': >-
  Vasiṣṭha and Vāmadeva, and Jābāli of firm vows— all those ministers, honoured
  for their counsel—went on ahead.
'3': >-
  Then, facing east, they proceeded to the lovely river Mandākinī, and, keeping
  the great mountain Citrakūṭa on their right, they went making pradakṣiṇā
  around it.
'4': >-
  Beholding by its side thousands of ores and minerals, delightful and of many
  kinds, Bharata then advanced with his whole army.
'5': >-
  Not far from Citrakūṭa, Bharata then beheld the hermitage where the sage
  Bharadvāja had made his dwelling.
'6': >-
  Approaching that hermitage of Bharadvāja, wise Bharata alighted from the
  chariot and bowed down at the sage’s feet.
'7': >-
  Then Bharadvāja, rejoicing, spoke these words to Bharata: “Has the duty been
  accomplished, dear child, and have you met with Rāma?”
'8': >-
  Thus addressed by the wise Bharadvāja, Bharata, devoted to his brother,
  replied to him.
'9': >-
  Rāghava—firm in valour—being entreated by the preceptor and by me, and being
  exceedingly pleased, spoke these words to Vasiṣṭha:
'10': >-
  “I shall truly uphold that very vow of my father—those fourteen years which
  are my father’s pledge.”
'11': >-
  Thus spoken to, the greatly wise Vasiṣṭha replied—skilled in speech,
  understanding words, to Rāghava’s lofty utterance:
'12': >-
  “Joyfully bestow these sandals, adorned with gold, upon Ayodhyā, O greatly
  wise one—these which shall secure your welfare and protection.”
'13': >-
  Thus addressed by Vasiṣṭha, Rāghava, standing facing east, mounted those very
  sandals and bestowed them, indeed, for my kingdom (to rule in my stead).
'14': >-
  “Having taken up these auspicious sandals, and having been permitted to depart
  by the high-souled Rāma, I now return, going to Ayodhyā alone.”
'15': >-
  Hearing these auspicious words of the great-souled Bharata, the sage
  Bharadvāja spoke to him words still more auspicious.
'16': >-
  “This is no wonder, O tiger among men, best of those endowed with good conduct
  and noble ways, since in you righteousness abides—like water naturally flowing
  down into a low place.”
'17': >-
  “Immortal indeed is your mighty-armed father Daśaratha, whose son you are—such
  as you: a knower of dharma and one who cherishes dharma.”
'18': >-
  Then, with palms joined, having heard the utterance of that great-souled ṛṣi,
  Bharata began to take counsel with him, clasping his feet.
'19': >-
  Thereafter, having circumambulated Bharadvāja again and again, the illustrious
  Bharata set forth for Ayodhyā together with the ministers.
'20': >-
  That vast host which followed Bharata—returning back—spread out with chariots
  and carts, with horses and elephants.
'21': >-
  Then, having crossed the divine river Yamunā, garlanded with waves, they all
  again beheld the Gaṅgā, that river of auspicious waters.
'22': >-
  Crossing that charming river, full of water, together with his kinsmen, and
  with his army, he entered the delightful Śṛṅgiberapura.
'23': And from Śṛṅgiberapura he again beheld Ayodhyā.
'24': >-
  Then, seeing Ayodhyā bereft of father and brother, Bharata, scorched with
  sorrow, spoke thus to his charioteer:
'25': >-
  “O charioteer, behold—Ayodhyā lies desolate; it does not shine forth. It is
  formless, joyless, wretched, its voices and sounds subdued.”
'26': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-thirteenth sarga in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the
  venerable Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Taking Up of the
  Sandals (Pādukā-grahaṇam).”
