  Now begins the eighty‑fourth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Unfolding of Indrajit’s Illusion.”
'1': >-
  While Lakṣmaṇa—who loved his brother as his very life—was consoling Rāma, and
  after posting the detachments in their proper stations, Vibhīṣaṇa came there.
'2': >-
  He was surrounded by four heroic warriors, bearing diverse weapons—like
  leaders of elephant herds, dark as masses of blue collyrium, hemmed about by
  their troops.
'3': >-
  Approaching the high-souled Rāghava, who was melted in sorrow, he also beheld
  the vānaras, their eyes bewildered and troubled with tears.
'4': >-
  And he saw that great-souled Rāghava, the delight of the Ikṣvāku line, fallen
  into delusion, resting upon Lakṣmaṇa’s lap.
'5': >-
  Seeing Rāma abashed and scorched by grief, Vibhīṣaṇa—his own spirit cast down
  by inward pain—said, “What is this?”
'6': >-
  Beholding Vibhīṣaṇa’s face, Sugrīva, and those vānaras, Lakṣmaṇa—his eyes
  flooded with tears—spoke these words in a faint and broken manner:
'7': >-
  “Rāghava, gentle one, hearing from Hanumān’s report that ‘Sītā has been slain
  by Indrajit,’ has from that moment taken refuge in delusion.”
'8': >-
  Restraining Saumitri as he was speaking, Vibhīṣaṇa addressed sensibly these
  weighty words to Rāma, who had fallen unconscious:
'9': >-
  “What Hanumān told you, assuming the form of such anguish, I deem to be
  unfitting—like the drying up of the ocean itself.
'10': >-
  I know well the intention of the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, O mighty-armed one: he
  will not do violence to Sītā.
'11': >-
  Urged again and again by me, who sought your good, ‘Release Vaidehī,’ he did
  not follow that counsel.
'12': >-
  Neither by conciliation, nor by gifts, nor by sowing dissension—how much less
  by battle—could she be made available to be seen; indeed, she could not be
  beheld by anyone else at all.
'13': >-
  Having deluded the vānaras, that rākṣasa has withdrawn. Know, O mighty-armed
  one, that daughter of Janaka shown here to be an illusion, a creation of māyā.
'14': >-
  Today, having reached the sacred place Nikumbhilā, he will perform a
  fire‑oblation; and having offered oblations, he will advance—made formidable
  even to the gods together with Vāsava (Indra).
'15': >-
  Thereby this son of Rāvaṇa becomes hard to assail in battle. It is surely by
  him, intent on deluding, that this illusion has been employed.
'16': >-
  Seeking to create an obstacle there to the prowess of the vānaras, he acts
  thus. Let us go there with our forces before he completes that rite.
'17': >-
  Abandon this false grief that has befallen you, O tiger among men; for the
  whole army droops, seeing you worn away by sorrow.
'18': >-
  Here you must stand with a steady heart, with your courage uplifted. Send
  Lakṣmaṇa with us and with the divisions of the army in attendance.
'19': >-
  He, the tiger among men, will make that Rāvaṇi abandon that deed by means of
  sharp arrows; thereafter he will become fit to be slain.
'20': >-
  Then those keen, sharp arrows of his—winged with feathers, swift in their
  flight—will drink blood like inauspicious birds swooping down.
'21': >-
  Therefore, command Lakṣmaṇa, O mighty-armed one, he of auspicious marks, for
  the destruction of the rākṣasa—like the wielder of the thunderbolt dispatching
  the thunderbolt itself.
'22': >-
  O best of men, this is no time for delay, since today you are able to
  accomplish the destruction of the foe. Send forth, to slay the enemy, your
  thunderbolt—just as great Indra sent his bolt for the crushing of the enemy of
  the gods.
'23': >-
  For that bull among rākṣasas, when his rite is completed, becomes invisible in
  battle even to gods and asuras. If one were to contend with him once his work
  is finished, even for the gods there would arise great doubt (of victory).
'24': >-
  Thus ends the eighty‑fourth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Unfolding of Indrajit’s Illusion.”
