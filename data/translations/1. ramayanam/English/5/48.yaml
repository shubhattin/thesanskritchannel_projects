  Now begins the forty-eighth canto in the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Indrajit’s Assault (or Onset).”
'1': >-
  Then the lord of the rākṣasas, the great-souled Rāvaṇa, when his son Akṣa had
  been slain by Hanumān, composed his mind; and, filled with wrath, he commanded
  Indrajit—who was like a god in prowess.
'2': >-
  “You are a master of missiles, the foremost among those who bear weapons; a
  giver of grief even to gods and asuras. Your deeds have been witnessed among
  the gods together with Indra; and you have amassed celestial weapons through
  worship of Brahmā.”
'3': >-
  “Confronted with the might of your missiles, even the gods—together with the
  hosts of the Maruts—though taking refuge in the Lord of the gods, were unable
  to stand firm in battle.”
'4': >-
  “In the three worlds there is none who, in combat, remains unwearied; but you
  are guarded by the strength of your arms, and protected by austerity. You
  understand place and time and what is principal; you alone are the best in
  counsel.”
'5': >-
  “For you, in battles, no undertaking is impossible; and in deliberation guided
  by insight, nothing is unachievable. In the three worlds there exists no one
  who does not know your missile-power and your strength.”
'6': >-
  “Your strength born of austerity is worthy of me, and so are your valor and
  the might of your weapons in battle. Having reached you in the crushing of
  foes, my mind does not sink into fatigue—my purpose is certain.”
'7': >-
  “All the attendants have been slain, and the rākṣasa Jambumālī as well; and
  the heroic sons of ministers—five leaders of the army’s vanguard—have been
  killed.”
'8': >-
  “Mighty forces, well supplied, with horses, elephants, and chariots too; and
  your own beloved brother, the prince Akṣa, has been destroyed. Yet, O slayer
  of foes, my true reliance is not in them, but in you alone.”
'9': >-
  “Seeing this great army laid low, and the monkey’s majesty and valor, and also
  considering the substance of your own prowess—put forth speed and effort
  befitting your strength.”
'10': >-
  “When you draw near, the crushing of the army will cease, just as—when a foe
  is appeased—conflict subsides. Therefore, having weighed your own strength and
  the other’s, begin your enterprise, O foremost among weapon-bearers.”
'11': >-
  “No host of warriors is moved (to flight) merely by taking up the thunderbolt
  with its vast solidity; nor can the course of the Wind-god be measured, nor
  can one slay with mere action one who is like fire.”
'12': >-
  “Having thus rightly examined the matter, and being self-possessed through the
  balance of your own duty, remembering also the divine power of this hero’s
  bow, go forth unhurt and commence your task.”
'13': >-
  “Indeed, O best in counsel, it is not from caprice that I dispatch you. This
  is held to be the policy of kings and the wisdom proper to the kṣatriya.”
'14': >-
  “In battle with diverse weapons, O tamer of foes, skill must certainly be
  understood; and victory in war is to be desired and pursued.”
'15': >-
  Then, hearing his father’s words, Indrajit—mighty as Dakṣa’s daughter (i.e.,
  as a power born of that line)—circumambulated his lord (his father) with great
  haste, and the hero, resolved in mind, set himself for battle.
'16': >-
  Then Indrajit, honored by his beloved followers, fired up with the
  exhilaration of battle and with his courage raised high, entered into the
  fray.
'17': >-
  Illustrious, lotus-eyed, the son of the lord of rākṣasas—possessed of great
  splendor—went forth, like the ocean at the time of the full tide.
'18': >-
  That Indrajit, Indra-like in might, mounted a chariot harnessed with four
  tigers, sharp-fanged, swift as the king of birds, and of irresistible speed.
'19': >-
  That chariot-warrior—foremost among archers, skilled in weapons, the best
  among the knowers of missiles—sped quickly in his chariot to where Hanumān
  was.
'20': >-
  Hearing the rumble of that chariot and the twang of the bowstring, that heroic
  monkey became even more delighted.
'21': >-
  Indrajit, taking up his bow and arrows tipped with sharp steel, set out toward
  Hanumān—he, the expert in the science of war.
'22': >-
  Then, as he went forth to battle, bow in hand, and as Hanumān’s joy in combat
  arose, all the quarters became turbid, and beasts made many dreadful cries.
'23': >-
  There assembled nāgas and yakṣas, great sages, siddhas who move in the
  celestial regions; and flocks of birds, filling the sky, cried aloud in great
  exhilaration.
'24': >-
  Seeing that chariot coming swiftly, bearing Indra’s banner, the swift monkey
  roared a mighty roar and increased his speed.
'25': >-
  Indrajit, having taken refuge in that divine chariot and bearing a wondrous
  bow, drew his bow with a sound like lightning’s thunder.
'26': >-
  Then those two, of exceeding speed and great strength, fearless in battle,
  came together—Hanumān and the son of the lord of rākṣasas—like Indra and an
  asura-king, bound in enmity.
'27': >-
  The mighty one (Hanumān) struck down the swift rush of arrows of that heroic
  great chariot-warrior, the famed archer; and he ranged about in the
  path—immeasurable as his sire (the Wind).
'28': >-
  Then the hero, slayer of enemy-heroes, loosed sharp-pointed
  arrows—well-feathered, with golden and splendid shafts—well-directed, with the
  speed of a thunderbolt.
'29': >-
  Then Hanumān, hearing the sound of that chariot, and the sound of drums,
  kettledrums, and war-drums, and the noise of the bow as it was drawn, leapt up
  again.
'30': >-
  Swiftly the great monkey wheeled about amid the arrows, the monkey eluding the
  mark of that vigilant archer by releasing himself from the line of aim.
'31': >-
  Again he sprang forward before those arrows, and Hanumān—son of the Wind—leapt
  up, stretching out both hands.
'32': >-
  Both of them, endowed with speed and skilled in the conduct of war, wrought a
  most excellent combat, captivating the minds of all beings.
'33': >-
  The rākṣasa could find no opening in Hanumān, nor could Māru­ti find an
  opening in that great-souled one; meeting thus, those two—equal to gods in
  valor—became mutually insufferable (to each other).
'34': >-
  Then, as his mark was being foiled and his unerring arrows were rushing forth
  in vain, that great-souled Indrajit—steadfast through disciplined
  concentration—fell into deep and weighty thought.
'35': >-
  Then the son of the rākṣasa-king formed a resolve regarding that foremost
  monkey-hero: seeing that the monkey was not to be slain, how might he be
  seized, so as to restrain him?
'36': >-
  Then the hero, the best among those who know missiles, of exceedingly great
  splendor, set in place the Brahmā-weapon—the ancestral gift of Brahmā—against
  that best of monkeys.
'37': >-
  Knowing, “This one is not to be slain,” Indrajit, the knower of the truth of
  missiles, seized the mighty-armed son of the Wind with that weapon.
'38': >-
  Bound then by that missile by the rākṣasa, that monkey became motionless and
  fell upon the ground.
'39': >-
  Then, understanding that bondage of the missile, and (feigning) diminished
  vigor due to the weapon’s lordly power, that foremost monkey-hero pondered
  both the majesty of his master and the favor of Brahmā toward himself.
'40': >-
  Then Hanumān reflected upon the brahmāstra, empowered by self-born (Brahmā’s)
  mantras, and upon the boon he had received from Brahmā.
'41': >-
  “There is no power in me to release this bond, because of the might of the
  Guru of the worlds (Brahmā). Thus, this bond of a missile, so ordained, must
  be complied with by me, in keeping with the command of the Self-born.”
'42': >-
  Thus the monkey, considering the might of the missile and the grace of Brahmā
  toward himself, and considering also his own ability to free himself, chose to
  follow the ordinance of Brahmā.
'43': >-
  “Even though bound by a missile, fear does not arise in me—for I am protected
  by Brahmā and by the great Indra, and also by the Wind.”
'44': >-
  “And even in being seized by the rākṣasas, there is for me a great opportunity
  to have my worth recognized; therefore, let the others seize me, for thereby
  there may be speech with the lord of rākṣasas.”
'45': >-
  Resolved in purpose, slayer of enemy-heroes, acting with discernment, he
  ceased his efforts; and, forcibly approached and restrained by them, he roared
  even while being reviled again and again.
'46': >-
  Then those rākṣasas, seeing him motionless—the tamer of foes—bound him with
  strips of hemp and with thickly twisted bark-cloths.
'47': >-
  He even approved of that binding by others and the forced censure by the
  warriors, having resolved: “If, out of curiosity, the lord of rākṣasas should
  decide to see me…”
'48': >-
  Bound with that bark, yet freed from the missile, the mighty one remained: for
  the bond of a missile does not persist together with another bond.
'49': >-
  Then Indrajit, the hero, considering that best of monkeys bound with
  bark-cloth, and seeing him freed from the missile, fell into thought: “Though
  bound by another means, the missile’s effect still follows (or does it not)?”
'50': >-
  “Alas! A great deed has been done to no purpose; the rākṣasas have not
  understood the course of mantra and weaponry. And again, once a missile has
  been neutralized by a missile, no other missile proceeds further.” Thus all of
  them were cast into doubt.
'51': >-
  Released from the missile, Hanumān did not reveal it of himself; rather, being
  dragged by the rākṣasas and pressed by those bonds, he maintained the
  appearance (of captivity).
'52': >-
  Then, being struck by the cruel rākṣasas with iron mallets, that monkey was
  dragged close to the lord of rākṣasas (Rāvaṇa).
'53': >-
  Then Indrajit, seeing him freed from the missile yet bound by cords of
  bark-cloth, displayed there that mighty one—the foremost of monkey-heroes—to
  the king together with his attendants.
'54': >-
  That best of monkeys, bound like a maddened elephant, the rākṣasas reported to
  Rāvaṇa, the lord of rākṣasas.
'55': >-
  “Who is this? Whose is he? From where indeed has he come? What is his purpose?
  On whom does he rely?”—such talk arose among the rākṣasa heroes when they saw
  him.
'56': >-
  Some others, enraged there, spoke among themselves: “Let him be slain! Let him
  be burned! Or let him be devoured!”
'57': >-
  Having passed quickly along the way, the great-souled Hanumān there, at the
  foot of the lord of rākṣasas’ palace, saw aged attendants of the king and the
  mansion adorned with great jewels.
'58': >-
  Then the mighty Rāvaṇa saw that best of monkeys being dragged to and fro by
  rākṣasas of distorted and fearsome forms.
'59': >-
  And the best of monkeys also saw the lord of rākṣasas—endowed with splendor
  and strength—blazing like the sun.
'60': >-
  Daśānana, his eyes reddened by anger, gazed upon that monkey; then he
  commanded his chief ministers—elders in lineage and conduct—who were seated
  there, regarding him.
'61': >-
  Then, questioned by them in due order—first about the purpose, and at the
  outset about the root of the matter—the monkey declared: “I have come as the
  envoy of Rāma, lord of the monkeys.”
'62': >-
  Thus ends the forty-eighth canto in the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “Indrajit’s Assault (or Onset).”
