'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (the परमात्मा).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': >-
  Now, the Seventh Chapter: The Yoga of Knowledge and Realization (Jñāna–Vijñāna
  Yoga).
'3': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'4': >-
  O Pārtha (Arjuna), with your mind attached to Me, practicing yoga and taking
  refuge in Me—listen how you shall know Me fully and completely, without doubt.
'5': >-
  I shall declare to you, without remainder, this knowledge together with its
  direct realization; having known which, nothing else whatsoever remains here
  to be known.
'6': >-
  Among thousands of men, scarcely one strives for perfection; and even among
  those who strive and have attained perfection, scarcely one knows Me in truth.
'7': >-
  Earth, water, fire, air, and ether (space); mind, intellect, and
  ego-sense—thus is My prakṛti divided eightfold.
'8': >-
  This is My lower nature. But know My other nature, higher than this, O
  mighty-armed one—the life-principle (jīva) by which this world is sustained.
'9': >-
  Know this: all beings have these as their source. I am the origin of the
  entire universe, and likewise its dissolution (end) as well.
'10': >-
  O Dhanañjaya (Arjuna), there is nothing whatsoever higher than Me. All this is
  strung on Me, as clusters of gems are strung on a thread.
'11': >-
  O son of Kuntī, I am the taste in waters; I am the radiance in the moon and
  the sun; I am the sacred syllable Om in all the Vedas; I am sound in ether
  (space), and manliness (valor) in men.
'12': >-
  I am the pure fragrance in the earth, and I am the brilliance in fire; I am
  the life in all beings, and I am austerity in ascetics.
'13': >-
  Know Me, O Pārtha, as the eternal seed of all beings. I am the intellect of
  the intelligent, and I am the splendor of the splendid.
'14': >-
  And I am the strength of the strong—free from desire and attachment. And, O
  bull among the Bhāratas, I am desire in beings, insofar as it is not contrary
  to dharma.
'15': >-
  Whatever states of being there are—sāttvic, rājasic, and tāmasic—know them to
  be from Me alone; yet I am not in them—they are in Me.
'16': >-
  This entire world, deluded by these states constituted of the three guṇas,
  does not recognize Me, who am beyond these and imperishable.
'17': >-
  For this divine māyā of Mine, constituted of the guṇas, is difficult to cross.
  But those who take refuge in Me alone cross over this māyā.
'18': >-
  The evil-doers, the deluded, the lowest among men, do not take refuge in
  Me—those whose knowledge has been carried away by māyā, and who have adopted
  an asuric disposition.
'19': >-
  Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna: the distressed, the seeker of
  knowledge, the seeker of worldly gain, and the man of wisdom—O best of the
  Bhāratas.
'20': >-
  Among them, the man of wisdom—ever steadfast and devoted to the One
  alone—excels. For I am exceedingly dear to the man of wisdom, and he is dear
  to Me.
'21': >-
  All these indeed are noble; but the man of wisdom is deemed to be My very
  Self. For with his self united (in yoga), he abides in Me alone as the supreme
  goal.
'22': >-
  At the end of many births, the man of wisdom takes refuge in Me, realizing,
  ‘Vāsudeva is all.’ Such a great soul is very rare indeed.
'23': >-
  Those whose knowledge has been stolen away by various desires take refuge in
  other deities, following this or that rule, constrained by their own nature
  (prakṛti).
'24': >-
  Whatever form a devotee desires to worship with faith, that same faith of his
  I make firm and unshakable.
'25': >-
  Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that form; and from it
  he attains his desired objects—yet those are indeed granted by Me alone.
'26': >-
  But the fruit of those men of little understanding is finite. Worshipers of
  the gods go to the gods; but My devotees come to Me.
'27': >-
  The unintelligent think of Me—the Unmanifest—as having come into
  manifestation, not knowing My higher being, imperishable and unsurpassed.
'28': >-
  I am not manifest to all, being veiled by My yoga-māyā. This deluded world
  does not know Me, unborn and imperishable.
'29': >-
  O Arjuna, I know the beings of the past, the present, and the future; but no
  one knows Me.
'30': >-
  O Bhārata, by the delusion of the pairs of opposites arising from desire and
  aversion, all beings fall into bewilderment at the time of creation—O
  tormentor of foes.
'31': >-
  But those men of righteous deeds, whose sin has come to an end, being freed
  from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me with firm resolve and
  steadfast vows.
'32': >-
  Those who strive for liberation from old age and death, taking refuge in
  Me—they know Brahman wholly, and they know the entire inner Self (adhyātma)
  and all action (karma) as well.
'33': >-
  Those who know Me with the adhibhūta (the realm of beings), with the adhidaiva
  (the realm of the divine), and also with the adhiyajña (the principle of
  sacrifice)—they, with minds united (in yoga), know Me even at the time of
  departure (death).
'34': >-
  Om Tat Sat—thus in the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, among the Upaniṣads, in the
  knowledge of Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue between Śrī
  Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, ends the Seventh Chapter, entitled ‘The Yoga of Knowledge
  and Realization.’
