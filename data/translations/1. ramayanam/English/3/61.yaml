  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the sixty-first
  chapter, named “The Search for Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Seeing the hermitage-grounds deserted, Rāma, the son of Daśaratha, beheld the
  leaf-thatched hut lying empty, and the seats also cast aside and thrown about.
'2': >-
  Not seeing Vaidehī there, and looking all around in every direction, Rāma
  cried aloud, clasping his beautiful arms as though to brace himself, and
  spoke.
'3': >-
  “Where indeed is Vaidehī, Lakṣmaṇa? To what place has she gone from here? By
  whom has she been carried off, O Saumitri—or by whom has my beloved been
  devoured?”
'4': >-
  “If, O Sītā, you desire to bar me by hiding behind a tree and to laugh at me,
  enough of such laughter today—come to me, who am exceedingly afflicted.”
'5': >-
  “Those gentle fawn-cubs, O Sītā, with whom you used to play in trust and
  affection—now, bereft of you, O fair one, they brood with eyes filled with
  tears.”
'6': >-
  “Deprived of Sītā, I truly cannot live, Lakṣmaṇa. I am overwhelmed by a great
  grief born of Sītā’s abduction.”
'7': >-
  “In the other world, my father, the great king, will surely behold me and say:
  ‘How, having received my pledge, were you entrusted by me…?’”
'8': >-
  “…and yet, without fulfilling that appointed time, you have returned to me
  here—one who follows desire, who is ignoble in conduct, indeed a speaker of
  falsehood.”
'9': >-
  “‘Fie upon you!’—thus plainly will my father speak to me in the other world,
  seeing me helpless, scorched by grief, wretched, and with my hopes shattered.”
'10': >-
  “Abandoning me here—piteous as I am—like fame abandoning a man who is not
  straightforward, where will you go, O fair-hipped one? Do not forsake me, O
  slender-waisted lady.”
'11': >-
  “Separated from you, I shall give up my own life.” Lamenting thus, Rāma,
  longing for the sight of Sītā, bewailed.
'12': >-
  Rāghava, sorely afflicted with grief, did not behold the daughter of Janaka;
  and as he failed to reach Sītā, he remained wholly given over to sorrow.
'13': >-
  Like a great elephant sinking upon reaching a vast mire, so seemed Rāma; and
  Lakṣmaṇa, desiring his brother’s welfare, spoke to him with earnestness.
'14': >-
  “Do not yield to dejection, O great-minded one. Make effort together with me.
  This excellent mountain, O hero, is adorned with many caves.”
'15': >-
  “Maithilī loves roaming in delightful groves, and she is, as it were,
  intoxicated with the forest’s charms. She may have entered the woods, or a
  lotus-pool rich with blooming flowers.”
'16': >-
  “Or she may have reached a river, frequented by fish and by vañjula-trees; or,
  wishing to startle you, she may be hiding somewhere in the woodland.”
'17': >-
  “Vaidehī, O bull among men, may be trying to learn about you and me.
  Therefore, O illustrious one, let us swiftly apply ourselves to searching for
  her.”
'18': >-
  “Let us search the entire forest where the daughter of Janaka may be. If you
  agree, O Kakutstha, then do not let your mind sink into grief.”
'19': >-
  Thus addressed by Lakṣmaṇa out of brotherly affection, Rāma, regaining
  composure, began to search, together with Saumitri.
'20': >-
  Those two sons of Daśaratha searched completely—through forests and mountains,
  and also rivers and lakes—seeking Sītā.
'21': >-
  They searched thoroughly the slopes of that mountain, its rocks and its peaks,
  yet they did not come upon her at all.
'22': >-
  Having examined the mountain on every side, Rāma said to Lakṣmaṇa: “Here, O
  Saumitri, I do not see auspicious Vaidehī upon the mountain.”
'23': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, scorched by sorrow, spoke to his radiant elder brother as they
  roamed in the Daṇḍaka forest.
'24': >-
  “You will attain Maithilī, the daughter of Janaka, O greatly wise one—just as
  mighty-armed Viṣṇu, having bound Bali, won this earth.”
'25': >-
  Spoken to thus by the valiant Lakṣmaṇa, that Rāghava, his mind struck down by
  grief, replied in a dejected voice:
'26': >-
  “The entire forest has been well searched; the lotus-ponds have fully
  blossomed lotuses; and this mountain too, O greatly wise one, has many caves
  and waterfalls. Yet I do not see Vaidehī, dearer to me even than my very
  life-breaths.”
'27': >-
  Thus lamenting, Rāma, worn down by Sītā’s abduction, wretched and immersed in
  grief, became distraught for a while.
'28': >-
  His whole body shaken with agitation, his understanding gone and his senses
  failing, the afflicted and miserable one sat down, breathing out long, cool
  sighs.
'29': >-
  Again and again, Rāma of lotus-like eyes sighed repeatedly, crying out many
  times, “Alas, my beloved!” with his voice choked by tears.
'30': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, his dear kinsman, consoled him in many ways; himself distressed
  with grief, he spoke humbly, with joined palms in reverence.
'31': >-
  But disregarding those words that fell from Lakṣmaṇa’s lips, and not seeing
  his beloved Sītā, he cried out again and again.
'32': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-first chapter of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Search for Sītā.”
