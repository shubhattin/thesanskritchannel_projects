  Now begins the sixty-second chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the sacred
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Rāvaṇa’s Supplication (to Kumbhakarṇa).”
'1': >-
  But that tiger among rākṣasas—Kumbhakarṇa—his mind still confounded by the
  heaviness of sleep and intoxication, endowed with mighty prowess, proceeded
  along the royal highway, a road adorned with splendour.
'2': >-
  Surrounded by thousands of rākṣasas, and himself exceedingly difficult to
  overcome, he then went forth while, from the houses, showers of flowers were
  being scattered upon him.
'3': >-
  He beheld the vast and delightful mansion of the lord of rākṣasas, spread over
  with lattices of gold, and shining to the sight like the radiance of the sun.
'4': >-
  Then, as the sun enters a net of clouds, he entered the dwelling of the
  overlord of rākṣasas, and from a distance he saw his elder brother seated upon
  a throne, like Śakra (Indra) himself seated upon his seat in heaven.
'5': >-
  As he went to his brother’s palace, accompanied by hosts of rākṣasas,
  Kumbhakarṇa, by the very placing down of his feet, caused the earth to
  tremble.
'6': >-
  Having reached his brother’s house and passed into the inner chambers, he saw
  his revered elder brother seated there in agitation upon the aerial car
  Puṣpaka.
'7': >-
  Then, seeing Kumbhakarṇa standing present, Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa), delighted,
  quickly rose up and drew him close.
'8': >-
  Then the mighty Kumbhakarṇa, at his brother’s couch, bowed down to his
  brother’s feet and said, “What is to be done?”
'9': >-
  Springing up joyfully, Rāvaṇa embraced him; and he, embraced by his brother,
  was duly greeted and welcomed.
'10': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa received an auspicious and divine excellent seat; and taking that
  seat, the mighty Kumbhakarṇa sat.
'11': >-
  With eyes reddened by anger, Kumbhakarṇa spoke to Rāvaṇa these words: “For
  what reason, O king, have I been roused by you with such urgency?”
'12': >-
  “Tell me—why is there fear for you here, and who is it that is about to die?”
  Thus stood Kumbhakarṇa, his brother, in wrath; and Rāvaṇa addressed him.
'13': >-
  With eyes rolling in fury, he spoke: “Today a very great crisis has come upon
  you, O mighty one, while you lay asleep.
'14': >-
  You, sleeping, do not know the fear that has arisen for me because of Rāma.
  This illustrious son of Daśaratha, powerful and accompanied by Sugrīva,
'15': >-
  has crossed the ocean and is cutting at our very root. Come—behold in Laṅkā
  the forests and the pleasure-groves as well!
'16': >-
  Having come with ease by means of a bridge, the vānaras have turned the ocean
  into something passable. Those rākṣasas who were foremost among us have been
  slain in battle by the vānaras.
'17': >-
  I do not, in any manner whatsoever, see the destruction of the vānaras in war;
  nor have the vānaras ever previously been conquered in battle.
'18': >-
  Therefore this fear has arisen. Protect us here, O mighty-armed one. Destroy
  these foes today—on this account you have been awakened.
'19': >-
  Even though your treasury and resources are entirely spent, come now to my
  aid. Save this city of Laṅkā, where only children and the aged remain.
'20': >-
  For your brother’s sake, O long-armed hero, perform this deed that is
  exceedingly difficult. Never before have I spoken thus to any brother, O
  scorcher of foes.
'21': >-
  In you abide my affection, and my highest confidence as well, O bull among
  rākṣasas—for in wars of devas and asuras, many a time,
'22': >-
  you have arrayed yourself against the devas, and in battle the asuras too were
  vanquished (by you).
'23': >-
  Therefore, exert all that valour, O hero of dreadful might; for among all
  beings there is seen no one equal to you in strength.
'24': >-
  Do for me this excellent deed—pleasing and beneficial—O beloved in battle, O
  dear to your kinsmen. By your own fiery energy afflict and crush the hostile
  army, like a great wind arisen scatters and drives apart a rain-laden autumn
  cloud.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-second chapter of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the sacred
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “Rāvaṇa’s Supplication.”
