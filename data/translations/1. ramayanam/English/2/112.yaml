  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-twelfth sarga, called “The Bestowal of the Sandals
  (Pādukā-pradānam).”
'1': >-
  Beholding the thrilling meeting of the two brothers—both possessed of
  incomparable splendor and prowess—the assembled great seers, filled with
  amazement, looked on.
'2': >-
  The hosts of ṛṣis—together with Siddhas and supreme sages, some manifest and
  some withdrawing from sight—praised those two great-souled brothers, the
  illustrious scions of the Kakutstha line.
'3': >-
  “Blessed indeed is he whose two sons are both knowers of dharma, both valiant
  in dharma. Having heard the speech exchanged between you two, we truly long
  for such words and rejoice in them.”
'4': >-
  Then the gathered companies of sages, intent upon the slaying of Daśagrīva
  (Rāvaṇa), spoke swiftly these words to Bharata, the tiger among kings:
'5': >-
  “O man of noble intellect, born in a great lineage, of lofty conduct and great
  renown—accept as authoritative the word of Rāma, if you have regard for your
  father.”
'6': >-
  “We desire that this Rāma should remain free of debt to his father. And it is
  because Kaikeyī’s claim was fully met that Daśaratha has gone to heaven with
  his debt discharged.”
'7': >-
  Having spoken thus, the Gandharvas, the great sages, and the royal sages—all
  of them—then departed, each to his own abode and course.
'8': >-
  Gladdened by those auspicious words, and himself of auspicious aspect,
  Rāma—his face bright with delight—honored and worshiped those seers.
'9': >-
  But Bharata, his limbs slack with emotion, and his voice faltering, spoke once
  more to Rāghava with joined palms:
'10': >-
  “Having regard to the dharma of kings and to the unbroken tradition of our
  house, O Kakutstha, you ought to fulfill my request—and my mother’s entreaty
  as well.”
'11': >-
  “Alone I do not have the strength to protect so vast a kingdom, nor likewise
  to keep the townsmen and countryfolk devoted and well-contented.”
'12': >-
  “For our kinsmen, warriors, allies, and friends all look to you alone—just as
  farmers look to the rain-cloud.”
'13': >-
  “Therefore, O great-minded one, take up and establish this kingship. O
  Kakutstha, you are capable of protecting the world.”
'14': >-
  Having spoken thus, Bharata then fell at his brother’s feet; sweet of speech,
  he repeatedly and earnestly entreated Rāma alone.
'15': >-
  Taking his brother upon his lap, Rāma himself spoke—dark-hued,
  lotus-petal-eyed, and with a voice like that of a rapturous swan:
'16': >-
  “This understanding that has come to you is your own—born of good breeding and
  discipline. Indeed, dear brother, you are fully able even to protect the
  earth.”
'17': >-
  “Taking counsel on every matter with ministers, friends, wise advisers, and
  counselors, accomplish even the most weighty affairs.”
'18': >-
  “The goddess of fortune might depart from the moon, or Himavān might abandon
  his snow; the ocean might overstep its shoreline—yet I shall not transgress my
  father’s pledge.”
'19': >-
  “Whether from desire, dear brother, or from greed, this was done to you by
  your mother. You must not take it to heart; rather, you should conduct
  yourself toward her as toward a mother.”
'20': >-
  While he was speaking thus, Bharata replied to Kausalyā’s son—Rāma, radiant
  like the sun, whose face was like the moon at its waxing:
'21': >-
  “Place upon your feet these sandals, adorned with gold, fit to be worn. For
  these will secure the welfare and safety (yoga-kṣema) of the whole world.”
'22': >-
  That tiger among men, of exceeding splendor, mounted the sandals and then
  stepped down from them, and bestowed them upon Bharata, the great-souled one.
'23': >-
  Bharata bowed to the sandals, and then spoke these words to Rāma: “For
  fourteen years, indeed, wearing matted hair and bark-garments, I—”
'24': >-
  “—shall live on fruits and roots, O hero, O delighter of the Raghu line,
  dwelling outside the city, longing always for your return.”
'25': >-
  “With the affairs of the kingdom entrusted to your sandals, O scorcher of
  foes—when the fourteen years are fully completed, on that very day, O best of
  the Raghus, if I do not behold you, then I shall enter the fire.”
'26': >-
  Saying, “So be it,” and making that pledge, Rāma embraced him with reverence;
  and embracing Śatrughna as well, he spoke this to Bharata:
'27': >-
  “Protect your mother Kaikeyī; do not direct anger toward her. O best of the
  Raghus, you are bound by an oath—by me and by Sītā as well.”
'28': >-
  Having spoken thus, Rāma—his eyes filled and veiled with tears—sent his
  brother away.
'29': >-
  Then Bharata, mighty in valor and knower of dharma, duly worshiped those
  beautifully adorned sandals of yours; and he circumambulated Rāghava, and
  placed them reverently upon his own head, the noblest of his limbs.
'30': >-
  Thereafter, in due order, the increaser of the Rāghava lineage—firm in his own
  dharma, immovable like Himavān—took leave of that assembly, honoring them in
  turn: the people, the elders, the ministers and citizens, and likewise his two
  younger brothers.
'31': >-
  His mothers, their throats choked with tears, could not bring themselves, in
  their grief, to bid him farewell. But Rāma bowed to them all, and, weeping,
  entered his own hut.
'32': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-twelfth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the holy,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the First Poet, called “The Bestowal of
  the Sandals (Pādukā-pradānam).”
