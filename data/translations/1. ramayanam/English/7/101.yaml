  Now begins the one-hundred-and-first chapter of the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the
  glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Establishment (Settlement) of Takṣa and
  Puṣkala.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that Bharata—the commander of the army—had arrived, the ruler of
  Kekaya, together with Yudhājit of the Gārgya line, was filled with the highest
  joy.
'2': >-
  The lord of Kekaya set out, surrounded by a great multitude of people;
  hastening onward, he advanced to meet those Gandharvas who could assume forms
  at will.
'3': >-
  Bharata and Yudhājit, both swift in prowess, together reached the city of the
  Gandharvas, accompanied by their forces and attended by their followers.
'4': >-
  And hearing that Bharata had come, those Gandharvas assembled; mighty heroes,
  eager to fight, they raised a great tumult on every side.
'5': >-
  Then a dreadful battle arose—fierce, tumultuous, and hair-raising—lasting
  seven nights; and neither side gained victory over the other.
'6': >-
  Men seized swords, javelins, and bows; streams ran with blood, and in every
  direction rivers seemed to flow bearing along the bodies of slain men.
'7': >-
  Thereupon Bharata, the younger brother of Rāma, angered, impelled against the
  Gandharvas a most terrible weapon of Kāla (Death/Time), called “Saṃvarta.”
'8': >-
  Bound by the noose of Kāla and rent asunder by Saṃvarta, in a moment three
  crores (thirty million) of those great-souled ones were struck down by that
  weapon.
'9': >-
  Even the dwellers in heaven do not recall a slaughter so dreadful—of
  great-souled warriors such as those—accomplished within the mere interval of a
  blink.
'10': >-
  When all of them had thus been slain, Bharata, the son of Kaikeyī, then
  established two supremely excellent and prosperous cities.
'11': >-
  He settled Takṣa at Takṣaśilā, and Puṣkala at Puṣkalāvatī—thus, above (over)
  Takṣa and Puṣkala; and that region lay in the charming country of the
  Gandharvas and within the realm of Gāndhāra.
'12': >-
  Those cities were crowded with heaps of wealth and jewels, and were beautified
  by groves; each was brought into mutual rivalry with the other through
  competition in the expansion of excellences and virtues.
'13': >-
  Both were renowned as exceedingly delightful, with blameless civic dealings
  and conduct; abundant in gardens and conveyances, with well-apportioned inner
  marketplaces.
'14': >-
  Both best of cities were charming and adorned with spacious layouts, and with
  principal mansions most lovely to behold, comparable in appearance to aerial
  palaces (vimānas).
'15': >-
  They were embellished with splendid and extensive shrines of the gods, and
  beautified with palms, tamāla trees, tilaka trees, and bakula trees.
'16': >-
  Having thus settled them and spending five years there, Bharata—Rāghava’s
  younger brother, mighty-armed and the son of Kaikeyī—returned again to
  Ayodhyā.
'17': >-
  He paid homage to the great-souled Rāghava, who was as though Dharma itself
  manifest in another form—just as Vāsava (Indra) would salute Brahmā.
'18': >-
  And he narrated in full what had occurred—the excellent slaying of the
  Gandharvas and the settlement of that land; hearing it, Rāghava was pleased
  with him.
'19': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-first chapter, named “The Establishment of Takṣa
  and Puṣkala,” in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primordial epic.
