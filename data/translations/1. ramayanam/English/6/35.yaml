  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, [begins] the
  thirty-fifth canto, called “Mālyavān’s Counsel.”
'1': >-
  Amid that resounding cry—mingled with the blast of conches and the booming,
  reverberant sound of kettledrums—Rāma, the mighty-armed, the conqueror of
  hostile cities, advanced.
'2': >-
  Hearing that tumultuous roar, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, for a moment
  entered into reflection, and then looked toward his ministers.
'3': >-
  Then, addressing all those ministers there, mighty Rāvaṇa—making the whole
  assembly resound—spoke as follows.
'4': >-
  The rākṣasa-lord, cruel and a scourge to the worlds, censured and belittled
  the crossing of this ocean—[calling into question] the valor, strength, and
  manly prowess by which it had been achieved.
'5': >-
  “Whatever you have said concerning Rāma—that I have heard. And I also know you
  to be men of true prowess in battle. Yet, having understood Rāma’s might, you
  look silently at one another.”
'6': >-
  Thereupon the very wise rākṣasa named Mālyavān—Rāvaṇa’s maternal
  grandsire—having heard Rāvaṇa’s words, spoke thus.
'7': >-
  “That king, O King, who is disciplined in the sciences and trained in good
  conduct, who follows the ways of polity—he rules with enduring sovereignty and
  brings even foes under control.
'8': >-
  “For one who, at the proper time, both forms alliances and also undertakes
  hostilities—together with his spies—who causes his own side to grow, attains
  great dominion.
'9': >-
  “When one’s power is declining, a king should make peace with an equal; he
  should not despise an enemy, and should wage war only against one superior [in
  advantage] with due discernment.”
'10': >-
  “Therefore, O Rāvaṇa, peace with Rāma is what commends itself to me. For the
  sake of whom you have been thus assailed—Sītā—let her be given back to him.
'11': >-
  “All the deva-rishis and the gandharvas who seek victory are on his side. Do
  not enter into enmity with him; let peace with him be agreeable to you.
'12': >-
  “Indeed, the Blessed Grandfather (Pitāmaha, Brahmā) brought forth two parties
  alone: of the devas and of the asuras—dharma and adharma resting upon them
  respectively.
'13': >-
  “Dharma is heard of as the party of the deathless great-souled ones; and
  adharma is the party of rākṣasas and of asuras, O Rākṣasa.
'14': >-
  “Dharma verily devours adharma when the Kṛta-yuga has come; and adharma
  devours dharma when the age of Kali (Tishya) is in motion.
'15': >-
  “But as you have ranged through the worlds, even great dharma has been struck
  down by you, and adharma has been seized and upheld; therefore the others have
  grown strong against us.
'16': >-
  “That adharma of yours, having increased through negligence, like a serpent is
  swallowing us; and it is augmenting the side of the devas, becoming a
  benefactor to them.
'17': >-
  “And because you, attached to sense-objects and acting at mere whim, have done
  as you pleased, great agitation has been produced among the sages who are like
  fire.
'18': >-
  “Their power is hard to overcome—like a blazing flame; their inner selves are
  perfected by austerity, and they delight in the favoring of dharma.
'19': >-
  “These twice-born ones perform sacrifice with the chief rites of sacrifice;
  they duly offer oblations into the sacred fires, and they loudly recite and
  study the Vedas.
'20': >-
  “Overpowering the rākṣasas and raising the chants of Brahman, they have driven
  [them] away in all directions—like thunderclouds in the heat of summer driving
  things before them.
'21': >-
  “And the smoke arising from the fire-offerings of those sages, who are like
  fire, spreading through the ten quarters, takes away the splendor of the
  rākṣasas.
'22': >-
  “In this place and in that—indeed in holy regions—by those firm-vowed ones,
  fierce austerity is practiced, and it scorches the rākṣasas.
'23': >-
  “And though you obtained a boon granted you against devas, dānavas, and
  yakṣas, yet men—vānaras, bears, and mighty ‘goat-tailed’ ones—strong and of
  firm valor—have come here and are roaring.
'24': >-
  “Seeing diverse terrible portents—many and of many kinds—I foresee the
  destruction of all the rākṣasas.
'25': >-
  “Clouds, terrible with the braying of asses, and exceedingly frightful, are
  raining hot blood upon Laṅkā from every side.
'26': >-
  “And from the weeping vehicles, drops like tears are falling; dust-stormed and
  discolored, they no longer shine as they did before.
'27': >-
  “Serpents, jackals, and vultures cry out most dreadfully; entering the
  pleasure-groves of Laṅkā, they gather together in swarms.
'28': >-
  “Women—dark in aspect, with pale teeth—stand in front, laughing; in dreams
  they steal away the houses’ prosperity, and also speak ominously.
'29': >-
  “Dogs consume the offerings of the household rites; asses are born among the
  cows, and mice among mongooses.
'30': >-
  “Cats consort with leopards, boars with dogs; kinnaras likewise assemble with
  rākṣasas, and with men.
'31': >-
  “Pale birds with blood-red feet, driven by Time, wander about; even pigeons
  move to and fro for the ruin of the rākṣasas.
'32': >-
  “Mynas perched in the houses, crying ‘cīcīkūcī,’ fall down even in pairs,
  overcome by those that seek to quarrel.
'33': >-
  “And all the birds and beasts cry facing the sun. A dreadful, misshapen,
  shaven-headed man—black and tawny-eyed—[appears as an omen].”
'34': >-
  “Time watches over the houses of all, again and again, in due season; these
  and other wicked portents keep arising.
'35': >-
  “We deem Rāma to be Viṣṇu who has assumed a human form; for that Rāghava of
  steadfast valor is not a mere man.
'36': >-
  “He by whom a causeway has been bound across the sea—that is supremely
  wondrous. Therefore, O Rāvaṇa, make peace with Rāma, king among men. Having
  understood and firmly ascertained the course of actions, let what is to be
  done be done with an eye to what can endure for the future.”
'37': >-
  Having thus spoken these words, Mālyavān, once more examining the lord of the
  rākṣasas’ mind, fell silent—he who was strong, endowed with unsurpassed and
  excellent manly prowess—after regarding Rāvaṇa.
'38': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fifth canto, called “Mālyavān’s Counsel,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
