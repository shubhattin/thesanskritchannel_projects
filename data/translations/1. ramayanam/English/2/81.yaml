  Now begins the eighty-first sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Assembly Hall” (Sabhāsthānam).
'1': >-
  Thereafter, in the latter part of the night, the bards—sūtas and
  māgadhas—skilled in speech, praised Bharata with auspicious, benedictory
  hymns.
'2': >-
  Drums (dundubhis), struck upon their golden rims, were sounded at the
  appointed hours; and conches were blown in their hundreds, and likewise many
  instruments, producing notes both high and low.
'3': >-
  That great roar of musical instruments seemed to fill the very heavens; yet it
  only pierced Bharata, who was scorched by grief, with grief afresh, leaving
  him no interval of relief.
'4': >-
  Then Bharata, awakened, restrained that clamor; and, saying even, “I am not
  the king,” he spoke these words to Śatrughna:
'5': >-
  “Behold, O Śatrughna, the grievous harm done to the world by Kaikeyī: having
  cast sorrows upon me, King Daśaratha has departed (from this life).”
'6': >-
  “For that great-souled king, who was righteous and had dharma as his very
  foundation, the royal fortune now wanders about, as a rudderless boat drifts
  upon the waters.”
'7': >-
  “He who was our mighty lord—he too has been banished to the forest. Through
  her, abandoning dharma, my own mother has herself driven Rāghava away.”
'8': >-
  Seeing Bharata thus, lamenting senselessly, the women all then wept in a
  piteous manner, their cries rising aloud together.
'9': >-
  While he thus lamented, Vasiṣṭha—knower of the duties of kings, and of great
  renown—entered the assembly hall of the lord of the Ikṣvāku line.
'10': >-
  That righteous-souled one, accompanied by his attendants, approached the
  lovely hall, fashioned as though of a hundred golden pitchers, thronged with
  gems and precious stones—like Sudharmā (the celestial assembly hall) itself.
'11': >-
  The knower of all the Vedas sat upon a golden throne, covered with a most
  costly spread; and he directed instructions to the messengers.
'12': >-
  “Bring here quickly and without delay the brāhmaṇas, the kṣatriyas, the
  warriors, the ministers, and the beloved chiefs of the clans. For an urgent
  duty presses upon us.”
'13': >-
  “And also Śatrughna together with the royal servants, and Bharata of fame; and
  Yudhājit; and Sumantra; and those people here who are well-disposed and
  devoted to the welfare of the realm.”
'14': >-
  Then there arose a great tumultuous sound—of people coming in, with chariots,
  with horses, and also with elephants.
'15': >-
  Then, as Bharata approached, the citizens rejoiced in him, as the gods rejoice
  in Śatakratu (Indra); and the subjects greeted him just as they had greeted
  Daśaratha.
'16': >-
  With its waters stilled and clear, and strewn with pearls, conches, and
  gravel—like a lake dense with mighty fish and nāgas—the assembly hall, adorned
  by Daśaratha’s son, shone forth as though Daśaratha himself were present, even
  as in former days.
'17': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-first sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Assembly Hall” (Sabhāsthānam).
