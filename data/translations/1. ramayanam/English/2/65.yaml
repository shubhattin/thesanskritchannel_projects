  Now begins the sixty-fifth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Lamentation within the Inner Apartments
  (Antaḥpura-ākranda).”
'1': >-
  When the night had passed, at early dawn on the following day, the bards
  (vandins) came and stood waiting around that royal residence.
'2': >-
  Charioteers and panegyrists, highly refined and well-trained, auspicious in
  their utterance and learned in excellent lore; and singers devoted to
  praise—each of them separately began to proclaim (their portions).
'3': >-
  As they extolled the king with blessings pronounced in lofty tones, a wide and
  far-spreading sound of eulogy arose through the spacious precincts of the
  palace.
'4': >-
  Then, while those charioteers were praising him, the players of hand-drums and
  other instruments, reciting auspicious compositions, began again to sound
  their rhythmic music.
'5': >-
  Awakened by that sound, the birds cried out in response—those that dwelt upon
  the branches and those kept in cages, accustomed to move within the royal
  household.
'6': >-
  Sacred utterances were spoken, and the reverberation of vīṇās also was heard;
  and the blessings sung in the form of verses and lays filled that entire
  mansion.
'7': >-
  Thereupon, attendants of pure conduct, skilled in service and attendance,
  together with many noble women of mature years, stood ready to wait upon him,
  as had been done before.
'8': >-
  Water mingled with yellow sandal-paste was brought in golden vessels; and,
  according to time and according to prescribed rite, preparations were made for
  the royal bath and its due observances.
'9': >-
  Auspicious articles fit to be taken up and used—things to be drunk and other
  requisites—were brought; and likewise many young maidens (kumārīs) and women
  carried in the remaining items.
'10': >-
  Everything was complete with all the proper marks, and everything was honored
  in accordance with rule; everything was full of good qualities and auspicious
  fortune—everything was prepared for the king’s personal service.
'11': >-
  Up to the time of sunrise all stood in eager expectation, waiting and not yet
  receiving (the king’s appearance), wondering, “What indeed can this be?”
'12': >-
  Then those women who were nearest to the couch of the lord of Kośala
  approached and sought to awaken their husband.
'13': >-
  Yet, though they were ever well-behaved and acted with humility and propriety,
  they could obtain nothing at all—for they did not even dare to touch his bed
  (as before).
'14': >-
  Those women, skilled in discerning the signs of sleep by movements, gestures,
  and the like, were seized with trembling, fearing for the king’s very life.
'15': >-
  They shook, like the tips of grasses quivering against the current; and seeing
  those women trembling, the king (too) appeared as one to be feared for.
'16': >-
  Then the certainty was born that the evil they had suspected had indeed come
  to pass: Kauśalyā and Sumitrā were overcome by grief for their sons.
'17': >-
  Though lying asleep, they did not awaken at the proper time as was their wont;
  lusterless and pale, they were bowed down, sunk and crushed beneath sorrow.
'18': >-
  Kauśalyā did not shine forth—like a star veiled by darkness. Next to the king
  lay Sumitrā.
'19': >-
  Even the goddess-like Sumitrā did not gleam, her face drenched and disfigured
  by tears of grief. And when they beheld both those auspicious queens and that
  king lying thus,
'20': >-
  the women of the inner apartments thought, “He sleeps, but his life-breath has
  departed.” Then those excellent ladies wailed aloud in misery, raising their
  voices in lamentation.
'21': >-
  Like female elephants in the forest whose leader has fallen away and been
  driven from his place, they cried; and by the sound of their wailing,
  consciousness suddenly arose (in the palace) everywhere.
'22': >-
  Kauśalyā and Sumitrā, abandoning sleep, awoke; and both, seeing the king and
  touching him,
'23': cried out again and again, “Alas, my lord!” and fell upon the ground.
'24': >-
  That daughter of the lord of Kośala (Kauśalyā), writhing upon the earth, did
  not shine—like a star fallen from the sky, dulled and covered with dust. When
  the king of tranquil virtues had departed, Kauśalyā lay prostrate on the
  ground.
'25': >-
  Seeing all those women like she-elephants whose lord has been slain, then all
  the king’s consorts—headed by Kaikeyī—
'26': >-
  weeping and scorched by sorrow, fell down senseless. A mighty cry arose,
  driven onward by the wailing women,
'27': and it made that whole palace resound all the more.
'28': >-
  The place became frightened and confused, crowded with people in anxious
  haste—everywhere a tumult of lamentation, the burning anguish of afflicted
  kinsmen; joy collapsed at once into misery, and the sight was wretched and
  unsteady.
'29': >-
  Such was the abode of the divine king when he had reached the end ordained by
  destiny. When the queens learned that the bull among kings, the glorious one,
  had passed away, they surrounded him with all their attendants; weeping
  bitterly and pitifully, plunged in intense grief, they lifted up their arms
  and lamented like women bereft of all refuge.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fifth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, called “The Lamentation within the Inner Apartments
  (Antaḥpura-ākranda).”
