  Now begins the seventeenth chapter in the Yuddha Kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Petition of Vibhīṣaṇa Seeking Refuge.”
'1': >-
  Having thus spoken harsh words to Rāvaṇa, Rāvaṇa’s younger brother set out;
  and within a short while he came to the place where Rāma stood with Lakṣmaṇa.
'2': >-
  The leaders of the vānaras, though standing on the earth, beheld him in the
  sky—like the peak of Mount Meru, shining as it were like a blazing mass of
  fire.
'3': >-
  And his attendants too—four warriors of dreadful prowess—were there; they also
  were furnished with armor and weapons, adorned with the choicest ornaments.
'4': >-
  And he himself, resembling a dark mountain-cloud, radiant like the thunderbolt
  as a weapon, was a heroic bearer of excellent arms, adorned with divine
  ornaments.
'5': >-
  Seeing him approaching with those four as his fifth, Sugrīva, lord of the
  vānaras—hard to assail and wise—began to deliberate along with the vānaras.
'6': >-
  After thinking for a moment, he addressed those vānaras—Hanumān and all the
  rest—with these weighty words.
'7': >-
  “Behold! This rākṣasa, fully equipped with every weapon, is coming with four
  other rākṣasas. Without doubt he comes to slay us.”
'8': >-
  Hearing Sugrīva’s words, all those foremost of vānaras, lifting up sāla-trees
  and boulders and mountain-peaks, spoke these words:
'9': >-
  “Command us quickly, O king, for the killing of these evil-minded ones, before
  those men of little sense—when struck down—fall upon the ground!”
'10': >-
  While they were thus speaking among themselves, Vibhīṣaṇa reached the farther
  bank and remained there, still poised in the sky.
'11': >-
  Then Vibhīṣaṇa—great in stature and of very great wisdom—looking upon Sugrīva
  and those others, spoke in a loud voice while still in the air.
'12': >-
  “There is a rākṣasa of wicked conduct named Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas. I am
  his younger brother, known by the name Vibhīṣaṇa.”
'13': >-
  “By him Sītā was carried off from Janasthāna, after slaying Jaṭāyu; and she is
  imprisoned—helpless and sorrowful—carefully guarded by rākṣasī-women.”
'14': >-
  “I pointed out to him again and again, with reasoned words in many ways: ‘Let
  Sītā be sent forth—restore her to Rāma; this is right.’”
'15': >-
  “But Rāvaṇa, driven by Time (fate), did not accept it—though it was wholesome
  counsel—like a man who takes medicine as if it were something contrary and
  harmful.”
'16': >-
  “Thus I, abused by him and dishonored like a servant, abandoning even my sons
  and my wife, have come seeking refuge in Rāghava.”
'17': >-
  “Inform Rāghava swiftly—Rāghava of great soul, the refuge of all worlds—that
  Vibhīṣaṇa has come and stands here.”
'18': >-
  Hearing these words, Sugrīva, swift in valor, spoke this—standing before
  Lakṣmaṇa—to Rāma, who was now wrathful.
'19': >-
  “Having entered the enemy host, an enemy has come here unperceived; finding an
  opening, he may slay us—like an owl striking crows.”
'20': >-
  “You should be vigilant in counsel, in battle-array, in policy, and in
  espionage—may it be well with you, O tormentor of foes—and with the vānaras as
  well.”
'21': >-
  “For these rākṣasas, able to assume any form, go about in concealment; they
  are brave and skilled in deceit—never should one trust them.”
'22': >-
  “This may be an agent planted by Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas; infiltrating
  among us, he would sow dissension—there is no doubt.”
'23': >-
  “Or else, being himself intelligent, having found some flaw, he might enter
  among us and—once trust is gained—strike at some time.”
'24': >-
  “Therefore let all our forces be assembled—the allies’ forest-forces and the
  troops of hereditary servants—everything; only the enemy’s strength is to be
  excluded.”
'25': >-
  “By nature he is a rākṣasa, and the brother of a foe who is our enemy; he has
  come as an enemy in person—how can one trust him in this matter?”
'26': >-
  “He is renowned as Vibhīṣaṇa, younger brother of Rāvaṇa; with four other
  rākṣasas he has come seeking your refuge.”
'27': >-
  “Know him to be sent by Rāvaṇa; and I deem it proper, O best of the
  forbearing, to restrain him.”
'28': >-
  “This rākṣasa has come here, instructed with crooked intent—concealed by
  illusion—in order to strike when you, O faultless one, have come to trust
  him.”
'29': >-
  “Let him be slain with severe punishment, along with his companions; for this
  is Vibhīṣaṇa, brother of the cruel Rāvaṇa.”
'30': >-
  Having thus spoken to Rāma, the commander of the host—enraged, yet a knower of
  words and skilled in speech—thereupon fell silent.
'31': >-
  But hearing Sugrīva’s words, mighty Rāma said this to the monkeys who stood
  near—Hanumān and the rest.
'32': >-
  “What was said by the king of monkeys concerning Rāvaṇa’s younger
  brother—words exceedingly full of reason—you too have heard.”
'33': >-
  “In times of hardship, it is always fitting for the wise—and for one who is
  capable and who desires enduring prosperity—to counsel and advise his
  friends.”
'34': >-
  Thus questioned, those vānaras, unwearied, each set forth his own opinion,
  speaking respectfully to Rāma, wishing to do what was pleasing to him.
'35': >-
  “Nothing is unknown to you, O Rāghava, in the three worlds. Yet, honoring us,
  O Rāma, you ask us out of friendliness.”
'36': >-
  “For you are steadfast in truth, heroic, righteous, firm in valor; you examine
  before acting, are mindful, unreserved with your very self, and devoted to
  your friends.”
'37': >-
  “Therefore let your counselors speak, one by one—endowed with reasoning and
  sound judgment—able to state their view again and again.”
'38': >-
  When this was said to Rāghava, wise Aṅgada, standing in front, spoke these
  words in order to test Vibhīṣaṇa.
'39': >-
  “Having come from the presence of the enemy, he is in every way to be
  suspected; Vibhīṣaṇa should not be trusted at once.”
'40': >-
  “For men of deceitful mind conceal their true disposition as they move about,
  and they strike where there is an opening; from that, a very great calamity
  may arise.”
'41': >-
  “Having determined what is advantageous and what is not, one should undertake
  a course of action; one should accept on the basis of virtues, but reject on
  the basis of faults.”
'42': >-
  “If there is a great fault in him, let him be abandoned without hesitation;
  or, knowing many virtues, let him be accepted, O king.”
'43': >-
  Then Śarabha, having reached a conclusion, spoke a meaningful statement:
  “Quickly, O tiger among men, let counter-espionage be set in motion concerning
  him.”
'44': >-
  “For, placing spies—rightly and with subtle intelligence—and then examining
  him, acceptance should be undertaken according to what is just.”
'45': >-
  Then Jāmbavān, discerning with the intelligence of the śāstras, looking on,
  submitted words full of merit and free from fault.
'46': >-
  “Because of his bound enmity and the wickedness of the rākṣasa-lord, Vibhīṣaṇa
  has come at an untimely moment; in every way this one should be suspected.”
'47': >-
  Then Mainda, skilled in sound policy and its opposite, eloquent in speech,
  spoke words that were even more reasoned.
'48': >-
  “This man is Vibhīṣaṇa, the younger brother of Rāvaṇa. Let him be questioned
  gently and gradually, O lord of kings.”
'49': >-
  “Having truly understood his intention, you will then decide, O bull among
  men, with deliberation, whether he is wicked or not.”
'50': >-
  Then Hanumān, the foremost of ministers, refined by good training, spoke words
  that were gentle, meaningful, sweet, and brief.
'51': >-
  “Even Bृहaspati himself, speaking, would not be able to surpass you—best in
  understanding, capable, and the foremost among speakers.”
'52': >-
  “Not from disputation, nor from contention, nor from a desire to outdo, nor
  from self-will, O king, shall I speak; I shall speak what is true, out of
  reverence for Rāma.”
'53': >-
  “In what has been said by your counselors, regarding the causes of benefit and
  harm, I see a fault: the proposed course of action is not, in fact, feasible.”
'54': >-
  “Without assigning a task, one cannot ascertain capability; yet to employ
  someone suddenly also appears to me as fault-laden.”
'55': >-
  “What your counselors said—that spies should be set—sounds appropriate; but
  because the intended object cannot truly be accomplished, even there the
  rationale does not hold.”
'56': >-
  “As to this statement, ‘Vibhīṣaṇa has come at an untimely moment,’ I have
  something to say; understand it from me according to my judgment.”
'57': >-
  “This place and this time are as they are here; and likewise, from person to
  person, both faults and virtues also vary.”
'58': >-
  “Seeing the wickedness in Rāvaṇa, and your prowess as well, his coming here is
  fitting—indeed, it accords with his understanding.”
'59': >-
  “And as for what was said—‘Let him be questioned by men of unknown
  appearance,’ O king—about this too I have considered a certain point.”
'60': >-
  “A wise man, when suddenly questioned, might grow suspicious in his speech; in
  that case, a friend who has come in good faith, being falsely interrogated,
  may be estranged.”
'61': >-
  “It is not possible, all at once, to understand another’s inner disposition, O
  king, without observing well the signs—differences of tone and the like—with
  great skill.”
'62': >-
  “But in his speech no wicked intent is ever perceived; and his face too is
  serene—therefore I have no doubt.”
'63': >-
  “One whose mind is free of suspicion, who is composed, does not slink about as
  a deceiver; nor is there in him any wickedness of speech—therefore I have no
  doubt.”
'64': >-
  “Even when a person tries to conceal it, outward demeanor cannot be hidden;
  for it forcibly reveals the inner feeling of men.”
'65': >-
  “And an undertaking that is appropriate to place and time, O best of those who
  know what is to be done, quickly becomes fruitful when executed with
  well-directed effort.”
'66': >-
  “Seeing your exertion, and the false conduct of Rāvaṇa, and hearing that Vāli
  was slain and Sugrīva anointed,”},{
'67': >-
  “—seeking a kingdom—he has come here with deliberation. Considering just this
  much as his motive, it is proper to accept him.”},{
'68': >-
  “Thus far have I spoken, to the best of my ability, concerning the rākṣasa’s
  straightforwardness. You are the authority for what remains, O best of the
  wise, having heard all.”},{
'69': >-
  Thus ends the seventeenth chapter in the Yuddha Kāṇḍa of the revered
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Petition of Vibhīṣaṇa Seeking
  Refuge.”
