  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  seventy-fifth sarga, entitled “The Inquiry into Śambūka.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those nectar-like words of Nārada, Rāma at that time obtained
  immeasurable delight, and he spoke these words to Lakṣmaṇa:
'2': >-
  “Go, dear one; console that foremost of twice-born brāhmaṇas, a man of
  excellent vows. And place the body of that boy in a trough filled with oil.”
'3': >-
  “With exceedingly noble perfumes and with fragrant oils as well, arrange it,
  dear one, in such a manner that the boy’s body does not decay.”
'4': >-
  “So act that the boy’s body—kept protected and preserved according to proper
  and prescribed observances—may suffer neither mishap nor injury nor any
  disfigurement.”
'5': >-
  Having thus instructed Lakṣmaṇa of auspicious marks, that Kakutstha of great
  renown then, in his mind, summoned the Puṣpaka, saying, “Come!”
'6': >-
  Understanding his intention, the Puṣpaka—adorned with gold—came within a
  moment into the presence of Rāghava.
'7': >-
  Bowing low, it spoke: “I am here, O lord of men. I am under your control, O
  mighty-armed one; your attendant has come and stands ready.”
'8': >-
  Hearing the pleasing speech of the Puṣpaka, the lord of men paid reverence to
  those great ṛṣis, and then mounted that aerial car.
'9': >-
  Taking up his bow, and his quivers, and his sword of shining splendor, and
  leaving behind in the city the two heroes—Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) and Bharata—
'10': >-
  He set out toward the western quarter, ranging here and there in search, and
  then the illustrious king went to the northern region, encompassed by the
  Himavat.
'11': >-
  Seeing there not even the slightest unrighteous deed, the lord of men then
  looked also toward the entire eastern quarter.
'12': >-
  Seated in the Puṣpaka, the mighty-armed lord of men then beheld that region to
  be of thoroughly pure conduct, as spotless as a mirror’s surface.
'13': >-
  Thereafter, the son of the royal sage advanced to the southern direction; on
  the northern side of the Śaivala mountain, he beheld a very great lake.
'14': >-
  In that lake Rāghava, the illustrious one, saw an ascetic engaged in
  austerities of very great penance—hanging with his head downward, suspended
  upside down.
'15': >-
  Approaching that ascetic who was practicing the highest tapas, Rāghava then
  spoke these words: “Blessed are you, O man of excellent vows.”
'16': >-
  “Of what birth are you, O one advanced in austerities—O steadfast in valor?
  Out of curiosity I ask you; for I am Rāma, the son of Daśaratha.”
'17': >-
  “What purpose have you resolved upon—attainment of heaven, or something else
  supreme? Under what desired refuge and for what reason do you undertake this
  exceedingly difficult austerity? I wish to hear, O ascetic, upon what ground
  this tapas has been performed.”
'18': >-
  “Are you a brāhmaṇa? Blessings to you. Or are you an unconquerable kṣatriya?
  Or are you a vaiśya of the third varṇa? Or are you a śūdra? Speak the truth.”
'19': >-
  Thus addressed by the lord of men, with head still bent down, he spoke to that
  Daśarathi—declaring to the foremost of kings his birth, and also the reason
  for his strenuous endeavor in austerities.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-fifth sarga, entitled “The Inquiry into Śambūka,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
