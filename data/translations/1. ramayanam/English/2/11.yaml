  Now begins the eleventh chapter of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Binding Claim upon the Two Boons.”
'1': >-
  Then Kaikeyī spoke harsh words to that protector of the earth—him who had been
  pierced by the arrows of the God of Love, and who was being swept along under
  the force of desire.
'2': >-
  O lord, I have not been wronged, nor have I been slighted or insulted by
  anyone; but there is a certain intention of mine—I desire that it be fulfilled
  by you.
'3': >-
  Acknowledge a promise, if you truly wish to do so; then I shall tell you what
  has been sought by me in accordance with my desire.
'4': >-
  The great king said to Kaikeyī with a faint smile; and, being enamoured, he
  took her by the hand as she lay upon the ground with her hair dishevelled.
'5': >-
  O proud one, do you not know that for me there is no man dearer than
  you—except Rāma, that tiger among men? Indeed, other than Rāma, no such man
  exists.
'6': >-
  By that invincible, foremost, great-souled Rāghava I swear to you—by his very
  life that is worthy to be lived—tell me what your heart longs for.
'7': >-
  For the moment that I should not behold him, surely I would not live. By that
  very Rāma, O Kaikeyī, I swear to you: your word shall be made good—your
  request shall be carried out.
'8': >-
  That bull among men whom I choose for myself, for my sons, and for the others
  as well—by that Rāma, O Kaikeyī, I swear to you: your word shall be fulfilled.
'9': >-
  O auspicious lady, reflect upon this even in your heart and then draw it forth
  for me; having considered it well, O Kaikeyī, tell me what you deem proper.
'10': >-
  Seeing your own strength, you ought not to harbour any doubt. I shall bring
  about your satisfaction; even by my merit I swear it to you.
'11': >-
  The queen, her mind fixed upon that very purpose, and seeing his intention
  thus arrived, then—out of obstinacy and out of delight—uttered cruel and
  wicked words.
'12': >-
  Rejoicing at those words and at his disposition, she spoke forth her own
  intent—most dreadful, as though Death himself had come near.
'13': >-
  As you swear in due order and also grant my boon, let the Thirty-Three gods,
  with Indra at their head, hear this.
'14': >-
  Let the Moon and the Sun, the sky, the planets, night and day, and the
  quarters of the world hear it; and let this entire universe, and this earth,
  together with Gandharvas and Rākṣasas, bear witness.
'15': >-
  Let the nocturnal beings, the spirits, and the household deities within the
  homes—indeed whatever other beings there are who may know your spoken
  word—hear it as well.
'16': >-
  This king is steadfast in truth, of great splendour, knower of dharma, a
  speaker of truth and pure in conduct; let all the deities hear that he is
  granting me a boon.
'17': >-
  Thus the queen, taking hold of the mighty archer and addressing him, then
  spoke to that grantor of boons who was deluded by desire.
'18': >-
  Remember, O king, what happened long ago in that battle between the gods and
  the Asuras: there your enemy struck you down, and your life was in peril.
'19': >-
  And there, O lord, I kept watch and strove, and by me you were protected;
  therefore, in that time, you granted me two boons.
'20': >-
  Those two boons that were granted, O lord—those deposits I now seek to claim
  from you, O protector of the earth, O delight of the Raghu line.
'21': >-
  If, after having pledged in accordance with dharma, you will not give me the
  boon, then this very day—dishonoured by you—I shall abandon my life.
'22': >-
  Then the king, brought under Kaikeyī’s control by mere words, rushed headlong
  toward ruin—like a deer running into the snare for its own destruction.
'23': >-
  Then she further spoke to that bestower of boons, deluded by desire: “Two
  boons must be given by you, O lord—those that were granted then, O king.”
'24': >-
  Those two I shall state this very day. Hear my words: the preparations for
  Rāghava’s consecration have been set in motion.
'25': >-
  By this very consecration let my Bharata be anointed. This is the second boon,
  O lord, which you granted me when you were pleased with me.
'26': >-
  That time in the war between gods and Asuras—its moment has now arrived: for
  nine and five years let him dwell in the Daṇḍaka forest.
'27': >-
  Let resolute Rāma, wearing bark garments and antelope-skin, become an ascetic;
  and let Bharata today enjoy the princely regency, free from thorns—without any
  hindrance.
'28': >-
  This is my supreme desire; I choose the very boon that has been granted. And
  today itself may I behold Rāghava departing to the forest.
'29': >-
  O king of kings, be true to your oath in battle; protect your lineage, your
  character, and your noble birth. For concerning the abode hereafter, the sages
  rich in austerity declare that for men nothing is higher than speech that is
  truthful and beneficial.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the eleventh chapter of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic, entitled “The Binding Claim upon the Two Boons.”
