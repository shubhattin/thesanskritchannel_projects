  Janaka,” in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.

  When that night had passed, King Daśaratha—together with his family and his
  preceptor—rejoicing, spoke these words to Sumantra:
'2': >-
  “Today let all the treasurers, having taken abundant wealth, proceed ahead,
  properly arranged, furnished with many kinds of jewels.
'3': >-
  “And let the fourfold army also set out at once on every side. Let my most
  excellent and fully equipped vehicle also be made ready at the same time,
  according to my command.
'4': >-
  “Let Vasiṣṭha, and Vāmadeva, and Jābāli, and likewise Kaśyapa; and Mārkaṇḍeya,
  the long-lived sage, and also Kātyāyana—
'5': >-
  “—these twice-born foremost ones go in front. Harness my chariot, so that
  there may be no loss of time; for the messengers are urging me to haste.”
'6': >-
  At the word of the lord of men, the fourfold army too followed behind the king
  as he proceeded, together with the sages.
'7': >-
  Having travelled for four days on the road, he approached the Videhas. And the
  illustrious King Janaka, on hearing of it, made preparations to honor him.
'8': >-
  Then, having come to the aged King Daśaratha, the delighted King Janaka
  attained supreme joy.
'9': >-
  The best of kings spoke to the best of men, who was filled with gladness:
  “Welcome to you, O best of men! By good fortune you have arrived, O Rāghava.
'10': >-
  “You shall obtain the affection of both my daughters, won by valor. By good
  fortune the most radiant, venerable sage Vasiṣṭha has arrived—
'11': >-
  “—together with all the foremost among the twice-born, like Indra of a hundred
  sacrifices along with the gods. By good fortune my obstacles have been
  overcome; by good fortune my lineage has been honored.
'12': >-
  “Since there is to be a bond with the Rāghavas—supreme in prowess and of great
  might—you, O lord of men, should tomorrow at daybreak be pleased to bring the
  matter to completion,”
'13': >-
  —“the marriage, at the conclusion of the sacrifice,” (as ordained) by the best
  of sages. Hearing those words, the king among men, in the midst of the sages,
'14': >-
  the best among those skilled in speech, replied to the lord of the earth:
  “Acceptance rests in the power of the giver—this I have heard before.
'15': >-
  “As you shall say, O knower of dharma, so shall we do. Such is the righteous
  and fame-bestowing word of you who speak the truth.”
'16': >-
  Hearing this, the lord of Videha was seized with great amazement. Then all the
  hosts of sages, in their mutual gathering,
'17': filled with great delight, spent that night happily.
'18': >-
  Then Rāma, of great splendor, went together with Lakṣmaṇa, placing Viśvāmitra
  at the fore, and touched his father’s feet in reverence.
'19': >-
  And the king, beholding his two sons, the Rāghavas, was exceedingly gladdened;
  and, highly delighted, he stayed, honored by Janaka.
'20': >-
  Janaka too, of great splendor, a knower of the true nature of dharma, having
  duly attended—according to righteous ordinance—to the rites of the sacrifice
  and to his daughters as well, spent that night there.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-ninth chapter, called “The Meeting of Dasharatha and
  Janaka,” in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the foremost epic.
