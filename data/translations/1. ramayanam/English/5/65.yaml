'0': >-
  Then, in the holy and glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-fifth canto, named “The Bestowal of the Crest-Jewel (Cūḍāmaṇi).”
'1': >-
  Thereupon, those vānaras went to mount Prasravaṇa, rich with variegated woods;
  and bowing with their heads, they paid reverence to Rāma and to mighty-armed
  Lakṣmaṇa.
'2': >-
  Placing Sugrīva, the heir-apparent, at the fore, and saluting him as well,
  they then began to relate the tidings concerning Sītā.
'3': >-
  They described her confinement within Rāvaṇa’s inner apartments, and the
  threats hurled at her by the rākṣasīs; they also told of her abiding love for
  Rāma, and of the resolve and vow she had made.
'4': >-
  Having thus reported all of this, the monkeys, in Rāma’s very presence—when he
  heard that Vaidehī was uninjured—then Rāma spoke in reply.
'5': >-
  “Where does the goddess Sītā dwell now, and in what manner does she hold her
  mind in me? Tell me all of this, O vānaras, with reference to Vaidehī.”
'6': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, the monkeys in Rāma’s presence urged on Hanumān, who was
  skilled in recounting the full account of Sītā.
'7': >-
  But hearing their words, Hanumān, the son of the Wind-god, bowed his head in
  reverence toward that direction where the goddess Sītā was, and then spoke.
'8': >-
  That knower of fitting speech spoke words describing how the sight of Sītā had
  been obtained; and he presented that divine golden jewel, radiant with its own
  splendor.
'9': >-
  Having given that jewel to Rāma, Hanumān then spoke with joined palms:
  “Leaping across the ocean, which extends a hundred yojanas…
'10': >-
  …I went in search of Jānakī Sītā, desiring to behold her. There I found the
  city called Laṅkā, belonging to the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa.
'11': >-
  It lies on the southern shore of the southern sea. There Sītā was seen by me,
  dwelling within Rāvaṇa’s inner palace.
'12': >-
  Living only by entrusting her life to you, O Rāma—fixing her heart upon Rāma,
  her one desire—she was seen by me in the midst of rākṣasīs, being threatened
  again and again.
'13': >-
  Guarded by hideous rākṣasīs in the grove of Aśoka-trees, the देवी—she who is
  worthy of happiness with you, O hero—has fallen into grief.
'14': >-
  Imprisoned within Rāvaṇa’s inner palace and closely guarded by rākṣasīs, she
  was wretched, wearing her hair in a single braid, wholly intent upon thought
  of you.
'15': >-
  Lying upon the bare ground, her limbs bereft of color, like a lotus-plant in
  the coming of winter, turning away from all desire toward Rāvaṇa, she had
  resolved upon death.
'16': >-
  O Kakutstha, somehow I discovered the देवी, her mind fixed on you; and, O
  sinless one, I softly recounted the renowned glory of the Ikṣvāku line.
'17': >-
  Then, O tiger among men, I gradually won her trust; thereafter I spoke with
  the goddess, and made known to her the whole matter and its meaning.
'18': >-
  Hearing of the friendship between Rāma and Sugrīva, she attained delight. Her
  conduct is ever disciplined and proper, and her devotion to you is constant.
'19': >-
  Thus, O greatly fortunate one, I beheld the daughter of Janaka—endowed with
  stern austerity and sustained by devotion to you, O bull among men.
'20': >-
  And she gave me a token of recognition to be brought to you, O great-minded
  Rāghava—concerning what befell at Citrakūṭa, with regard to the crow.
'21': >-
  “Again you must inform this Rāma, O son of the Wind, in full, exactly as you
  have seen,”—so Jānakī spoke to me.
'22': >-
  “And this must be given to him, carefully, being well guarded,”—so she said,
  while thus speaking, with Sugrīva listening nearby.
'23': >-
  “This auspicious and splendid cūḍāmaṇi I have carefully preserved for you.
  Remember the tilaka-mark made of red arsenic (manaḥśilā),” she said.
'24': >-
  “This auspicious jewel—born of the waters—has been sent forth by me for you.
  Seeing it, I shall rejoice, O sinless one, as though beholding you amid my
  calamity.”
'25': >-
  “I shall sustain my life for a month, O son of Daśaratha; beyond a month I
  would not live, having come under the power of the rākṣasas.”
'26': >-
  Thus Sītā spoke to me—slender-limbed, righteous in conduct—shut up within
  Rāvaṇa’s inner palace, her eyes wide like those of a frightened doe.
'27': >-
  This is exactly what I have reported—everything, O Rāghava, as it occurred. By
  every means let a passage across the ocean-waters now be contrived.
'28': >-
  Then those two princes, their hearts relieved, on learning this and on
  receiving from Hanumān that token for Rāghava, heard in full, in due order,
  all that had been told by the goddess—completely, in words—just as the son of
  the Wind proclaimed it.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fifth canto of Sundara-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the primeval epic, named “The Bestowal of the Crest-Jewel (Cūḍāmaṇi).”
