  Now begins the tenth canto, named “The Pacification (Entreaty) of Kaikeyi,” in
  the Ayodhya Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. (2-10)
'1': >-
  When the goddess (Kaikeyi) had been vehemently goaded on and incited by that
  crooked-backed, sinful woman (Mantharā), then she lay upon the ground, like a
  Kiṃnarī pierced and scorched by poison.
'2': >-
  Having firmly resolved in her mind, “This indeed is the proper course,” that
  discerning lady gradually disclosed everything to Mantharā.
'3': >-
  That fair woman—wretched, having formed her resolve, and deluded by Mantharā’s
  words—heaved a long, hot sigh, like a Nāga-maiden.
'4': >-
  For a moment she reflected upon a means that would bring about her own
  pleasure and advantage; and Mantharā—desiring her friend’s welfare and her own
  ends—hearing that resolve, became sure of success.
'5': >-
  Mantharā became exceedingly pleased, as though she had attained her desired
  accomplishment. Then the queen, having grown wrathful and having properly
  fixed her decision,
'6': >-
  though a woman of delicate frame, sat down upon the ground, setting a deep
  frown upon her face. Thereupon the wonderful garlands and the divine
  ornaments,
'7': cast away by Kaikeyi, fell down upon the earth.
'8': >-
  Those garlands and ornaments, flung away by her, made the earth gleam—like
  stars adorning the sky. Fallen in the chamber of wrath, she appeared with her
  raiment soiled.
'9': >-
  Binding her hair into a single, tight braid, she lay as if bereft of spirit,
  like a Kiṃnarī. (Meanwhile) the great king, having commanded the consecration
  of Rāghava (Rāma),
'10': >-
  and having granted permission for the attendants to withdraw, entered his own
  residence, thinking, “Today, indeed, Rāma’s consecration is to be publicly
  celebrated.”
'11': >-
  Eager to announce what was dear to his beloved queen, the self-controlled king
  entered the inner apartments. That greatly renowned monarch entered Kaikeyi’s
  excellent dwelling,
'12': >-
  which—like the sky with the moon obscured by Rāhu—seemed pale and overcast;
  where parrots and peacocks were gathered, and where the cries of krauñca birds
  and the calls of swans resounded,
'13': >-
  echoing with the sound of musical instruments, and thronged with maidservants
  and dwarfish women; adorned with vine-bowers and wondrous halls, beautified
  with campaka and aśoka blossoms,
'14': >-
  furnished with platforms inlaid with ivory, silver, and gold; embellished with
  ponds, and with trees ever bearing flowers and fruits,
'15': >-
  enclosed with superb seats made of ivory, silver, and gold; and well-supplied
  with various kinds of food and drink, and with diverse delicacies,
'16': >-
  and enriched with precious ornaments—like unto the very heaven of the gods.
  Having thus entered his prosperous inner palace,
'17': >-
  the king did not see Kaikeyi upon the excellent bed. Endowed with the force of
  desire and seeking dalliance, the lord of men,
'18': >-
  not beholding his beloved wife, questioned (the attendants) and sank into
  dejection; for never before had the queen remained past that accustomed time.
'19': >-
  Nor had the king ever entered that house when it was empty. Therefore, having
  come into the chambers, the king inquired after Kaikeyi,
'20': >-
  not understanding her as one who sought her own advantage, nor as undiscerning
  as she then became. Then the doorkeeper, frightened, spoke with joined palms:
'21': >-
  “O lord, the queen, exceedingly angry, has run into the chamber of wrath.”
  Hearing the doorkeeper’s words, the king became deeply distressed,
'22': >-
  and again sank down, his senses agitated and bewildered. There he saw her
  fallen on the ground, lying in a manner not befitting her,
'23': >-
  as though scorched by sorrow—the lord of the earth beheld her thus. He, though
  aged, saw his young wife, dearer to him even than life-breath,
'24': >-
  he—sinless—beheld upon the earth one whose intentions had turned sinful: like
  a creeper uprooted and cast down, like a deity fallen (from her seat),
'25': >-
  like a Kiṃnarī driven away, like an apsaras fallen from heaven; like an
  illusion gone astray, like a doe held fast and restrained,
'26': >-
  like a female elephant scorched and pierced by a hunter in the forest; like a
  mighty elephant in the wilderness, grievously afflicted through affection (for
  her).
'27': >-
  Rubbing her gently with both hands, his mind greatly alarmed, the king—full of
  desire—spoke to that lotus-eyed lady:
'28': >-
  “I do not understand any anger of yours that is directed against me. O queen,
  by whom have you been assailed? By whom have you been insulted?”
'29': >-
  “O auspicious one, for my sorrow you lie upon the dust. Why do you lie upon
  the ground, when I am well-disposed toward you and ever intent on your
  welfare?”
'30': >-
  “As though your mind were struck by some malignant influence—O you who shake
  and torment my heart—my skilled physicians are here, and they are in every way
  devoted to you.
'31': >-
  They will make you well and at ease; declare your ailment, O irate one. For
  whom should something dear be done, or by whom has something displeasing been
  done?”
'32': >-
  “Who today is to obtain what is pleasing, and who is to receive some very
  great displeasure? Do not weep, O queen, and do not make yourself waste away.”
'33': >-
  “Who, being inviolable, should be slain? Or who, though fit to be slain,
  should be set free? Who that is poor should become wealthy, or who that is
  wealthy should become destitute?”
'34': >-
  “I, and all who are mine, are obedient to your command. I do not have the
  heart to thwart any intention of yours.
'35': >-
  Even by my own life, speak what rests in your mind. Knowing your own power,
  you ought not to suspect me.”
'36': >-
  “I shall fulfill what is pleasing to you—even I swear it by your merit. As
  long as the wheel (of sovereignty) continues to turn, so long shall this earth
  be mine (to grant).”
'37': >-
  “The Drāviḍas, the Sindhu-Sauvīras, the Saurāṣṭras, the peoples of the
  Southern Road; the Vangas, Angas, Magadhas, Matsyas; and the prosperous Kāśi
  and Kosala realms—”
'38': >-
  “From those regions arise abundant riches—gold and goods, grain and stores,
  goats and sheep. Therefore, O Kaikeyi, choose whatever you desire in your
  heart.”
'39': >-
  “Why this hardship for you, timid one? Rise, rise, O lovely lady. Tell me
  truly, O Kaikeyi, whence this fear has come upon you; that I shall dispel for
  you, like the sun dispersing mist.”
'40': >-
  Thus addressed, she—reassured, yet wishing to speak what was displeasing—began
  once more to set about tormenting her husband.
'41': >-
  Thus ends the tenth canto, named “The Pacification (Entreaty) of Kaikeyi,” in
  the Ayodhya Kāṇḍa of the holy, glorious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the
  foremost poem. (2-10)
