  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa,
  begins the fifty-third chapter, named “The Despondency of Aṅgada and the
  Others.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon they beheld the dreadful ocean, the abode of Varuṇa—boundless,
  loudly roaring, and churned into terror by its formidable waves.
'2': >-
  While searching for Māyā’s mountain-fortress fashioned by enchantment, that
  full month elapsed—the very time-limit which had been fixed by the king.
'3': >-
  At the foot of the Vindhya mountain, amid trees that had burst into blossom,
  those great-souled forest-dwellers sat down, and then fell into anxious
  thought.
'4': >-
  Then, seeing the springtime trees—covered all around with hundreds of
  creepers, their branches bowed down by the heavy load of blossoms—they became
  filled with fear and misgiving.
'5': >-
  Informing one another that spring had arrived—(and realizing) that their
  appointed time for delivering tidings had been lost—they cast themselves down
  upon the earth.
'6': >-
  Then, addressing those aged and disciplined monkeys, the
  forest-dwellers—speaking in sweet words and duly offering respectful
  counsel—(prepared them to hear).
'7': >-
  Thereupon that monkey Aṅgada—broad-shouldered like a lion or a mighty bull,
  with full and massive arms, the wise prince-regent—spoke these words:
'8': >-
  By the command of the lord of monkeys we all set out. Yet the month is now
  complete—why do we, the monkeys who have remained in these caves and
  hiding-places, not take heed (of what is due)?
'9': >-
  We set forth in the month of Āśvayuja, with the time duly reckoned and fixed;
  that (month) also has passed away. What, then, is to be done hereafter?
'10': >-
  You all are men of proved fidelity, skilled in the path of right policy;
  devoted to the welfare of your lord, you were entrusted with every task.
'11': >-
  All of you are peerless in actions, famed in every quarter for your prowess.
  Urged on by the tawny-eyed (Sugrīva), you set out with me at your head.
'12': >-
  Now, for us who have not accomplished our purpose, death is the only course—of
  this there is no doubt. Having failed to carry out the message of the king of
  monkeys, who could ever be happy?
'13': >-
  Since the time has thus passed—and the limit was fixed by Sugrīva
  himself—undertaking a fast unto death is fitting for all the forest-dwellers.
'14': >-
  Sugrīva is harsh by nature and stands firm in the authority of a master; he
  will not pardon any of us who return as offenders.
'15': >-
  And if there is no progress in the search for Sītā, we shall only be doing
  sin. Therefore it is proper even today to go and sit in fast unto death.
'16': >-
  Having abandoned sons and wives, wealth and homes, surely the king will
  destroy us all when we return there.
'17': >-
  Better for us to die here itself than to suffer a disgraceful execution. Nor
  was I installed in the regency by Sugrīva.
'18': >-
  I was anointed by the lord of men, Rāma, whose deeds are unwearied. He, having
  formerly been bound by enmity toward me, on seeing my transgression,
'19': >-
  will have me slain with severe punishment, being resolute in his decision. Why
  should I prolong life while my friends look on at my calamity? Here itself,
  upon this holy seashore, I shall sit down to die.
'20': >-
  Hearing these words spoken by the prince, the youthful regent, all those
  foremost of monkeys replied with speech full of compassion.
'21': >-
  “Sugrīva is harsh by nature, and Rāghava is devoted to what is dear (to him).
  When they see that the task has not been accomplished and that the appointed
  time has passed,
'22': >-
  and that the princess of Videha has not been found—though we have
  returned—then, for the sake of what is dear to Rāghava, he will surely put us
  to death without doubt.
'23': >-
  And it is not fitting for those who have offended to go into the presence of
  their master. Moreover, we are the foremost ones among Sugrīva’s (followers),
  and we have returned.
'24': >-
  Let us search for Sītā right here and either obtain some news (of her) or
  else—if not—let us not go to that hero; we shall go to Yama’s imperishable
  abode (that is, to death).”
'25': >-
  Hearing the words of the terrified monkeys, Tārā spoke this: “Enough of
  despair. Enter this cave and dwell (here), all of us, if that pleases you.”
'26': >-
  “For this indeed is a stronghold most difficult to assail, fashioned by
  enchantment—abounding in flowers, water, food, and drink. Here there is no
  fear for us—neither from Indra the destroyer, nor from Rāghava, nor even from
  the king of monkeys.”
'27': >-
  Hearing even Aṅgada’s words, favorable (to this course), all the
  monkeys—convinced—said: “Let a plan be made for us this very day, without
  attachment, so that we may not be slain.”
'28': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-third chapter of the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa in the revered,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Despondency
  of Aṅgada and the Others.”
