  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  thirty-seventh sarga, called “Pauro-pasthānam” (The Attending of the
  Citizens).
'1': >-
  When Kakutstha (Rāma) had been consecrated according to dharma, being a knower
  of his own true self, that night which had passed before—one that increased
  the joy of the citizens—came to its end.
'2': >-
  When that night had dawned, in the morning the bards whose duty it was to
  awaken the king—gentle in speech—presented themselves at the royal residence.
'3': >-
  All of them, with melodious and trained voices, like well-taught Kiṃnaras,
  praised the heroic king in due form, filled with delight.
'4': >-
  “O hero, O gentle one, awake—O increaser of Kauśalyā’s joy! For indeed the
  whole world sleeps when you, O lord of men, are asleep.
'5': >-
  Your prowess is like that of Viṣṇu; your beauty is like that of the Aśvins; in
  intelligence you are equal to Bṛhaspati; and you are comparable to Prajāpati.
'6': >-
  Your forbearance is like the earth; in radiance you are like the sun; your
  speed is equal to the wind; and your depth is like that of the ocean.
'7': >-
  Unshakable like a firm and immovable pillar, and endowed with such gentleness
  as the moon—kings like you, O lord of men, have not been before, nor will they
  be.
'8': >-
  As you are exceedingly difficult to assail, ever steadfast in dharma, and
  devoted to the welfare of your subjects, neither fame nor fortune ever
  forsakes you, O best of men.
'9': >-
  Prosperity and dharma, O Kakutstha, are ever established in you; these and
  other sweet praises were proclaimed by the bards.
'10': >-
  And the sūtas, with divine eulogies, awakened Rāghava; praised with such
  laudations, Rāghava awoke.
'11': >-
  Leaving that couch, spread with pale and spotless coverings, he arose—like
  Hari Nārāyaṇa rising from his serpent-bed.
'12': >-
  When that great-souled one had arisen, men—bowing low with joined
  palms—attended upon him in thousands, bringing water in shining, auspicious
  vessels.
'13': >-
  Having performed the morning ablutions and become purified with water, and
  having offered oblations into the sacred fire at the proper time, he swiftly
  went to the holy temple of the gods, frequented by the Ikṣvāku line.
'14': >-
  There, having worshipped the gods, the pitṛs (manes), and the brāhmaṇas
  according to rule, Rāma—surrounded by people—came out into the outer court.
'15': >-
  Then the great-souled ministers, along with the family priest, attended upon
  him—Vasiṣṭha and the others—shining like fires.
'16': >-
  And great-souled kṣatriyas, lords of many kingdoms, sat by Rāma’s side—like
  the immortals beside Śakra.
'17': >-
  There too were Bharata and Lakṣmaṇa, and Śatrughna of great renown; rejoicing,
  they attended upon him like the three Vedas attending a sacrifice.
'18': >-
  Servants, with hands folded in reverence and faces bright with gladness,
  approached and sat near at hand—many of them—joyful in countenance.
'19': >-
  And twenty mighty monkey-heroes, able to assume forms at will—of great energy,
  with Sugrīva at their head—attended upon Rāma.
'20': >-
  Vibhīṣaṇa too, surrounded by four rākṣasas, attended upon that great-souled
  one—like the guhyakas attending Kubera, lord of wealth.
'21': >-
  So also the elders learned in the nigamas, and men of good family—wise and
  discerning—bowing their heads in homage, attended upon the king.
'22': >-
  Thus was the king surrounded—attended by illustrious ṛṣis, by kings of great
  prowess, by vānaras, and by rākṣasas as well.
'23': >-
  As the lord of the gods is ever attended by ṛṣis, so was he; and in splendour
  of form he shone more brilliantly than the thousand-eyed (Indra).
'24': >-
  When all those had taken their seats, many exceedingly sweet conversations
  were spoken—endowed with dharma—by great-souled men who were versed in the
  Purāṇas.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-seventh sarga, called “Pauro-pasthānam” (The Attending of
  the Citizens), in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  Ādi-kāvya.
