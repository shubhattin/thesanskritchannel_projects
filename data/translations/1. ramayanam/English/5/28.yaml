  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-eighth chapter, called “The Resolve to Hang Herself.”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of the lord of rākṣasas—those words of Rāvaṇa—Sītā,
  afflicted because what was pleasing to him was hateful to her, was struck with
  terror, like the daughter of a king of elephants in a forest when assailed by
  a lion.
'2': >-
  That timid Sītā, fallen amid the rākṣasīs and fiercely threatened by Rāvaṇa
  with harsh speech, lamented like a young maiden cast away in a lonely
  wilderness, in the midst of a great and trackless forest.
'3': >-
  Indeed, what the good say in this world is true: “There is no untimely death.”
  For I, though blameless, live even for a moment while thus being
  reviled—wretched that I am.
'4': >-
  Surely this heart of mine is firm—bereft of happiness and filled with many
  sorrows—for it does not split into a thousand pieces today, like the horn of a
  mountain shattered by a thunderbolt.
'5': >-
  Surely there is no fault of mine in this; I am to be slain by this man of
  hateful aspect. I cannot yield to his desire—no more than a twice-born gives a
  sacred mantra to one who is not twice-born.
'6': >-
  While that Lord of the world has not come—like the cutter of an embedded arrow
  for a creature in the womb—surely the ignoble lord of rākṣasas will before
  long cut my limbs with keen-edged weapons.
'7': >-
  Ah, this is sorrow indeed for one already afflicted: two months will pass,
  long and slowly, before they arrive—like the two remaining watches of night
  for a bound thief under royal custody, destined to be slain at daybreak.
'8': >-
  Alas, Rāma! Alas, Lakṣmaṇa! Alas, Sumitrā! Alas, mother of Rāma, together with
  my own mother! I, of scant good fortune, am perishing—like a boat on the great
  ocean driven astray by misguided winds.
'9': >-
  Those two mighty ones, the sons of the lord among men, who bore the form of a
  deer by the power of their being—surely, because of me, they were struck down,
  like two lion-bulls smitten by a flash of lightning.
'10': >-
  Surely it was Death himself, wearing the form of a deer, who enticed me,
  ill-fated as I am, at that time—when I, in folly, sent away the noble princes:
  Rāma’s younger brother Lakṣmaṇa, and his elder brother Rāma as well.
'11': >-
  Alas, Rāma—true to your vows, long-armed! Alas, whose face is like the full
  moon! Alas, beloved and beneficent to all living beings! Do you not know that
  I am to be slain by the rākṣasas?
'12': >-
  My having no other deity but you, my forbearance, my lying upon the bare
  earth, my restraints in the path of dharma, my very fidelity to my husband—all
  this has become fruitless, as though done for ungrateful men.
'13': >-
  In vain has been this dharma practiced by me, and meaningless too this
  single-spouse devotion—for I do not behold you. Emaciated and pale, bereft of
  union with you, and hopeless of meeting you, I waste away.
'14': >-
  Having fulfilled your father’s command with strict discipline, and having
  returned from the forest after observing your vow, I think you will be
  comforted by wide-eyed women—secure from fear and considering yourself
  successful.
'15': >-
  But I, Rāma—having set my desire upon you, and long bound by love only for my
  own ruin—after practicing austerity and vow to no purpose, will abandon my
  life. Fie upon my life, I of scant good fortune!
'16': >-
  Quickly would I cast away this life—by poison, or by a sharp weapon. Yet there
  is no one to give me poison, nor is there any weapon in the house of the
  rākṣasa.
'17': >-
  Burned by grief, thinking in many ways, Sītā then took hold of the braid of
  her hair; and with the unbraiding of that braid, I shall swiftly hang myself
  and go to the abode of Yama.
'18': >-
  Then she stood there—soft-limbed in every part—grasping a branch of that tree,
  while she contemplated Rāma, and her own younger brother-in-law (Lakṣmaṇa),
  and her family, she of auspicious form.
'19': >-
  At that time, for her, many excellent omens appeared—bringing the assurance of
  freedom from sorrow—such as are supreme in the world, and as had been
  previously observed and declared by the accomplished ones.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-eighth chapter of Sundara-kāṇḍa in the revered,
  illustrious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the First Poet, entitled “The
  Resolve to Hang Herself.”
