  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  six-hundred-and-sixth canto, named “Sārathi-vijñeyam (What a charioteer must
  know).”
'1': >-
  But Rāvaṇa, deluded and exceedingly enraged, impelled by the might of Death
  (Kṛtānta), his eyes reddened with wrath, spoke to the charioteer:
'2': >-
  “(You have made me seem) as though devoid of valor and unable, bereft of manly
  prowess—like a coward, light and insignificant, lacking true courage, as
  though stripped of splendor.
'3': >-
  As though abandoned by my stratagems, as though cast out by my weapons! O
  evil-minded one, despising me, you act according to your own understanding!
'4': >-
  For what reason, slighting me and disregarding my wish, have you driven this
  chariot away in the very presence of the enemy?
'5': >-
  “Today, O ignoble one, you have destroyed what I had amassed over a long
  time—my fame, my valor, my radiance, and the confidence (men place in me).”
'6': >-
  While that enemy, renowned for prowess and delighting the world by his
  exploits, looked on—though I was eager for battle—you have made me appear a
  wretched coward!
'7': >-
  How is it, O perverse-minded one, that out of delusion you do not carry me
  (into combat) like this? This reasoning of mine is true: you have been bribed
  by the other side.
'8': >-
  For such conduct is never found in a well-wisher who seeks his friend’s good.
  This deed of yours is akin to the conduct of enemies—what you have undertaken
  here.
'9': >-
  Turn the chariot back quickly, before my foe gets away—if you are not (wholly)
  corrupted, if any merit of mine is still remembered by you.
'10': >-
  Thus harshly addressed by one without understanding, the charioteer—whose
  intent was welfare—spoke to Rāvaṇa words that were wholesome, conciliatory,
  and for his good:
'11': >-
  “I am not afraid; I am not bewildered; I have not been tampered with by the
  enemies. I am not careless, nor without affection; right conduct has not been
  forgotten by me.
'12': >-
  But I—desiring your welfare and guarding your renown, my heart overflowing
  with loyalty—have done what is beneficial, though it may be displeasing.
'13': >-
  In this matter, O great king, you should not, regarding me as though I were
  some petty ignoble person, devoted to what is dear and beneficial to you,
  judge me with fault.
'14': >-
  Listen; I shall tell you the reason for which this chariot was turned back in
  battle—like a river’s current checked by surging waters.
'15': >-
  I perceive your exhaustion from the great labor of war; for I do not accept
  that your valor has reached its utmost pitch (at this moment).
'16': >-
  Worn out from bearing the chariot, my chariot-horses are broken with
  fatigue—wretched and distressed by the heat, like cattle struck down by
  drought.
'17': >-
  And many portents arise for us; when each of those occurs, I observe them as
  inauspicious—turning to the left, not favoring the right (i.e., not moving in
  a propitious course).
'18': >-
  Place and time are to be known; the signs and gestures (of men and fate) are
  to be understood; dejection, exhilaration, and discouragement, and also the
  strength and weakness of the warrior in the chariot—(all these must be
  discerned).
'19': >-
  The level and low places of the ground, the even and uneven tracts; the proper
  time for battle; and the gaining of insight into the foe’s vulnerable
  opening—these too are to be understood.
'20': >-
  Advancing and withdrawing, halting, and retreating to a safer position— all
  this is to be known by one who stands on the chariot, by one skilled in the
  duties of the chariot and its team.
'21': >-
  Therefore, for the sake of your resting—and for the resting of these
  chariot-horses—avoiding fierce exertion and setting aside weariness, I have
  done what is fitting.
'22': >-
  Not by my own whim, O hero, has this chariot been driven away. Out of
  affection for my lord, O master, have I done this.
'23': >-
  Command me truly as it should be, O slayer of foes. That I shall do, O hero,
  with a mind freed from all sense of having failed you.
'24': >-
  Pleased by those words of his charioteer, Rāvaṇa—eager for battle—praised him
  in many ways and then said this:
'25': >-
  “Drive this chariot quickly, O charioteer, facing Rāghava. Rāvaṇa will not
  turn back until he has struck down the enemies in battle.”
'26': >-
  Having spoken thus, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, while seated on the chariot,
  gave him one auspicious and excellent hand-ornament. Hearing Rāvaṇa’s words,
  the charioteer turned (the chariot) back.
'27': >-
  Then, urged by Rāvaṇa’s command, that charioteer swiftly urged on the horses;
  and then that great chariot of the lord of rākṣasas, in a moment, came to
  stand at the forefront of battle before Rāma.
'28': >-
  Thus ends the six-hundred-and-sixth canto, named “Sārathi-vijñeyam (What a
  charioteer must know),” in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya (first epic).
