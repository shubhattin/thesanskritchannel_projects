  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa,
  begins the ninety-fifth canto, called “The Description of the Mandākinī.”
'1': >-
  Then the lord of Kosala, having come forth from the mountain, showed Maithilī
  the lovely river Mandākinī, whose waters were clear and auspicious.
'2': >-
  Rāma, lotus-eyed, spoke to that lady of noble hips, whose countenance was like
  the fair moon—Sītā, the daughter of the king of Videha.
'3': >-
  “Behold the river Mandākinī—charming, with variegated sandy banks, frequented
  by swans and cranes, and richly adorned with lotuses.”
'4': >-
  “See how she shines on every side, encompassed by many kinds of trees growing
  upon the banks—trees laden with blossoms and fruits—like a lotus-pond
  belonging to an emperor, resplendent all around.”
'5': >-
  “Even now these delightful fords and bathing-places—where the waters have been
  drunk by herds of deer—awaken joy within me.”
'6': >-
  “At the proper hours, O beloved, sages wearing matted locks and deer-skins,
  clad in bark garments as their outer dress, enter and bathe in the river
  Mandākinī.”
'7': >-
  “With arms uplifted, in observance of their vows, they worship the Sun. These,
  O large-eyed one, are exalted ascetics—munis of well-established, austere
  vows.”
'8': >-
  “This mountain seems as though dancing, with its summits shaken by the wind,
  while the trees all about the river shower down leaves and blossoms.”
'9': >-
  “Behold the river Mandākinī: in some places her waters gleam like jewels; in
  some places she is graced with sandy reaches; and in some places she is
  crowded with perfected beings (siddhas).”
'10': >-
  “See the heaps of blossoms, scattered far and wide, shaken loose by the wind;
  and see also other blossoms floating and drifting, moving midstream upon the
  waters.”
'11': >-
  “And, O auspicious one, the twice-born birds called cakravākas, whose speech
  is exceedingly sweet, alight upon them, making melodious and pleasing cries.”
'12': >-
  “The sight of Citrakūṭa and of the splendid Mandākinī seems to me even more
  delightful than dwelling in a city—and still more so because I behold it with
  you.”
'13': >-
  “Come, enter the stream with me—whose waters are ever stirred by accomplished
  ascetics, who have shaken off all impurity, and are endowed with austerity,
  self-restraint, and tranquility.”
'14': >-
  “Enter the river Mandākinī, O Sītā, as though she were a companion; and, O
  radiant lady, while you dip down, plunge the lotuses and the blue water-lilies
  beneath the water.”
'15': >-
  “Ever regard this mountain as you would Ayodhyā thronged with townsfolk, O
  lady; and regard this river as you would the Sarayū.”
'16': >-
  “And Lakṣmaṇa too, righteous-souled, stands ready at my command; and you also,
  O princess of Videha, being favourable and gracious, bring gladness to my
  heart.”
'17': >-
  “Performing the prescribed ablutions at the three daily junctures, and living
  on honey, roots, and fruits, I do not today, with you beside me, long for
  Ayodhyā or for kingship.”
'18': >-
  “For this delightful river, filled with herds of deer, her waters drunk by
  elephants, lions, and monkeys, and adorned by blossoming trees bearing
  flowers—there is no one who, coming here, would not be happy and free from
  weariness.”
'19': >-
  Speaking thus—uttering many fitting and affectionate words to the river while
  accompanied by his beloved—Rāma, increaser of the Raghu line, moved about that
  lovely Citrakūṭa, dark in splendour like collyrium to the eyes.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-fifth canto, called “The Description of the Mandākinī,”
  in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
