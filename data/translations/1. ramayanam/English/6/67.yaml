'0': >-
  Now begins the Sixty-Seventh Sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Slaying of Kumbhakarṇa.”
'1': >-
  Then those huge-bodied vānara warriors, hearing Aṅgada’s words, returned (to
  the fight) at once; and, fixing their minds in steadfast resolve, all of
  them—eager for battle—set their determination firm.
'2': >-
  Their valor was roused, their prowess set aflame; and by the words of mighty
  Aṅgada they were held fast to their stand (and steadied in purpose).
'3': >-
  They marched forth and attained great exhilaration, having resolved upon
  death; and the vānara hosts, casting away thought of life, made that battle
  exceedingly tumultuous.
'4': >-
  Then the vast-bodied vānara warriors, swiftly uprooting great trees with their
  slopes (and roots) and also exceedingly large ones, rushed upon Kumbhakarṇa.
'5': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa, exceedingly enraged, lifting up his mace, that mighty,
  huge-bodied one harassed the foes and flung them away on every side.
'6': >-
  Seven and eight hundreds, and thousands of vānara warriors lay scattered upon
  the ground, struck down by Kumbhakarṇa.
'7': >-
  Seizing sixteen, and eighteen, and ten, and twenty, and thirty (at a time)
  with his arms, he ran about devouring them—violently enraged—like Garuḍa
  devouring serpents.
'8': >-
  Recovering their breath with difficulty, gathering together from place to
  place, the monkeys with trees and rocks in their hands took their stand at the
  forefront of battle.
'9': >-
  Then Dvivida, bull among the vānara hosts, uprooted a mountain and rushed
  (forward), like a rain-cloud moving slowly, resembling a mountain-peak.
'10': >-
  Uprooting it, that vānara hurled it at Kumbhakarṇa; but missing that
  huge-bodied one, it fell instead upon his army.
'11': >-
  It crushed horses and elephants, chariots and the best of elephants as well,
  and other rākṣasas too—such was the mountain’s crest.
'12': >-
  Struck by the force of that mountain, with horses and charioteers slain, the
  great battlefield became drenched with the blood of the rākṣasas.
'13': >-
  The vānara lords who fought from chariots, with arrows like Yama at the end of
  time, suddenly carried off the heads of roaring rākṣasas, with fearsome
  thunder-like sound.
'14': >-
  And the great-souled vānara warriors, uprooting huge trees, destroyed the
  rākṣasas everywhere in battle—along with chariots, horses, elephants, and
  camels.
'15': >-
  Hanūmān, stationed in the sky, showered upon Kumbhakarṇa’s head
  mountain-peaks, diverse boulders, and trees.
'16': >-
  Those mountain-peaks he split with his spear; and mighty Kumbhakarṇa also
  shattered that rain of trees.
'17': >-
  Then, grasping a sharp spear, he rushed upon the fierce vānara host; but
  Hanūmān, seizing a mountain summit, stood facing him as he charged.
'18': >-
  Enraged, he struck Kumbhakarṇa—of terrible, mountain-like body—with that best
  of mountains hurled with speed; and Kumbhakarṇa, overwhelmed by it, reeled—his
  limbs greasy with fat and smeared with blood.
'19': >-
  Whirling his spear that shone like lightning, like a flaming mountain-peak, he
  struck Māruti between the arms with dreadful force, as Guha once struck the
  mountain Kraunca.
'20': >-
  With his great arms pierced by the spear, staggering and vomiting blood from
  his mouth, Hanūmān roared terribly in that great battle—like the rumbling of
  clouds at the end of an age.
'21': >-
  Then the rākṣasa hosts, seeing him wounded, suddenly shouted in delight; but
  the monkeys, distressed and seized by fear, fled from Kumbhakarṇa in the
  fight.
'22': >-
  Then mighty Nīla, rallying the troops, hurled a mountain-crest at the wise
  Kumbhakarṇa.
'23': >-
  Seeing it falling, Kumbhakarṇa struck it with his fist; shattered by that
  blow, the mountain-crest broke apart and fell to the earth, with sparks and
  flame.
'24': >-
  Ṛṣabha, Śarabha, Nīla, Gavākṣa, and Gandhamādana—five tiger-like vānara
  champions—rushed upon Kumbhakarṇa.
'25': >-
  With rocks, trees, palms (and their trunks), their feet, and their fists—those
  great mighty ones struck the huge-bodied Kumbhakarṇa from all sides in battle.
'26': >-
  Feeling those blows as though they were mere touches, he did not waver; but he
  embraced Ṛṣabha, who came with great speed, with both his arms.
'27': >-
  Crushed in Kumbhakarṇa’s arms, the bull among vānara warriors—terrible
  Ṛṣabha—fell down, blood flowing from the front of his body.
'28': >-
  With his fist he killed Śarabha; with his knee he struck Nīla in battle; then
  Indra’s foe smote Gavākṣa with the palm of his hand, and in wrath with swift
  force he struck Gandhamādana with his foot.
'29': >-
  Afflicted by the blows dealt to them, drenched in blood, they swooned and fell
  upon the earth like kimsuka trees cut down.
'30': >-
  When those foremost vānara great-souled ones had been cast down, thousands of
  monkeys rushed upon Kumbhakarṇa.
'31': >-
  Like mountains attacking a mountain, all those bull-like monkeys climbed upon
  him, leapt, and bit him—those great mighty ones.
'32': >-
  With nails and teeth, with fists and arms as well, the bull-like monkeys
  struck the mighty-armed Kumbhakarṇa.
'33': >-
  Covered by thousands of monkeys, that rākṣasa tiger, like a mountain,
  shone—like a hill clothed with its own trees.
'34': >-
  With both arms that great mighty one seized all the monkeys and, in wrath,
  devoured them like Garuḍa devouring serpents.
'35': >-
  Cast into his mouth, which resembled the netherworld, some monkeys came out
  through his nostrils, and others through his ears.
'36': >-
  Devouring the monkeys in furious wrath, that rākṣasa chief, mountain-like,
  crushed all the monkeys in his rage.
'37': >-
  Making the earth wet with flesh and blood, that rākṣasa moved among the monkey
  armies like the fire of Time, blazing at dissolution.
'38': >-
  As Śakra with the thunderbolt in hand, as Antaka with the noose in hand, so
  did mighty Kumbhakarṇa appear in battle with spear in hand.
'39': >-
  As fire burns up dry forests in summer, so did Kumbhakarṇa consume the monkey
  armies.
'40': >-
  Then, being slain and their troops destroyed, the
  monkeys—terror-stricken—cried out in battle with distorted voices.
'41': >-
  Slain in many ways by Kumbhakarṇa, the monkeys—afflicted and broken in
  spirit—went to Rāghava for refuge.
'42': >-
  Seeing the monkeys routed, Vālī’s son, the grandson of the thunderbolt-handed
  (Indra), rushed with speed toward Kumbhakarṇa in that great battle.
'43': >-
  Grasping a huge mountain-peak and roaring again and again, he terrified all
  the rākṣasas who followed in Kumbhakarṇa’s footsteps.
'44': >-
  He hurled that mountain summit upon Kumbhakarṇa’s head; and Indra’s foe was
  struck on the head by that rock.
'45': >-
  Then Kumbhakarṇa blazed with mighty wrath, and, unable to endure it, rushed
  with speed at Vālī’s son.
'46': >-
  With a great roar terrifying all the monkeys, mighty Kumbhakarṇa, in rage,
  hurled his spear at Aṅgada.
'47': >-
  Seeing it coming, that strong vānara bull, well-skilled in the ways of war, by
  agility released (avoided) it.
'48': >-
  Leaping up swiftly, he struck him on the chest with his palm; struck thereby,
  Kumbhakarṇa, mountain-like, swooned from anger.
'49': >-
  Regaining consciousness, the exceedingly strong rākṣasa clenched his fist and
  flung Aṅgada away with a backhand; Aṅgada fell senseless.
'50': >-
  When that tiger-like monkey lay senseless upon the ground, Kumbhakarṇa seized
  that spear and rushed at Sugrīva.
'51': >-
  Seeing mighty Kumbhakarṇa charging, Sugrīva the hero, lord of the monkeys,
  sprang up.
'52': >-
  Lifting a mountain summit and swinging it, that great monkey rushed with speed
  at mighty Kumbhakarṇa.
'53': >-
  Seeing the monkey charge, Kumbhakarṇa stood with all his limbs turned, facing
  the monkey king.
'54': >-
  Seeing Kumbhakarṇa standing—his limbs smeared with monkey blood and devouring
  great monkeys—Sugrīva spoke these words.
'55': >-
  “Heroes have been cast down by you; a most difficult deed has been done; and
  armies have been devoured—supreme glory has come to you.”
'56': >-
  “Leave aside this monkey host—what will you do with common warriors? Endure a
  single blow from this mountain of mine, O rākṣasa!”
'57': >-
  Hearing the vānara king’s words, possessed of courage and steadfastness,
  Kumbhakarṇa, tiger among rākṣasas, replied.
'58': >-
  “You are the grandson of Prajāpati, and likewise the son of Ṛkṣarajas; endowed
  with fortitude and manliness—therefore you roar, O monkey.”
'59': >-
  Hearing Kumbhakarṇa’s speech, he whirled the mountain and at once released it;
  with that mountain, like a thunderbolt, he struck Kumbhakarṇa on the chest.
'60': >-
  That mountain-peak, suddenly shattered upon his broad arm, caused the monkeys
  to sink in despair at once, while the rākṣasa hosts shouted in joy.
'61': >-
  Struck by the mountain summit, he grew enraged; opening his mouth, he roared
  in wrath, and whirling his spear—bright as lightning—he hurled it to slay the
  lord of monkeys and bears.
'62': >-
  That sharp spear, driven forth by Kumbhakarṇa’s arm, having a golden shaft,
  Hanūmān swiftly sprang up, caught it with both arms, and broke it with force.
'63': >-
  That great iron spear, made as heavy as a thousand bhāras, Hanūmān broke by
  setting it upon his knee, rejoicing.
'64': >-
  Seeing the spear broken by Hanūmān, the vānara host rejoiced and roared
  repeatedly, and ran about on every side.
'65': >-
  Then the rākṣasa became terrified and turned away; the forest-dwellers,
  delighted, raised lion-roars and honored Māruti, seeing the spear thus dealt
  with.
'66': >-
  Seeing his spear broken, the great-souled lord of rākṣasas grew enraged;
  uprooting a peak from Mount Malaya by Laṅkā, he went up and struck Sugrīva
  with it.
'67': >-
  Struck by the mountain peak, the vānara king fell senseless upon the
  battlefield; seeing him lying unconscious on the ground, the yātudhānas
  shouted in delight.
'68': >-
  Approaching the wondrously dreadful hero in battle, Kumbhakarṇa seized Sugrīva
  and carried him off, like a fierce wind carrying away a cloud.
'69': >-
  As Kumbhakarṇa went in battle bearing him—whose form resembled a great
  cloud—he shone like Meru, with its dreadful peaks uplifted.
'70': >-
  Then the heroic rākṣasa king went, carrying him, praised in battle, hearing
  the cries of the dwellers of heaven—astonished at the capture of the monkey
  king.
'71': >-
  Carrying him, he deemed the monkey lord—Indra-like and of Indra’s
  prowess—(thinking): “If he is slain, then all this army with Rāghava will be
  slain,” so thought Indra’s enemy.
'72': >-
  Seeing the monkey army fleeing here and there, and Sugrīva seized by
  Kumbhakarṇa,
'73': >-
  Hanūmān, the wise son of the Wind-god, reflected: “Sugrīva has been
  seized—what ought I to do now?”
'74': >-
  “What is righteous for me to do, that I shall do without doubt. Becoming
  mountain-like, I shall destroy the rākṣasa.”
'75': >-
  “When in battle mighty Kumbhakarṇa is slain by me, his body shattered by
  fists, and the monkey king is set free, let all the monkeys rejoice together.”
'76': >-
  “Or else, this monkey may himself attain release; if he has been seized, even
  by the gods together with asuras and nāgas (he would not easily be freed).”
'77': >-
  “I think the monkey lord is not yet aware of himself, struck in battle by
  Kumbhakarṇa’s mountain blow.”
'78': >-
  “In a short while Sugrīva will regain consciousness in the great fight, and he
  will do what is wholesome for himself and for the monkeys.”
'79': >-
  “But if I were to free this great-souled Sugrīva, a grievous displeasure would
  arise, and a lasting loss of fame (for him) as well.”
'80': >-
  “Therefore I shall wait a moment to see the valor of the one who has been
  freed; meanwhile I shall encourage the broken monkey host.”
'81': >-
  Thinking thus, Hanūmān, the son of the Wind-god, once more steadied and
  rallied the great monkey army.
'82': >-
  Then Kumbhakarṇa entered Laṅkā carrying that mighty monkey, while the dwellers
  in aerial mansions, houses, and gate-towers honored him by showering excellent
  flowers.
'83': >-
  Sprinkled with showers of parched grain and fragrant powders, slowly, from the
  coolness of the royal road, that mighty one regained consciousness.
'84': >-
  Then, regaining consciousness with difficulty while held between the arms of
  that stronger one, the great-souled Sugrīva, looking upon the king’s highway,
  pondered again and again.
'85': >-
  “Thus seized, how indeed can I retaliate now? I shall act in such a way that
  it will be desired and beneficial for the monkeys.”
'86': >-
  Then, coming close suddenly, the king of monkeys—enemy of the foe of the lord
  of gods—bit with his nails his ears, with his teeth his nose, and tore his
  sides with his feet.
'87': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa, with ears and nose torn away and his body ripped by those teeth
  and nails, overcome by rage and his limbs wet with blood, whirled Sugrīva and
  dashed him upon the ground.
'88': >-
  Crushed on the earth by that terrible might, and being struck by those enemies
  of the gods, Sugrīva sprang into the sky with the speed of a ball, and again
  came to Rāma.
'89': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa, bereft of ears and nose, that mighty one, shone drenched in blood
  like a mountain with cascades.
'90': >-
  That huge-bodied rākṣasa of dreadful appearance, soaked with blood, again set
  his mind upon battle, facing toward the fight.
'91': >-
  From wrath, spewing blood, Rāvaṇa’s younger brother shone—like a rain-cloud,
  dark as heaps of blue collyrium, touched by twilight.
'92': >-
  When he had gone, that enemy of the king of gods, in anger, rushed again for
  battle; thinking “I am weaponless,” the fierce one then took up a dreadful
  iron club.
'93': >-
  Then that mighty one, suddenly issuing forth from the city into the fierce
  monkey army, Kumbhakarṇa devoured them in battle like the end-of-age fire
  grown vast devouring creatures.
'94': >-
  Hungry, craving blood and flesh, entering that fierce monkey army, in delusion
  Kumbhakarṇa ate monkeys, rākṣasas, piśācas, men and bears in battle; as Death
  at the end of an age carries away all, so did he devour even the foremost
  monkeys.
'95': >-
  Enraged, seizing one, two, three, or many monkeys together with rākṣasas, with
  a single hand he swiftly cast them into his mouth.
'96': >-
  While fat and blood flowed forth, that mighty one—though being struck by
  mountain peaks—continued to devour the monkeys.
'97': >-
  As they were being eaten, the monkeys then went to Rāma as their refuge;
  Kumbhakarṇa, exceedingly enraged, ran about devouring the monkeys.
'98': >-
  Seizing seven, and eight, and twenty, and thirty (at a time), embracing them
  with his arms, he devoured them and ran to and fro.
'99': >-
  His limbs smeared with fat, marrow, and blood, with garlands of intestines
  clinging to his ears, sharp-fanged, he rained down spears like Time at the end
  of the age, swollen in might.
'100': >-
  At that time Lakṣmaṇa, son of Sumitrā, destroyer of enemy strength, conqueror
  of hostile cities, in wrath began the battle.
'101': >-
  The valorous Lakṣmaṇa drove seven arrows into Kumbhakarṇa’s body, took up
  others, and discharged them.
'102': >-
  Pressed by that mighty weapon, the rākṣasa felt its special power; then that
  strong one—Sumitrā’s joy—increased in wrath.
'103': >-
  Then, with his arrows, he covered Kumbhakarṇa’s bright, auspicious armor made
  of Jāmbūnada gold, as the wind covers the twilight-clouds.
'104': >-
  Dark as heaps of blue collyrium, being pressed by arrows adorned with gold, he
  shone like the sun amid clouds.
'105': >-
  Then that dreadful rākṣasa addressed Sumitrā’s joy with disdain, his voice
  like the roar of massed clouds.
'106': >-
  “By fighting me fearlessly, you have made known your heroism in battle—(as
  though) you could conquer even Antaka with ease.”
'107': >-
  “Even when standing weapon-in-hand in this great combat like Death himself,
  one is worthy of honor—how much more one who grants battle!”
'108': >-
  “Mounted upon Airāvata and surrounded by all the immortals, even Śakra, the
  lord, has never stood thus in battle at any time.”
'109': >-
  “Today, O Saumitri, even by the valor of a mere boy like you, I am pleased; I
  wish to go—having asked leave of Rāghava.”
'110': >-
  “But since by your valor, strength, and ardor I am satisfied in battle, I
  desire to slay Rāma alone—when he is slain, all is slain.”
'111': >-
  “When I have slain Rāma here, those others who remain in the fight—I shall
  combat them by my own crushing might.”
'112': >-
  Thus spoke the rākṣasa in praise-laden words; then Saumitri, as though
  smiling, replied in battle with yet more dreadful speech.
'113': >-
  “That you, having attained manliness, are unbearable even to the gods
  beginning with Śakra—this is true and not otherwise, O hero; today your
  prowess is indeed seen.”
'114': >-
  “This Daśarathi Rāma stands like an unmoving mountain.” Hearing this, and
  disregarding Lakṣmaṇa, that night-ranger,
'115': >-
  Passing beyond Saumitri, mighty Kumbhakarṇa rushed straight toward Rāma, as
  though shaking the earth.
'116': >-
  Then Daśarathi Rāma, employing a dreadful weapon, released sharp arrows into
  Kumbhakarṇa’s heart.
'117': >-
  As he, pierced by Rāma, rushed forth suddenly, sparks mixed with embers issued
  from the mouth of that enraged one.
'118': >-
  Pierced by Rāma’s weapon, roaring terribly, the foremost of rākṣasas charged
  in fury, driving away the monkeys in battle.
'119': >-
  Those arrows, feathered like peacock plumes, sank into his chest; and from his
  hand his mace slipped and fell upon the ground.
'120': >-
  And all his weapons were scattered over the battlefield; when that mighty one
  considered himself weaponless,
'121': >-
  With fists and hands he wrought great slaughter. Though his body was
  grievously pierced by arrows and bathed in blood, blood streamed all around
  him like a mountain’s waterfalls.
'122': >-
  Then, with fierce wrath and maddened by blood, he ran about devouring monkeys,
  rākṣasas, and bears.
'123': >-
  Then, grasping a dreadful peak, that mighty one of terrible prowess, like
  Antaka, hurled it aiming at Rāma.
'124': >-
  Before it could reach him, Rāma, with seven straight-flying arrows, cut that
  mountain peak to pieces, having again strung his bow.
'125': >-
  Then righteous Rāma, the elder brother of Bharata, cut that great peak with
  arrows ornamented with golden designs.
'126': >-
  That peak, like the summit of Meru and shining with splendor, as it fell
  struck down two hundred monkeys.
'127': >-
  At that time righteous Lakṣmaṇa spoke to Rāma, considering many stratagems fit
  for the slaying of Kumbhakarṇa.
'128': >-
  “This one does not recognize monkeys, O king, nor rākṣasas; intoxicated by the
  smell of blood, he devours his own and others alike.”
'129': >-
  “Let the bull-like monkeys mount him from every side, and let the chief
  troop-leaders stand all around upon him.”
'130': >-
  “Today this ill-minded rākṣasa, pressed down by a heavy burden at this time,
  moving on the ground, will not slay other monkeys.”
'131': >-
  Hearing the wise prince’s words, those mighty monkeys, rejoicing, climbed upon
  Kumbhakarṇa.
'132': >-
  But Kumbhakarṇa, enraged, being mounted by the monkeys, shook them off with
  force—like a vicious elephant shaking off elephant-keepers.
'133': >-
  Seeing them shaken off, Rāma thought, “This rākṣasa is enraged,” and sprang
  forward swiftly, taking up his excellent bow.
'134': >-
  With eyes reddened by wrath, steadfast, as though burning with his gaze,
  Rāghava rushed at the rākṣasa with speed—gladdening all the troop-leaders
  tormented by Kumbhakarṇa’s might.
'135': >-
  Taking up his serpent-like bow—firmly strung, fierce, adorned with burnished
  gold—and heartening the monkeys, Rāma sprang forward, his quiver bound with
  the best arrows.
'136': >-
  That hero, follower of Lakṣmaṇa, surrounded by those monkeys—most difficult to
  overcome—set forth, mighty in strength.
'137': >-
  He beheld that great-souled foe-destroyer, crowned, red-eyed from being bathed
  in blood—mighty Kumbhakarṇa.
'138': >-
  Rushing upon all like an enraged elephant of the quarters, searching for the
  monkeys in fury, surrounded by rākṣasas.
'139': >-
  Resembling Vindhya and Mandara, adorned with golden armlets and ornaments,
  blood streaming from his mouth like a risen rain-cloud.
'140': >-
  Licking with his tongue his blood-soaked lips, crushing the monkey host—like
  Yama, the bringer of death, at the end of time.
'141': >-
  Seeing that foremost of rākṣasas, blazing like kindled fire, the bull among
  men then drew his bow-string taut.
'142': >-
  At the sound of Rāma’s bow, the enraged bull among rākṣasas, unable to endure
  that noise, rushed upon Rāghava.
'143': >-
  Then Rāma spoke in battle to Kumbhakarṇa, who resembled a wind-driven cloud,
  whose arms were like the coils of the king of serpents, charging like a
  mountain.
'144': >-
  “Come, O lord of rākṣasas; do not despond. I stand ready with bow in hand.
  Know me to be the destroyer of the rākṣasa race—within a moment you will be
  bereft of consciousness.”
'145': >-
  Recognizing, “This is Rāma,” he laughed with a harsh sound and charged in
  fury, driving away the monkeys in battle.
'146': >-
  As though rending the hearts of all the forest-dwellers, he laughed fearfully,
  dreadful like the rumbling of thunderclouds.
'147': >-
  Mighty, radiant Kumbhakarṇa spoke to Rāghava: “I am not to be known as
  Virādha, nor Kabandha, nor Khara; not Vālī, nor Mārīca—Kumbhakarṇa has come.”
'148': >-
  “Behold my dreadful club, wholly of black iron and huge. With this I once
  conquered the gods and the dānavas.”
'149': >-
  “Because I am ‘the one with nose and ears cut,’ you should not despise me;
  indeed, even slight pain does not arise in me from the loss of nose and ears.”
'150': >-
  “O tiger among Ikṣvāku’s line, behold my strength in my limbs, O sinless one.
  Then I shall devour you, after your manly valor is seen.”
'151': >-
  Hearing Kumbhakarṇa’s words, Rāma released well-feathered arrows; struck by
  them, swift as thunderbolts, the enemy of the gods neither reeled nor felt
  distress.
'152': >-
  Those very arrows by which sāla trees were felled and Vālī, the foremost of
  monkeys, was slain—against Kumbhakarṇa’s body they did not then cause pain,
  though thunderbolt-like.
'153': >-
  As though drinking those arrows into his body like streams of rain, the foe of
  Mahendra struck down Rāma’s arrow-force, whirling his club of dreadful speed.
'154': >-
  Then that rākṣasa, smeared with blood, terrifying to the great hosts of the
  gods, whirled his club of fierce speed and drove the monkey army into flight.
'155': >-
  Then Rāma took up the Wind-weapon, and another weapon besides, and hurled it
  at the night-ranger; with it he severed the arm that held the club, and the
  arm-cut one roared tumultuously.
'156': >-
  That arm of his, like a mountain peak, together with the club, cut off by
  Rāghava’s arrows, fell into Sugrīva’s army and struck down that monkey host.
'157': >-
  Those monkeys—broken, slain, and the remnants left—retreated to the outskirts
  in despondency, their limbs afflicted, and beheld that most dreadful encounter
  between the king of men and the lord of rākṣasas.
'158': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa, his arm cut off by weapons, like a mountain whose top is cut by a
  great sword, tore up a tree with his hand and rushed upon the king of men in
  battle.
'159': >-
  Rāma struck that raised arm—bearing a palm tree, like a serpent’s coil—with a
  golden-decorated arrow charged with the weapon of Indra.
'160': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa’s severed arm fell to the earth like a mountain; writhing, it
  struck trees, rocks, boulders, monkeys, and rākṣasas.
'161': >-
  Seeing him with arm cut off, and charging, roaring suddenly, Rāma took two
  sharp half-moon arrows and cut off the rākṣasa’s two feet in battle.
'162': >-
  Those two feet, as they fell, resounded through the quarters and directions,
  the mountain caves and the great ocean, Laṅkā and the armies of monkeys and
  rākṣasas.
'163': >-
  With arm severed and feet cut off, tearing open his mouth like the mare-faced
  fire, he rushed at Rāma roaring—like Rāhu in the sky rushing upon the moon.
'164': >-
  Rāma filled his mouth with sharp-pointed arrows having gold-bound fletching;
  with his mouth stuffed full he could not speak—he croaked with difficulty and
  even swooned.
'165': >-
  Then Rāma took up the Indra-arrow, unerring, sharp, well-feathered—like the
  rays of the sun, like Brahmā’s staff, like Antaka and Kāla—of wind-like speed.
'166': >-
  That arrow, with beautiful golden fletching like a thunderbolt, radiant like
  the blazing sun and fire, of the speed of Indra’s thunderbolt, Rāma hurled at
  the night-ranger.
'167': >-
  Driven by Rāghava’s arm, that arrow, illuminating the ten directions by its
  own radiance, dreadful like smokeless fire, went forth with the fearsome might
  of Indra’s thunderbolt.
'168': >-
  Then, like Indra of old cutting down Vṛtra, it severed the head of the lord of
  rākṣasas—mountain-peak-like, with well-rounded fangs and moving splendid
  earrings.
'169': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa’s great head, adorned with earrings, shone—like the moon standing
  in mid-heaven on a night when the sun has risen (in strange portent).
'170': >-
  That rākṣasa head, struck by Rāma’s arrow, fell—mountain-like—and shattered
  aerial mansions and gate-towers, and even brought down the lofty ramparts.
'171': >-
  And that gigantic body, radiant like Himavat, then fell into the ocean; it
  crushed huge sea-creatures, great fishes, and serpents, and sank into the
  depths, and also struck the earth.
'172': >-
  When that mighty Kumbhakarṇa—enemy of brāhmaṇas and the gods—was slain in
  battle, the earth and all the mountains shook; and the gods roared loudly with
  joy.
'173': >-
  Then devarṣis, great ṛṣis, nāgas, gods, bhūtas, suparṇas, and
  guhyakas—together with hosts of yakṣas and gandharvas—rejoiced in the sky at
  Rāma’s prowess.
'174': >-
  But those strong-willed kinsmen of the king of rākṣasas, greatly afflicted by
  his abundant slaughter, cried aloud in anguish, seeing Raghu’s best—like
  maddened elephants.
'175': >-
  As the sun, freed from the mouth of Rāhu after slaying the darkness of the
  gods’ world, so did Rāma shine amid the monkey host, having slain Kumbhakarṇa
  in battle.
'176': >-
  Many monkeys were filled with joy, their faces like blossomed lotuses; and
  they honored Rāghava, worthy of the best offerings, since the fearful, mighty
  foe—the prince—had been slain.
'177': >-
  Having slain Kumbhakarṇa—crusher of the gods’ armies, never before conquered
  in great battles—Bharata’s elder brother rejoiced in war, like the lord of
  gods after slaying the great asura Vṛtra.
'178': >-
  Thus ends the Sixty-Seventh Sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Slaying of Kumbhakarṇa.”
