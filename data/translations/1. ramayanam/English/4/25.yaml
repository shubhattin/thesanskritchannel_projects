'0': >-
  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa,
  begins the twenty-fifth canto, entitled “The Funeral Rites of Vāli.”
'1': >-
  Rāma, the scion of Kakutstha, sharing the same grief, consoled Sugrīva, Tārā,
  and Aṅgada—(and also Lakṣmaṇa being with him)—and spoke these words:
'2': >-
  The dead are not benefited by sorrow and anguish. Therefore, you ought to
  attend to what is to be done here immediately thereafter.
'3': >-
  The conduct of the world must be observed; you have done the shedding of tears
  as is proper. Beyond the appointed time, no further duty can be effectively
  performed.
'4': >-
  Destiny (niyati) is the cause in the world; destiny is the accomplisher of
  action. Destiny is indeed the cause in the ordinances that befall all
  creatures here.
'5': >-
  No one is the maker of another’s destiny, nor is any one the sovereign over
  it. The world moves according to its own nature; and Time is its ultimate
  resort.
'6': >-
  Time does not overtake Time, nor is Time diminished; and, having reached one’s
  own nature, no one is able to go beyond it.
'7': >-
  With Time there is no kinship, no motive, no prowess; neither friendship nor
  relation of kinsmen is a cause, nor is it under one’s own control.
'8': >-
  Rather, the transformation wrought by Time should be beheld by one who sees
  rightly. Dharma, artha, and kāma are all established according to the sequence
  and order of Time.
'9': >-
  From here Vāli has gone to his own natural state and has attained the fruit of
  his deeds; the lord of monkeys has become purified through the union of
  conciliation and gifts and rightful purpose.
'10': >-
  And by adherence to his own dharma, that great-souled one has been conquered
  by it; and, not guarding his life-breath, he has also obtained heaven.
'11': >-
  This indeed is the supreme destiny which the leader of the monkey-host has
  reached. Therefore enough of tormenting grief—let the destined hour be honored
  and what is due at this time be performed.
'12': >-
  When Rāma had thus concluded his words, Lakṣmaṇa, slayer of hostile heroes,
  addressed Sugrīva—whose mind was overwhelmed—with a humble speech:
'13': >-
  Do you, Sugrīva, perform next the rite due to the departed. Together with Tārā
  and Aṅgada, proceed toward the cremation of Vāli.
'14': >-
  Command that much dry firewood be brought, and also divine sandalwood, for the
  sake of Vāli’s funeral rites.
'15': >-
  Do you comfort poor Aṅgada whose mind is downcast. Do not become childish in
  understanding; this city is dependent upon you.
'16': >-
  Let Aṅgada bring garlands, and garments of various kinds, clarified butter and
  oil, and fragrances, and whatever else is immediately required here.
'17': >-
  And you, Tārā, quickly bring the palanquin and come with urgency; speed joined
  with good qualities is especially needful at this time.
'18': >-
  Let the monkeys who are fit to bear the palanquin make themselves
  ready—capable and strong—so that they may carry Vāli out.
'19': >-
  Having thus spoken to Sugrīva, Lakṣmaṇa, increaser of Sumitrā’s joy and slayer
  of enemy-heroes, stood near his brother.
'20': >-
  Hearing Lakṣmaṇa’s words, Tārā, her mind agitated, quickly entered the cave,
  intent upon bringing the palanquin.
'21': >-
  Taking up the palanquin, Tārā returned again; it was being lifted by heroic
  monkeys fit to bear burdens.
'22': >-
  It was a splendid, auspicious palanquin furnished with an excellent seat,
  resembling a chariot—adorned with wing-like ornamentation and embellished with
  carvings of trees.
'23': >-
  It was inlaid with wondrous panels, well-arranged on every side, like the
  aerial car of the Siddhas, furnished with latticed windows.
'24': >-
  Well-fitted, broad, well-made, wrought by artisans—provided with mountain-like
  wooden projections and refined by beautiful workmanship.
'25': >-
  Beautified with excellent ornaments and necklaces, and adorned with variegated
  garlands; covered over by the thick shade of the cave’s depths and decorated
  with red sandalwood.
'26': >-
  Covered all over with heaps of flowers and with garlands of lotuses, and
  wrapped about with radiance gleaming like the hue of the rising sun.
'27': >-
  Seeing such a palanquin, Rāma said to Lakṣmaṇa: “Quickly let Vāli be placed
  upon it; let the rites due to the departed be performed.”
'28': >-
  Then Sugrīva lifted up Vāli and set him upon the palanquin, crying aloud,
  together with Aṅgada.
'29': >-
  Having placed upon the palanquin Vāli, bereft of life, they adorned him with
  various ornaments, garlands, and garments.
'30': >-
  Then King Sugrīva, lord of the monkeys, gave command: “Let the funerary rites
  of this noble one be performed in accordance with what is proper.”
'31': >-
  Bestowing many and various jewels, let the monkeys go in front, and let the
  palanquin follow thereafter.
'32': >-
  For such special marks of royal prosperity as are seen on earth—let the
  monkeys here perform their lord’s honored obsequies in that very manner.
'33': >-
  Thus they quickly carried out for Vāli such funerary rites; and then Tārā and
  the others promptly embraced Aṅgada.
'34': >-
  Crying aloud, all the monkeys—bereft of their kinsman—set forth; and after
  them went all the she-monkeys under his authority and obedient to him.
'35': >-
  They cried, “Hero! Hero!” and again they wailed for their beloved—Tārā and all
  the she-monkeys, their kinsman slain.
'36': >-
  Wailing with pitiable voices, they followed their lord; and by the sound of
  the weeping of those she-monkeys in the woodland,
'37': >-
  the forests and the mountains too seemed, on every side, to cry out—on the
  sandbank of the mountain-river, secluded and surrounded by water.
'38': >-
  Many monkeys who ranged the forest prepared a funeral pyre; then, having
  brought down the palanquin from their shoulders, the foremost of monkeys,
'39': >-
  stood apart, all wholly given over to grief. Then Tārā, seeing her husband
  lying upon the floor of the palanquin,
'40': >-
  placed his head upon her lap and lamented, afflicted with exceeding sorrow:
  “Alas, great king of monkeys! Alas, my lord, my beloved!”
'41': >-
  “Alas, most worthy one, mighty-armed! Alas, my dear—look upon me! Why do you
  not look upon this people, oppressed by grief?”
'42': >-
  “Your face is cheerful even though life has departed, O giver of honor; and it
  appears like the face of one living, of a hue like the sun.”
'43': >-
  “This is Time, assuming the form of Rāma, that drags you away, O monkey—by
  whom all of us were made widows in battle with a single arrow.”
'44': >-
  “These women of yours, O lord of kings—your she-monkeys, who do not move by
  leaping—have come a road dragged along by their feet; do you not perceive it?”
'45': >-
  “Surely these were dear to you—your wives with moon-like faces. Why do you not
  look now upon Sugrīva, O lord of monkeys?”
'46': >-
  “These are your ministers, O king, beginning with me, Tārā; and this people of
  the city too, gathering around, grieves.”
'47': >-
  “Dismiss these ministers back to the city, O subduer of foes; then shall we
  all sport in the forests, driven to frenzy by love.”
'48': >-
  Thus lamenting, Tārā, encompassed by sorrow for her husband—the she-monkeys,
  themselves worn down by grief, then raised her up.
'49': >-
  Then Aṅgada, weeping for his father, together with Sugrīva, placed him upon
  the pyre, his senses overwhelmed by sorrow.
'50': >-
  Then, having offered the fire according to rule, he performed the
  circumambulation with the left side (aprasavya), his senses distraught, as for
  a father who has set out upon the long road.
'51': >-
  Having duly performed the funeral rites for Vāli, the foremost of monkeys went
  to the water for the libations, to a river of auspicious and kindly waters.
'52': >-
  Then, gathered there, placing Aṅgada in front, and accompanied by Sugrīva and
  Tārā, they poured water for Vāli.
'53': >-
  And Rāma, the scion of Kakutstha, sharing the same grief, had the funerary
  rites performed—while even Sugrīva, though mighty, became dejected with
  dejection.
'54': >-
  Then that monkey (Sugrīva), having burned Vāli—the foremost in prowess—slain
  by the arrow of Rāma, prince of the Ikṣvāku line, and blazing then with energy
  like a kindled fire, approached Rāma together with Lakṣmaṇa.
'55': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fifth canto, entitled “The Funeral Rites of Vāli,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
