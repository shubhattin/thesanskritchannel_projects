  Now begins the thirty-first canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Employment of Māyā by Vidyujjihva.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter the spies of the lord of Laṅkā reported to the king about that
  irresistible and unshakable might of his, namely Rāghava, seated upon Mount
  Suvela.
'2': >-
  Hearing from the spies that mighty Rāma had arrived, Rāvaṇa was shaken with
  anxiety; and, becoming somewhat perturbed, he spoke thus to his counselors.
'3': >-
  “Let all the ministers come swiftly, well-composed and attentive. For this is
  the hour for counsel that has come upon us,” said the rākṣasa.
'4': >-
  Hearing his command, the ministers came quickly. Then he took counsel together
  with the rākṣasa advisers.
'5': >-
  And having deliberated thereafter on what was fitting and practicable, the
  unassailable one dismissed his ministers and entered his own palace.
'6': >-
  Then, taking with him the mighty rākṣasa Vidyujjihva—an illusionist of great
  māyā—he entered the place where Maithilī was.
'7': >-
  And the lord of the rākṣasas spoke to Vidyujjihva, skilled in illusion: “Let
  us bewilder Sītā, the daughter of Janaka, by māyā.”
'8': >-
  “Taking up a head made by illusion—Rāghava’s—O night-ranger, stand ready
  before me; and (produce) also his great bow together with its arrows.”
'9': >-
  Thus addressed, the night-ranger Vidyujjihva replied, “So be it,” and he
  displayed that illusion—well contrived—before Rāvaṇa.
'10': >-
  The king was pleased with him and bestowed ornaments. Then, longing for the
  sight of Sītā, he entered the Aśoka grove.
'11': >-
  The powerful lord of the rākṣasas went in; and then the younger brother of the
  Lord of Wealth beheld her, dejected though not deserving of dejection.
'12': >-
  With face cast down, sunk in grief, seated upon the ground—having come to the
  Aśoka grove—she was meditating upon her husband.
'13': >-
  Attended from a distance by fearsome rākṣasīs, he approached Sītā and,
  announcing himself as ‘Praharṣa,’ spoke these audacious words to the daughter
  of Janaka.
'14': >-
  “O auspicious lady, you, being consoled by me, grieve in reliance on him whom
  you have taken for refuge.”
'15': >-
  “That Rāghava—your husband, the slayer of Khara—has been slain in battle. Your
  very root has been utterly cut off, and your pride, too, has been struck down
  by me.”
'16': >-
  “In your misfortune, O Sītā, you shall become my wife. Abandon this notion, O
  foolish woman—what will you do with one who is dead?”
'17': >-
  “Be, O fair one, the sovereign lady over all my wives. O woman of scant merit,
  your purpose thwarted, deluded, thinking yourself wise—hear of your husband’s
  killing, O Sītā, dreadful like the slaying of Vṛtra.”
'18': >-
  “Rāghava, they say, came to the shore of the ocean to slay me, surrounded by a
  vast host led by the lord of monkeys.”
'19': >-
  “Rāma, with a great army, encamped by pressing upon the northern shore of the
  sea as the sun went to his setting.”
'20': >-
  “Then, on the way, the army—wearied—halted at midnight; and, finding them
  sleeping at ease, our spies first ranged among them.”
'21': >-
  “There, in the night, that army of his—where Rāma was with Lakṣmaṇa—was slain
  by my great force led by Prahasta.”
'22': >-
  “Lances and iron bars, discs, spears, clubs, great weapons; nets of arrows,
  tridents, shining heavy maces made for deceit—”
'23': >-
  “—staves, tomaras, javelins, discs, and mallets—raising them again and again,
  the rākṣasas hurled them down upon the monkeys.”
'24': >-
  “Then, while Rāma slept, Prahasta the destroyer—swift and sure-handed—cut off
  his head with a great sword, without resistance.”
'25': >-
  “Vibhīṣaṇa, springing up, was seized by chance; Lakṣmaṇa, together with the
  monkeys, was chased away by the troops in all directions.”
'26': >-
  “Sugrīva, lord of monkeys, had his neck broken, O Sītā; Hanūmān, his jaw
  shattered, was slain by the rākṣasas, O Sītā.”
'27': >-
  “And Jāmbavān, leaping up on his knees, was slain in battle—cut again and
  again by many lances, felled like a tree hewn down.”
'28': >-
  “And Mainda and Dvivida too—those two bull-like heroes among the monkeys—were
  gasping, crying, and drenched in blood.”
'29': >-
  “Both those destroyers of foes were cut in the middle by a sword, and lay
  heaving upon the earth—like a jackfruit tree split in two.”
'30': >-
  “Dārīmukha, cut by many iron arrows, lies in a cleft; but Kumuda, of great
  splendor, was slain by shafts even as he roared.”
'31': >-
  “Aṅgada too, struck and cut by many arrows by the rākṣasas, fell upon the
  ground, blood streaming forth on every side.”
'32': >-
  “Some monkeys were crushed by serpents, others by a multitude of chariots;
  they lay there pounded—like clouds scattered by the speed of the wind.”
'33': >-
  “Others, terrified, fled; being struck down from behind, they were pursued by
  the rākṣasas like lions (pursuing) great elephants.”
'34': >-
  “Some fell into the sea; some took refuge in the sky; the bears climbed upon
  trees, resorting to the manner of monkeys.”
'35': >-
  “And on the shores of the sea, on mountains, and in forests, many tawny
  monkeys were slain by rākṣasas with misshapen eyes.”
'36': >-
  “Thus has your husband, together with his army, been slain by my army. And
  this head of his, drenched with blood and soiled with dust, has been brought
  (here).”
'37': >-
  Then the exceedingly unassailable Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, while Sītā was
  listening, spoke these words to a rākṣasī.
'38': >-
  “Bring that rākṣasa of cruel deeds—Vidyujjihva—by whom that head of Rāghava
  was himself brought from the battlefield.”
'39': >-
  Vidyujjihva then, taking that head together with the bow and arrows, bowed his
  head in obeisance and stood before Rāvaṇa.
'40': >-
  Then King Rāvaṇa spoke to that rākṣasa who stood there—Vidyujjihva of the
  mighty tongue—who was close at hand.
'41': >-
  “Set before Sītā, quickly, Daśaratha’s son’s head. Let the wretched one
  clearly see her husband’s final condition.”
'42': >-
  Thus commanded, that rākṣasa placed that beloved-looking head before Sītā and
  immediately disappeared from sight.
'43': >-
  Rāvaṇa also cast down a great, shining bow, famed in the three worlds, saying,
  “This is Rāma’s.”
'44': >-
  “This is that bow of your Rāma, fitted with its bowstring. It was brought here
  by Prahasta, having slain that man in the night.”
'45': >-
  Then, strewing upon the ground both that head and the bow along with
  Vidyujjihva, he spoke to the illustrious daughter of the king of Videha: “Now
  be obedient to my will.”
'46': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-first canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, entitled “The Employment of Māyā by Vidyujjihva.”
