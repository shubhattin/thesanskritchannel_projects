  Now begins, in the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa—within the Uttara-kāṇḍa—the
  thirty-second canto, entitled “The Seizure of Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Not far from that region—on the bank of the river Narmadā—there, the
  exceedingly dreadful lord of the rākṣasas (Rāvaṇa) was performing an offering
  of flowers.
'2': >-
  There the mighty Arjuna—most excellent among the victorious, the sovereign
  lord of Māhiṣmatī—was sporting, in the company of women, having resorted to
  the waters of the Narmadā.
'3': >-
  Arjuna, the king, standing amid them, shone with splendor then—like an
  elephant stationed in the midst of a thousand female elephants.
'4': >-
  Desirous of ascertaining the supreme strength of his thousand arms, he,
  surrounded by many arms, checked and held back the rushing current of the
  Narmadā.
'5': >-
  That pure water, having come into contact with the arms of Kārtavīrya, and
  making as though it were presenting an offering to the bank, rushed back
  upstream, flowing in the opposite direction.
'6': >-
  Filled with crocodiles, aquatic monsters and makaras, and spread with flowers
  and kuśa grass, that rushing surge of the Narmadā’s waters appeared like the
  rainy season itself.
'7': >-
  That torrent of waters—impelled, as it were, by Kārtavīrya—carried away
  entirely the whole flower-offering that belonged to Rāvaṇa.
'8': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa, abandoning the observance that he had only half completed, beheld
  the lovely Narmadā turned against him—like a beloved woman suddenly become
  adverse.
'9': >-
  Seeing that surge of waters increasing, resembling the outpouring of the
  ocean, and advancing toward the eastern quarter from the west—
'10': >-
  —Rāvaṇa then beheld the river, where birds wheeled about in confusion, and
  which had, as it were, come to rest from its natural course—appearing like a
  woman with motionless limbs.
'11': >-
  With the forefinger of his left hand, and with an audible gesture and command,
  Daśānana ordered Śuka and Sāraṇa to investigate the cause and power of that
  rushing force.
'12': >-
  Those two brothers, Śuka and Sāraṇa, commanded by Rāvaṇa, heroic, moving
  through midair, set out facing west.
'13': >-
  Having gone only about half a yojana, those two night-rangers saw a man in the
  water, sporting together with a woman.
'14': >-
  He appeared like a great sāla tree; his hair was disheveled by the tossing
  waters; his eyes were reddened with intoxication; his radiance was disturbed
  by drunken exhilaration.
'15': >-
  They saw him—the subduer of foes—blocking the river with a thousand arms, as
  though he were restraining the earth itself with a thousand feet, like a
  mountain.
'16': >-
  He was surrounded by a thousand choice young women—like a mighty elephant
  encompassed by a thousand rut-maddened female elephants.
'17': >-
  Beholding that most marvelous sight, the two rākṣasas, Śuka and Sāraṇa, turned
  back; approaching Rāvaṇa, they spoke to him thus.
'18': >-
  “O lord of rākṣasas, some person—like a great sāla tree—has blocked the
  Narmadā as with a dam, and is making it a place of sport with women.”
'19': >-
  “By that thousand-armed one the river’s waters are held back; again and again
  it sends forth great gushes, like the outpouring of the ocean.”
'20': >-
  Hearing those words spoken by Śuka and Sāraṇa, Rāvaṇa said, “(It is) Arjuna,”
  and—eager for battle—set forth.
'21': >-
  When the lord of rākṣasas, Rāvaṇa, advanced to face Arjuna, a fierce wind
  blew, accompanied by roaring, and ominous portents arose.
'22': >-
  At once a single dreadful tumult was raised, blood-red as it were, borne along
  by clouds—by Mahodara, Mahāpārśva, Dhūmrākṣa, and by Śuka and Sāraṇa.
'23': >-
  Surrounded thus, the rākṣasa-lord went to the place where Arjuna was. And in
  no long time that mighty rākṣasa, dark as collyrium, reached that terrible
  pool of the Narmadā.
'24': >-
  There the king of the rākṣasas saw Arjuna, the lord among men—encircled by
  women—like an elephant beset by she-elephants in rut.
'25': >-
  Then the lord of rākṣasas, his eyes reddened with wrath and swollen with
  strength, (advanced in fury).
'26': >-
  And thus, in a deep voice, he addressed Arjuna’s ministers: “Ministers,
  quickly inform the Haihaya king!”
'27': >-
  “A rākṣasa named Rāvaṇa has arrived, seeking battle.” Hearing the words of
  Rāvaṇa, those counselors of Arjuna rose up with their weapons and missiles,
  and spoke words to Rāvaṇa.
'28': >-
  “The proper time for battle is to be understood (and observed). Good,
  sir—good, O Rāvaṇa!”
'29': >-
  And the ministers of Arjuna said further: “He who dares to fight a king who is
  intoxicated and surrounded by women—how can you desire to fight Arjuna in the
  presence of women, when he is in their midst, excited in sport, like a tiger
  (attacking) an elephant maddened among the cries of its herd?”
'30': >-
  “Pardon (this) today, O Ten-necked one, and let this night be spent by you. If
  you have faith in battle, then tomorrow you shall meet Arjuna in combat.”
'31': >-
  “If indeed your mind, covered over with thirst for battle, is set on
  fighting—then first slay us; thereafter you shall approach battle with
  Arjuna.”
'32': >-
  Then, in battle, the ministers of that king were smitten by the ministers of
  Rāvaṇa, and—being hungry—were even devoured by the ravenous rākṣasas.
'33': >-
  Then a loud cry of “halahalā” arose upon the Narmadā’s bank—from the followers
  of Arjuna and from the counselors of Rāvaṇa.
'34': >-
  With arrows, spears, spikes, tridents, and weapons like thunderbolts, they
  rushed from all sides, assailing and tormenting even the rākṣasas with Rāvaṇa
  among them.
'35': >-
  The onset of the warriors of the Haihaya king was exceedingly
  terrible—resounding like the tumult of the ocean filled with crocodiles,
  fishes, and makaras.
'36': >-
  But Rāvaṇa’s ministers—Prahasta, Śuka, and Sāraṇa—enraged, consumed the might
  of Kārtavīrya’s forces with their fiery prowess.
'37': >-
  To Arjuna, who was still sporting, the deeds of Rāvaṇa and his counselors were
  reported by men who guarded the gates.
'38': >-
  Hearing this, Arjuna reassured the womenfolk, “You need not fear,” and then he
  emerged from that water—like the Sun rising from the waters of the Gaṅgā.
'39': >-
  His eyes clouded by wrath, Arjuna became like fire; exceedingly dreadful, he
  blazed forth like the consuming fire at the end of an age.
'40': >-
  Swiftly taking up his mace fitted with fine golden armlets, he rushed upon the
  rākṣasas like the sun upon darkness.
'41': >-
  Raising the great mace, causing the swinging of his arms, and assuming the
  speed of Garuḍa, Arjuna leapt forward as an arrow released from a bow.
'42': >-
  Blocking his path, like a mountain obstructing the sun, stood Prahasta, with a
  club as his weapon—immovable, like the Vindhya mountain.
'43': >-
  Then Prahasta, mighty and enraged, hurled his dreadful club, bound with iron;
  and he roared like a thundercloud.
'44': >-
  At the front of that club, released from Prahasta’s hand, there appeared a
  blazing fire—like the crest of an aśoka tree—seeming as though it would burn
  everything.
'45': >-
  But as that club came rushing on, Kārtavīrya Arjuna—mace in hand, of
  irresistible valor—skillfully avoided it.
'46': >-
  Then the lord of the Haihayas charged at Prahasta, whirling his heavy
  mace—towering as high as five hundred arms.
'47': >-
  Smitten by that mace with tremendous speed, Prahasta fell then—like a standing
  mountain struck down by Indra’s thunderbolt.
'48': >-
  Seeing Prahasta fallen, Mārīca, Śuka, and Sāraṇa, together with Mahodara and
  Dhūmrākṣa, fled from the field of battle.
'49': >-
  When his ministers had retreated and Prahasta had been struck down, Rāvaṇa
  swiftly rushed upon Arjuna, the foremost of kings.
'50': >-
  Then began that dreadful, hair-raising battle between the thousand-armed one
  and the twenty-armed one—the king and the rākṣasa.
'51': >-
  They were like two enraged oceans; like two mountains with shaking roots; like
  two suns endowed with fiery splendor; like two blazing fires that burn.
'52': >-
  Uplifted by strength like two mighty elephants; like two bulls intent on
  mating; roaring like clouds; like two lions fierce in power.
'53': >-
  Like Rudra and Kāla in fury, those two—rākṣasa and Arjuna—struck each other
  fiercely with their maces.
'54': >-
  As mountains endure fearful blows of the thunderbolt, so did those two—the man
  and the rākṣasa—endure the strokes of the mace there.
'55': >-
  Just as an echo arises in response to thunder, so all the directions resounded
  with the reverberations of their mace-blows.
'56': >-
  Arjuna’s mace, as it was brought down upon the enemy’s chest, made the sky
  glow golden—like a flashing lightning-bolt.
'57': >-
  In the same way, Rāvaṇa too, striking again and again, made his mace shine
  upon Arjuna’s chest like a fiery meteor upon a great mountain.
'58': >-
  Neither Arjuna grew weary, nor the lord of the rākṣasa host. Their battle was
  like that of the mighty Indra of old (in former times).
'59': >-
  Like bulls fighting with their horns, like elephants with their tusk-tips,
  those two best of man and rākṣasa struck each other again and again.
'60': >-
  Then Arjuna, enraged, with all his might, hurled that mace into the broad
  chest of Rāvaṇa, between his breasts.
'61': >-
  Yet upon Rāvaṇa’s chest, protected by boons, that mace—its force as though
  weakened—split into two and fell to the earth.
'62': >-
  But Rāvaṇa, struck by the fall of the mace hurled by Arjuna, recoiled the
  length of a bowshot, sat down, and groaned.
'63': >-
  Seeing Daśagrīva thus stunned, Arjuna sprang up at once and seized him—like
  Garuḍa seizing a serpent.
'64': >-
  Then the powerful king, forcibly grasping Daśānana with his thousand arms,
  bound him—just as Nārāyaṇa bound Bali.
'65': >-
  As Daśagrīva was being bound, siddhas, cāraṇas, and divine beings, crying
  “Well done!”, rained flowers upon Arjuna’s head.
'66': >-
  Like a tiger carrying off a deer, like the lord of beasts (a lion) carrying
  off an elephant, the Haihaya king roared again and again with joy, like a
  rumbling cloud.
'67': >-
  Prahasta, having recovered somewhat, saw Daśānana bound; then, together with
  those rākṣasas, enraged, he rushed upon the king.
'68': >-
  The speed of those night-rangers as they fell upon him was like that of
  rain-clouds upon the ocean when the heat of day has passed and swelling has
  arisen.
'69': >-
  Crying repeatedly, “Release him! Release him!” and “Stand! Stand!” they hurled
  clubs and spears at Arjuna.
'70': >-
  Before those weapons could even reach him, Arjuna—unconfused—seized the
  weapons of those enemies of the immortals, the destroyer of foes.
'71': >-
  With those very weapons—difficult to withstand—he shattered the rākṣasas and
  drove them away, as the wind scatters clouds.
'72': >-
  Having thus terrified the rākṣasas, Kārtavīrya Arjuna then, seizing Rāvaṇa,
  entered the city, surrounded by his friends.
'73': >-
  Praised and showered with heaps of flowers and grains of unbroken rice by
  brahmins and townsmen, resembling Puruhūta (Indra), Arjuna then entered that
  city—like the thousand-eyed Indra entering (heaven) after subduing Bali.
'74': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-second canto, called “The Seizure of Rāvaṇa,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
