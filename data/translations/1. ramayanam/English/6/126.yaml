  Then, in the revered Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Yuddha-kanda, the one hundred
  and twenty-sixth canto, entitled “The Description of the Route on the Return
  (Journey),” begins.
'1': >-
  Then, with Rama’s permission, that peerless aerial car—yoked with swans and
  resounding with a mighty sound—soared up into the sky.
'2': >-
  Thereafter, the delight of the Raghus (Rama), casting his gaze on all sides,
  spoke to Maithili Sita, whose face was like the moon.
'3': >-
  “Behold, O Vaidehi, Lanka, situated upon the peak of Trikuta, resembling the
  summit of Kailasa, fashioned by Vishvakarman.”
'4': >-
  “See this battlefield, Sita, a mire of flesh and blood—this great destruction
  of vanaras and rakshasas.”
'5': >-
  “There lies the lord of rakshasas, Ravana, the disturber (of the worlds),
  granted boons—slain by me for your sake, O large-eyed one.”
'6': >-
  “Here Kumbhakarna was slain, and the night-roaming rakshasa Prahasta; and here
  Dhumraksha was slain by the vanara Hanuman.”
'7': >-
  “Here Vidyunmali was killed by the great-souled Sushena; and here in battle
  Indrajit—Ravaṇi—was slain by Lakshmana.”
'8': >-
  “Here Angada slew the rakshasa named Vikata; and Virupaksha, hard to look
  upon; and the two, Mahaparshva and Mahodara.”
'9': >-
  “Akampana too was slain, and other mighty rakshasas as well; and Trishiras and
  Atikaya; and Devantaka and Narantaka.”
'10': >-
  “And the two foremost among rakshasas, maddened and crazed for war; and
  Nikumbha and Kumbha—powerful sons of Kumbhakarna.”
'11': >-
  “Vajradramṣṭra and Daṃṣṭra, and many rakshasas besides, were slain; and
  Makaraksha, difficult to assail, was laid low by me in battle.”
'12': >-
  “Akampana was slain, and the valiant Shonitaksha; and Yupaksha and Prajangha
  were slain in that great combat.”
'13': >-
  “Here Vidyujjihva, a rakshasa of terrible aspect, was slain; and Yajnashatru
  was slain; and Suptaghna, of great might, was slain.”
'14': >-
  “Suryashatru was slain, and likewise another, Brahmashatru. Here Mandodari,
  his wife, lamented for him.”
'15': >-
  “Surrounded by a full thousand co-wives, O fair-faced one—there may be seen
  here the sacred ford of the ocean.”
'16': >-
  “It was here that, having crossed up from the sea, we passed that night. This
  is the causeway I had built upon the salty ocean.”
'17': >-
  “For your sake, O large-eyed one, this Nala-bridge—most difficult to
  accomplish—(was made). Behold the unagitated sea, O Vaidehi, the abode of
  Varuna.”
'18': >-
  “Seeming boundless as it roars, filled with conches and oyster-shells—behold,
  O Maithili, that golden lord of mountains, Hiranyanabha.”
'19': >-
  “This is the encampment and resting-place—risen from cleaving the ocean—for
  Hanuman’s repose, upon the ocean’s bosom.”
'20': >-
  “Here formerly the all-powerful Mahadeva bestowed his grace. This sacred ford
  of the great-souled ocean is to be seen here.”
'21': >-
  “Renowned as Setubandha and revered by the three worlds—this is supremely
  holy, the destroyer of the greatest sins.”
'22': >-
  “Here came this king of rakshasas, Vibhishana. That very Kishkindha, of
  wondrous groves, is seen there, O Sita.”
'23': >-
  “That is Sugriva’s delightful city, where Vali was slain by me.” Then Sita,
  beholding Kishkindha, protected by Vali (in former days),—
'24': >-
  —spoke to Rama, with humble words, with affectionate confidence and loving
  trust: “O king, (I wish to go) with Tara at the head, and with the beloved
  wives of Sugriva,”
'25': >-
  “and with the wives of other lords of vanaras surrounding me. I desire to go
  with you to Ayodhya, your capital-city.”
'26': >-
  Thus addressed by Vaidehi, Raghava replied to her, “So be it.” Then, having
  reached Kishkindha and having duly established matters there, Raghava—
'27': >-
  —looking at Sugriva in the aerial car, spoke these words: “Speak, O tiger
  among vanaras, to all the foremost of vanaras,”
'28': >-
  “let them all, accompanied by their wives, go to Ayodhya with Sita; and you
  too, O mighty one, along with all your wives.”
'29': >-
  “Make haste, Sugriva; let us go, O lord of the plavagas.” Thus spoken to by
  Rama of immeasurable splendor,
'30': >-
  Sugriva, the illustrious lord of vanaras, surrounded by all those (chiefs),
  quickly entered the inner apartments; and seeing Tara, he said:
'31': >-
  “Beloved, you—with the womenfolk of the great-souled vanaras—are permitted by
  Raghava, for Maithili’s pleasure and in fulfillment of her wish.”
'32': >-
  “Hasten; let us set forth, taking the vanara women. We shall show all of you
  Ayodhya, and (also) all the wives of Dasharatha.”
'33': >-
  Hearing Sugriva’s words, Tara, lovely in every limb, summoned and addressed
  all the women of the vanaras:
'34': >-
  “Permitted by Sugriva and by all the vanaras to go—this too is dear to me: the
  beholding of Ayodhya,”
'35': >-
  “and the entry of Rama along with the citizens and countryfolk, and also the
  prosperity and splendor of all the women of Dasharatha.”
'36': >-
  Permitted by Tara, all the vanara women—having first arranged their adornment
  and attire as prescribed, and having also performed circumambulation—
'37': >-
  mounted that aerial car, longing to behold Sita. Seeing the chariot rise
  swiftly with them, Raghava—
'38': >-
  —near Rishyamuka again spoke to Vaidehi: “There is seen, O Sita, that great
  cloud, as it were, with lightning.”
'39': >-
  “(That is) Mount Rishyamuka, the excellent mountain, clad in golden minerals.
  Here I met with Sugriva, lord of vanaras.”
'40': >-
  “And an agreement was made, O Sita, by me—for the slaying of Vali. There is
  seen that very Pampa, lotus-filled, with wondrous woods.”
'41': >-
  “Bereft of you, there I lamented, afflicted with grievous sorrow. On its bank
  I saw Shabari, who practiced dharma.”
'42': >-
  “Here I slew Kabandha, whose arms were a yojana long. There is seen, in
  Janasthana, O Sita, that splendid tree.”
'43': >-
  “And Jatayu, of great splendor, for your sake, O graceful one—there, the
  mighty foremost of birds was slain by Ravana.”
'44': >-
  “There Khara was slain, and Dushana was struck down; and Trishiras, the great
  hero, by my arrows that went unerringly.”
'45': >-
  “That is the site of our hermitage, O lady of excellent complexion; and the
  charming leaf-hut is seen there, O auspicious-looking one—”
'46': >-
  “where you were carried off by force by Ravana, lord of rakshasas. This is the
  delightful Godavari, with clear and auspicious waters.”
'47': >-
  “And there is seen Agastya’s hermitage, encircled by banana groves; and this
  is the radiant hermitage of the great-souled Sutikshna.”
'48': >-
  “And there is seen, O Vaidehi, the great hermitage of Sharabhanga—where
  Shakra, the thousand-eyed Purandara, came.”
'49': >-
  “In this region the huge-bodied Viradha was slain by me. These are those
  ascetics, O goddess, O slender-waisted one, to be seen here.”
'50': >-
  “Where Atri, the head of the clan, is—radiant like the sun and the sacrificial
  fire. Here, O Sita, you saw the female ascetic who practiced dharma.”
'51': >-
  “There, O fair-limbed one, the lord of mountains Chitrakuta shines forth. Here
  the son of Kaikeyi came to appease me.”
'52': >-
  “This is the delightful Yamuna, with wondrous woods, to be seen; and here too,
  O Maithili, is the splendid hermitage of Bharadwaja.”
'53': >-
  “And this is seen—the Ganga, holy, the river that flows in three paths—filled
  with many flocks of birds, its groves in full bloom.”
'54': >-
  “And this is Shrimgaverapura, where Guha, my friend, dwelt. This is seen, O
  Sita—the Sarayu, adorned with sacrificial posts.”
'55': >-
  “This is seen, O Sita—the capital of my father. O Vaidehi, returned again,
  offer your reverent salutation to Ayodhya.”
'56': >-
  Then all those vanaras and rakshasas, with Vibhishana, leaping up again and
  again in joy, beheld that city.
'57': >-
  Then the plavagas, together with the rakshasas, saw that city—garlanded with
  pale-white mansions, with broad highways, thronged with elephants and
  horses—like Amaravati, the city of great Indra.
'58': >-
  Thus ends, in the sacred, illustrious Ramayana of Valmiki—the first epic—in
  the Yuddha-kanda, the one hundred and twenty-sixth canto, entitled “The
  Description of the Route on the Return (Journey).”
