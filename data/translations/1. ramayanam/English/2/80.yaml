  Now begins the eightieth canto in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Preparation and Beautification of the Route
  (Mārga-saṃskāra).”
'1': >-
  Then there set forth men who knew well the regions and the lay of the
  land—skilled in the work of surveying and marking the route—heroes devoted to
  their respective duties: diggers, and craftsmen expert in mechanical
  contrivances as well.
'2': >-
  And there were master-builders ever intent upon their tasks, men versed in
  instruments and engineering; also road-makers and builders, trackers of
  pathways, and wood-cutters who felled and shaped trees.
'3': >-
  There were makers of wells, workers in plaster and mortar, and craftsmen
  skilled in bamboo-work; and all those capable overseers and
  inspectors—competent men—set out in advance at the front.
'4': >-
  And, out of delight, a vast multitude of people went forth toward that
  appointed region; moving with great speed, that surging crowd shone forth like
  the ocean when it swells at the time of the full tide.
'5': >-
  Those experts in road-works, taking their turns in proper order, set out
  ahead, equipped with implements of many kinds for the various tasks.
'6': >-
  Cutting down climbers and creepers, thickets, tree-stumps, and even stones,
  those people made the road, hewing and lopping diverse trees.
'7': >-
  And in places that were without trees, some planted trees; while others, in
  different spots, cut away with axes, picks, and sickles.
'8': >-
  Others again—strong men, even stronger than the rest—cleared away clumps of
  vīraṇa-grass, and broke through difficult tracts and rugged ground here and
  there.
'9': >-
  Others filled up wells and long deep pits with earth; and some leveled the
  low-lying portions, making the ground even on every side.
'10': >-
  Then some bound fast what needed binding, and crushed down what required
  pounding; and men split and cut through those regions that needed to be opened
  and cleft.
'11': >-
  And in no long time they made many channels carrying abundant water, of
  manifold forms—many reservoirs and water-works resembling the sea itself.
'12': >-
  And in waterless regions they dug excellent wells of many kinds, adorned all
  around with raised platforms (vedikās).
'13': >-
  Paved with plastered and well-laid flooring, with the earth covered in
  blossoming plants, resonant with the calls of intoxicated, clamorous flocks of
  birds, and embellished with banners—thus was the way prepared.
'14': >-
  Sprinkled with sandal-scented water and decked with flowers of many sorts, the
  roadway of the army shone exceedingly—like a path to heaven.
'15': >-
  Then, having issued commands, those appointed officers—duly engaged according
  to the directions given—made arrangements in delightful regions abounding in
  many sweet fruits.
'16': >-
  And whatever camping-ground was desired for the great-souled Bharata, that
  they further beautified with ornaments and adornments, like a person decked
  with jewels.
'17': >-
  And those who knew the auspicious science of times and seasons established the
  encampment of the great-souled Bharata under propitious constellations and in
  favorable muhūrtas.
'18': >-
  There were also great heaps of earth, and encircling trenches; and gateways
  well adorned, with tall posts like Indra’s banner-poles (indrakīlas), set up
  as standards.
'19': >-
  All the great roads were excellently built—furnished with rows of mansions and
  terraces, enclosed by lofty ramparts and palace-walls, and made splendid with
  fluttering flags.
'20': >-
  Those encampments rose high, like cities of Śakra (Indra), with their pointed,
  projecting pinnacles and aerial-like platforms seeming to move across the sky.
'21': >-
  And having reached the Jāhnavī (the Gaṅgā)—with groves of diverse trees—cool,
  pure, and fit for drinking, and teeming with great fishes—(they proceeded
  along its banks).
'22': >-
  As the stainless sky in the night shines adorned with the moon and hosts of
  stars, so too that royal highway shone forth—fair in due succession, and
  fashioned auspiciously by skilled artisans.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the eightieth canto in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, named “The Preparation and
  Beautification of the Route (Mārga-saṃskāra).”
