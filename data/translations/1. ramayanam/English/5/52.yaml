  Then, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa, the fifty-second
  chapter, entitled “Preventing the Slaying of the Messenger.”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of that great-souled Vānara, Rāvaṇa—overwhelmed by
  wrath—commanded that he be put to death.
'2': >-
  When that order for his execution had been issued by the wicked Rāvaṇa,
  Vibhīṣaṇa did not approve of the killing of one who had come as an envoy and
  had declared his embassy.
'3': >-
  Knowing the lord of the rākṣasas to be enraged, and perceiving that the matter
  had reached such a critical point, Vibhīṣaṇa—steadfast in the proper course of
  action—began to reflect upon what ought to be done.
'4': >-
  Having come to a firm conclusion, that eloquent speaker then addressed, with
  conciliation, his venerable elder brother, the conqueror of foes, speaking
  words that were greatly and truly beneficial.
'5': >-
  “Forgive this anger; abandon your wrath, O lord of the rākṣasas. Be gracious,
  and hear these words of mine: the wise—those who know what is proper and
  improper—righteous kings, lords of the earth, do not slay a messenger.”
'6': >-
  “O King, to kill this monkey would be contrary to dharma, condemned by the
  usage of the world, and unbefitting you, O hero.”
'7': >-
  “You alone are learned in dharma and mindful of benefits received; you are
  skilled in the king’s duties; you know what is higher and what is lower among
  beings; you are the knower of the highest truth.”
'8': >-
  “If even discerning men such as you are seized by anger, then what remains of
  insight into the śāstras is, indeed, mere toil and nothing more.”
'9': >-
  “Therefore be gracious, O slayer of foes, O rākṣasa-lord, hard to assail.
  Having properly determined what is fitting and what is not, let the punishment
  of the messenger be ordained accordingly.”
'10': >-
  Hearing Vibhīṣaṇa’s words, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, possessed by a great
  fury, spoke this reply:
'11': >-
  “In slaying the wicked, there is no sin, O destroyer of enemies. Therefore I
  shall kill this monkey who has committed evil.”
'12': >-
  Having heard that utterance—rooted in adharma, fraught with many faults, and
  followed by the ignoble—Vibhīṣaṇa, foremost among the बुद्धिमान् (the wise),
  spoke words that conveyed the true essence of the highest truth.
'13': >-
  “Be gracious, O lord of Laṅkā, O king of the rākṣasas; hear a statement
  grounded in dharma and artha: messengers are not to be slain. Thus do the
  righteous declare, at all times, everywhere, in every case, O King.”
'14': >-
  “Without doubt this one is a mighty and grown enemy; by him an immeasurable
  offense, something most displeasing, has been done. Yet the righteous do not
  declare that a messenger should be slain, for many kinds of punishments for a
  messenger are indeed known.”
'15': >-
  “Deformity of the limbs, lashes with whips, shaving of the head, and also the
  branding or marking upon the body—these are the punishments that are
  prescribed for a messenger; but as for the slaying of a messenger, we have not
  heard of it.”
'16': >-
  “How could one like you—whose understanding is disciplined by dharma and
  artha, whose judgment is firmly settled through knowledge of what is higher
  and lower—remain under the power of anger? For the steadfast do not fall into
  wrath.”
'17': >-
  “Neither in discourse on dharma, nor in the customs of the world, nor even in
  the grasp of scriptural reasoning—does there exist anyone equal to you, O
  hero. For you are the foremost among all gods and asuras.”
'18': >-
  “By you—immeasurable in might, unconquerable even by the valor, energy, and
  pride of gods and asuras—hosts of Indra-like gods and many kings have
  repeatedly been conquered in battles.”
'19': >-
  “For such a one as you—enemy of the immortals and daityas, a brave hero,
  undefeated—no valiant man would even conceive a falsehood within his mind;
  those who have not previously been freed of life-breath before you do so only
  after their lives are relinquished.”
'20': >-
  “Moreover, in the killing of this monkey I see no benefit at all. Let that
  punishment fall upon those by whom this monkey was sent.”
'21': >-
  “Whether he be good or bad, if he has been delivered by others and speaks for
  another’s purpose, being under another’s authority, a messenger does not
  deserve to be slain.”
'22': >-
  “And besides, O King, if he were slain, I do not see any other sky-going being
  here who could come again to this place from the far shore of the great
  ocean.”
'23': >-
  “Therefore, O conqueror of enemy cities, no effort should be made to kill him.
  It is for you—against Indra and the gods—that effort ought to be undertaken.”
'24': >-
  “If this one is destroyed, I do not see any other being who would rouse those
  two princes, the sons of the king, those ill-disciplined warriors who delight
  in battle, to come to war against you.”
'25': >-
  “By you—hard to conquer even for the valor, energy, and pride of gods and
  asuras—O delight of the naiṛtas (rākṣasas), it is not fitting to set about
  destroying the rākṣasas by engaging in war.”
'26': >-
  “There are warriors who are well-wishers, heroic, and composed; born in noble
  lineages endowed with great qualities; high-minded, foremost among
  weapon-bearers; renowned for righteous anger, well-supported, and excellent
  fighters.”
'27': >-
  “Let some portion of that force, acting today under your command, go forth.
  Seizing those two princes—foolish as they are—let them make your power felt
  among your enemies.”
'28': >-
  The lord of the night-rangers, the mighty foremost king of the rākṣasas—enemy
  of the world of the gods—accepted with his understanding the pleasing and
  excellent counsel of his younger brother Vibhīṣaṇa.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-second chapter of Sundara-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “Preventing the Slaying of the Messenger.”
