  Now begins, in the illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, the
  sixty-fifth canto, entitled “The Attainment of the State of a Brahmarṣi.”
'1': >-
  Then, O Rāma, the great ascetic, leaving behind the Himālaya region, went to
  the eastern quarter and there undertook exceedingly severe austerities.
'2': >-
  Having observed for a thousand years the unsurpassed vow of silence, he
  performed, O Rāma, incomparable penance—most difficult to accomplish.
'3': >-
  But when the thousand years were complete, and the great sage had become like
  a piece of dry wood, shaken by many impediments, wrath found no entrance into
  his heart.
'4': >-
  Having thus formed his resolve, O Rāma, he maintained that unfailing
  austerity; and when the vow of that thousand-year observance was fulfilled,
  that great observer of vows—
'5': >-
  —began at that time, O best of the Raghus, to partake of food. Then Indra,
  assuming the form of a twice-born Brahmin, begged from him that prepared and
  sanctified fare.
'6': >-
  Resolutely he gave to that Brahmin all the food that had been made ready; and
  when the food was entirely exhausted, the blessed great ascetic remained
  without eating at all.
'7': >-
  He spoke not a word to the Brahmin, steadfast in his vow of silence. And again
  he resumed that same silence, and ceased even to breathe.
'8': >-
  Then for another thousand years, not breathing, that foremost of sages
  remained. And as he continued without breath, smoke arose from the crown of
  his head.
'9': >-
  By that smoke the three worlds were thrown into confusion, as though scorched
  by heat. Thereupon devas, divine seers, Gandharvas, serpents, Nāgas, and
  Rākṣasas—
'10': >-
  —all of them, deluded by the power of his austerity, their radiance
  diminished, and stricken with distress, addressed the Grandsire, Brahmā,
  saying:
'11': >-
  “For many reasons, O God, Viśvāmitra, the great sage, is at once enticed,
  enraged, and continually increases in power through his austerities.
'12': >-
  “In him no fault is seen—not even the slightest. Yet if what he desires in his
  mind is not granted—
'13': >-
  —he will destroy the three worlds, with all that moves and all that is
  unmoving, by his tapas. All the quarters are distressed, and nothing shines
  forth in clarity.
'14': >-
  “All the oceans are agitated; the mountains are shattered; the earth trembles;
  and the wind blows here in tumult.
'15': >-
  “O Brahmā, we do not know—will mankind become unbelieving? The three worlds
  seem as though bewildered, their minds utterly convulsed.
'16': >-
  “Even the sun is rendered lustreless by the radiance of that great seer. O
  God, unless you resolve upon a course, there will be ruin, O great sage.
'17': >-
  “Then, O Blessed One, there will be favor only in the form of fire of great
  splendor—so that, like the fire at the end of time, the whole threefold world
  would be consumed entirely.
'18': >-
  “He may even seek sovereignty over the gods; therefore let that which is in
  his mind be granted.” Then all the hosts of the gods, with the Grandsire at
  their head—
'19': >-
  —spoke sweet words to the great-souled Viśvāmitra: “O Brahmarṣi, welcome to
  you! By your austerities we are well pleased.
'20': >-
  “By fierce penance, O Kauśika, you have attained Brahminhood. And, O Brahman,
  I grant you long life—together with all the Marut hosts.”
'21': >-
  “Prosperity be yours; welfare to you. Go, gentle one, as you please.” Hearing
  the words of the Grandsire, spoken in the presence of all the dwellers of
  heaven,
'22': >-
  the great sage, delighted, made obeisance and said: “If Brahminhood has indeed
  been attained by me, and long life as well—
'23': >-
  —then let Oṃkāra and the exclamation Vaṣaṭ, and the Vedas, acknowledge me; let
  me be the foremost among those who know the Kṣatra-veda, and among those who
  know the Brahma-veda as well.
'24': >-
  “And let Vasiṣṭha, son of Brahmā, speak of me thus before the gods. If so,
  then my highest desire is fulfilled; let the best of the gods depart.”
'25': >-
  Thereupon Vasiṣṭha, the foremost among those who mutter sacred prayers, being
  satisfied by the gods, entered into friendship with him, and said, “So be it.”
'26': >-
  “You are a Brahmarṣi—there is no doubt. Everything shall be accomplished for
  you.” Having thus spoken, all the deities too departed, each returning as he
  had come.
'27': >-
  And Viśvāmitra, righteous-souled, having obtained the supreme status of
  Brahminhood, honored Vasiṣṭha—the Brahmarṣi, the best of those who recite
  prayers.
'28': >-
  His desire fulfilled, he ranged over the whole earth, abiding in austerity.
  Thus, O Rāma, did that great-souled one attain Brahminhood.
'29': >-
  “This, O Rāma, is the foremost of sages; this is austerity embodied; this is
  the eternal highest dharma; and this is the supreme refuge of valor.”
'30': >-
  Having spoken thus, that great and radiant best of twice-born ones fell
  silent, in the presence of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, after they had heard the words
  of Śatānanda.
'31': >-
  Then Janaka, with hands joined in reverence, addressed the son of Kuśika:
  “Blessed am I; graced am I, O foremost of sages—
'32': >-
  —since you, O Kauśika, have come to my sacrifice together with the scion of
  Kakutstha. I am purified by you, O Brahman, by your very sight, O great sage.
'33': >-
  Many and manifold virtues have I gained from beholding you; and, O Brahman,
  that great austerity has been recounted in full detail.
'34': >-
  It has been heard by me, O greatly radiant one, and by great-souled Rāma as
  well; and when we reached this sacrificial assembly, many of your excellences
  were heard by the assembled priests.
'35': >-
  Immeasurable is your austerity; immeasurable too is your might; immeasurable
  likewise are your virtues—ever so, O son of Kuśika.
'36': >-
  My satisfaction in these wondrous narratives is not complete, O lord. Yet the
  time for the rites draws on, and the disk of the sun is sinking.
'37': >-
  Tomorrow at dawn, O greatly radiant one, you should see me again. Welcome, O
  best of those who recite prayers; be pleased to grant me leave.
'38': >-
  Thus addressed, the best of sages, praising that bull among men, quickly
  dismissed Janaka then—Janaka whose mind was glad and gladdened.
'39': >-
  Having thus spoken to the foremost of sages, the Videhan king, lord of
  Mithilā, at once circumambulated him reverently, along with his preceptor, his
  kinsmen, and his companions.
'40': >-
  And Viśvāmitra too, righteous-souled, together with Rāma and with Lakṣmaṇa,
  proceeded to his own dwelling, being honored by the great-souled ones.
'41': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fifth canto, entitled “The Attainment of the State of a
  Brahmarṣi,” in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic.
