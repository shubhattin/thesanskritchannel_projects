  Now begins the twenty‑third sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa in the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “Lakṣmaṇa’s Wrath.”
'1': >-
  While Rāma was speaking thus, Lakṣmaṇa—his head bowed down—sank at once into
  deep reflection, suddenly passing into a state midway between despondency and
  exultation.
'2': >-
  Then indeed, that bull among men, knitting his brows in the middle of his
  forehead, heaved a long, hot breath—like a great serpent enraged within its
  burrow.
'3': >-
  His face then, with the brows thus drawn together and hard to look upon,
  appeared like the face of a lion when angered.
'4': >-
  Shaking his foremost hand as an elephant shakes its own trunk, and letting the
  line of his head and neck droop down and sideways over his body,
'5': >-
  he looked at his brother from the corner of his eye and spoke: “A very great
  confusion has arisen in you without any proper occasion!
'6': >-
  Out of anxiety about the world’s censure and from the entanglement of what is
  dharma and what is fault in dharma, how could one such as you, unbewildered,
  ever speak like this?
'7': >-
  How can a valorous, best of kṣatriyas, utter such unmanly words? Why do you
  speak of ‘fate’ as though it were a pitiable power, helpless and weak?
'8': >-
  How is it that you have no suspicion at all regarding those two sinners? They
  are attached to dharma only as a disguise—O righteous-souled one, do you not
  understand this?
'9': >-
  If those two, desiring to snatch away their own advantage by deceit, had not
  already resolved upon this, then, O Rāghava, the boon would long ago have been
  bestowed on them, and that very plan would have been set in motion long
  before.
'10': >-
  This undertaking—to consecrate another in your place—has become hateful to the
  world. O hero, I am not able to endure it; there you must pardon me.
'11': >-
  Even that ‘dharma’ by which such a divided thought has come into your mind, O
  great-minded one—even that dharma is hateful to me, since by its occasion you
  are being deluded.
'12': >-
  How can you, who are capable through your own action, carry out your father’s
  word—an unrighteous and blameworthy command—when he is under the sway of
  Kaikeyī?
'13': >-
  That such a breach has been made through wrongdoing, and yet is accepted as if
  it were right—this gives rise to my sorrow there, and to a deplorable
  entanglement in the very name of dharma.
'14': >-
  This association of yours with such ‘dharma’ is censured by the people of this
  world. How could men who follow their own desires even in thought wish to aid
  you—when those two, ever intent on harming you, are like enemies, though
  called ‘father’ and ‘mother’?
'15': >-
  Even if your course is in accord with divine ordinance and also with what
  those two desire, still it ought to be disregarded by you; even that does not
  please me.
'16': >-
  He who is faint-hearted and bereft of valor follows fate; but heroes, men of
  proven worth, do not propitiate fate.
'17': >-
  The man who by human effort is able to overpower fate—he does not sink down
  when his purpose is thwarted by fate.
'18': >-
  Today they shall see the might of fate and the might of a man; today the
  distinction between fate and human effort will become manifest.
'19': >-
  Today people shall see fate struck down by my manly effort—those by whom, as
  though smitten by fate, your consecration was seen to be ruined.
'20': >-
  As one turns back by force an ungoverned elephant, maddened and streaming with
  ichor, so shall I drive back fate by my own valor.
'21': >-
  Not all the guardians of the world together could today prevent Rāma’s
  consecration—nor even all the three worlds in their entirety; what then of
  your father?
'22': >-
  Those by whom, O King, your exile to the forest has been mutually
  contrived—they shall dwell in the forest for fourteen years likewise.
'23': >-
  I shall burn up that hope of your father and of her—that hope which stands in
  the way of your consecration, aimed at sovereignty for her son.
'24': >-
  Opposed by my strength, the strength of fate will not be so effective; my
  fierce manliness will prove sufficient to bring them grief.
'25': >-
  After the completion of a thousand years—and after having duly protected the
  subjects in the meantime—then, only when you are gone, will the noble princes
  undertake forest-dwelling.
'26': >-
  For forest-dwelling is spoken of according to the ancient practice of royal
  sages—after entrusting the subjects to their sons, who protect them as their
  own children.
'27': >-
  But if, O Rāma, righteous-souled one, you do not desire the kingdom for
  yourself because you fear disorder in the realm with many claimants among the
  royal kṣatriyas,
'28': >-
  I swear to you, O hero: may I never obtain the worlds attained by heroes if I
  do not protect your kingdom like the ocean’s shore (a firm boundary)!
'29': >-
  Do you have yourself consecrated with auspicious rites, and be engaged in that
  task. I alone am sufficient to restrain the kings of the earth by force.
'30': >-
  These two arms of mine are not for mere ornament, nor is my bow for
  decoration; my sword is not for wearing in its baldric, nor are my arrows
  meant only to stand unused.
'31': >-
  This entire set of four is for the crushing of hostile foes; and I do not at
  all desire that anyone should be deemed my enemy (and so escape the due
  consequence).
'32': >-
  With this sharp-edged sword, flashing like quivering lightning, when I seize
  it, I do not regard an enemy—even if he were Indra himself, wielder of the
  thunderbolt—as a match.
'33': >-
  This earth shall become a dense, hard-to-pass thicket, strewn with heads and
  thighs of elephants, horses, and charioteers—ground down by the pounding of
  the sword.
'34': >-
  Smitten by the edge of my sword, my enemies shall fall upon the earth today
  like blazing fires—like clouds with lightning (crashing down).
'35': >-
  When I stand here, wearing the finger-guards of bound iguana-leather and
  holding the bow with arrows in readiness, how could any man who prides himself
  on being a man still maintain that pride?
'36': >-
  Aiming many (arrows) at one, and with one (arrow) striking down many men, I
  shall discharge my shafts into the vital spots of men, horses, and elephants.
'37': >-
  Today the power of my weapons shall prove its power—to make the king’s mastery
  impotent and to establish your mastery, O lord.
'38': >-
  Today there shall be the loosening of bracelets wrought of sandal-essence, and
  the release of treasures, and the protection of friends.
'39': >-
  These two arms are well-matched for the work, O Rāma, that is to be done: the
  restraining of those who would cause an obstruction to your consecration.
'40': >-
  Tell me: who today—this very day—shall by me be separated from his own
  kinsmen, from those dear to him in life and fame? In whatever way this earth
  may come under your control, in that very way command me—I am your servant.
'41': >-
  Wiping away his tears and repeatedly consoling Lakṣmaṇa, that increaser of the
  glory of the Raghu line said: “Understand me, gentle one—firmly resolved as I
  am to abide by my father’s word; this indeed is the true path.”
'42': >-
  Thus ends the twenty‑third sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “Lakṣmaṇa’s Wrath.”
