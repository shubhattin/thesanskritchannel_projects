  Then, in the blessed Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa, is the
  sixty-sixth sarga, called “The Inquiry concerning Sītā’s Words.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by Hanumān, Rāma, the son of Daśaratha, took that jewel to his
  heart and, together with Lakṣmaṇa, wept.
'2': >-
  But when Rāghava—worn down by sorrow—beheld that most excellent jewel, with
  both eyes filled with tears he spoke these words to Sugrīva:
'3': >-
  “Just as a cow, out of affection, lets her milk flow, being tenderly devoted
  to her calf—so too my own heart melts upon the sight of this best of jewels.”
'4': >-
  “This jewel-gem was given to Vaidehī by my father-in-law at the time of her
  marriage; bound upon her head, it shines with surpassing beauty.”
'5': >-
  “This jewel indeed arose from the waters, and is venerated by the foremost. In
  a sacrifice, the wise Śakra (Indra), being supremely pleased, bestowed it.”
'6': >-
  “By seeing this best of jewels—like a sight of my father himself—today, gentle
  one, I understand the state of Vaidehī, and of that mighty one (Janaka), as
  well.”
'7': >-
  “This jewel of mine shines upon the head of that beloved one. By the mere
  sight of it today, I think of her as though I had truly reached her.”
'8': >-
  “What did Sītā Vaidehī say? Tell me, gentle one, again and again—watering me,
  as it were, like one almost bereft of life, with the water of your words.”
'9': >-
  “What could be more painful than this, O Saumitre—that I behold this jewel
  born of the waters, yet without Vaidehī having come with it?”
'10': >-
  “If Vaidehī shall live long—if she can endure even a month—then I, O hero,
  would not live even a moment without her, the dark-eyed one.”
'11': >-
  “Lead me also to that land where my beloved was seen. Having obtained this
  tidings, I would not remain even for an instant.”
'12': >-
  “How does she—my fair-hipped one—timid and ever timid by nature—stand there
  amid those dreadful rākṣasas, whose very presence is fearsome?”
'13': >-
  “Covered over now by clouds, like the moon freed from the darkness of autumn,
  her face surely does not shine forth at present.”
'14': >-
  “What did Sītā say, O Hanumān? Tell it to me truly; by this alone shall I
  live—like a sick man by a medicine.”
'15': >-
  “My lady of sweet speech and sweet words—what did she say? Deprived of me,
  that fair-limbed one—O Hanumān, tell me. Having fallen into sorrow more
  grievous than sorrow itself, how does Jānakī yet live?”
'16': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-sixth sarga, named “The Inquiry concerning Sītā’s Words,”
  in the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
