  Now begins the eighteenth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Decision to Receive Vibhīṣaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, his mind serene, having heard the words of the Wind-god’s son
  (Hanumān), the unassailable hero replied—keeping within his heart what he had
  heard and understood.
'2': >-
  “I too have something to say regarding Vibhīṣaṇa. I wish to hear all of that
  (your counsel) from you who are established in what is wholesome and
  beneficial.”
'3': >-
  “One who has come with the feeling of friendship, I would never abandon in any
  way whatsoever—even if there should be some fault in him. This conduct is
  blameless among the good.”
'4': >-
  Thereupon Sugrīva, having spoken in response to those words and having
  reflected, then uttered a still more auspicious utterance—he, the bull among
  the monkeys:
'5': >-
  “Whether this night-ranger be wicked or not—what of it? What misfortune is
  this, that a man would abandon his own brother when he has fallen into
  distress?”
'6': >-
  “And who indeed would he be, for whom this one would not abandon (his
  brother)?” Having heard the Vānara-lord’s words, and looking about at them
  all,
'7': >-
  Kākutstha, slightly smiling, addressed Lakṣmaṇa of auspicious marks with these
  words—he whose prowess ever rests on truth:
'8': >-
  “Without studying the śāstras and without serving elders, it is not possible
  to speak thus, as the lord of monkeys has spoken.”
'9': >-
  “Yet there is something subtler, as it appears to me; and it is seen plainly
  in worldly affairs also, among all kings.
'10': >-
  “Those who are enemies, even though of the same lineage, and those who are
  exiles and outcasts, are spoken of as smiters in times of calamity; therefore
  this one has come here.
'11': >-
  “But those who are sinless, though of the same family, honor their own
  well-wishers. Thus, among kings, this noble one is indeed to be suspected.”
'12': >-
  “As for the fault you have mentioned—namely, the accepting of an enemy’s
  strength (and support)—there I shall expound to you according to śāstra;
  listen to this.”
'13': >-
  “This rākṣasa is neither of that sort (an enemy in disguise) nor one longing
  for a kingdom. For he will prove to be wise; therefore Vibhīṣaṇa is to be
  accepted.”
'14': >-
  “And when united with us, they (our hosts) will become untroubled and
  delighted; and this great roar will arise, and fear will come upon one side
  from the other. Thus they will perceive division (in the enemy’s ranks);
  therefore Vibhīṣaṇa is to be accepted.”
'15': >-
  “Not all brothers, dear one, are like Bharata; nor are all a father’s sons
  like me; nor are all friends like you.”
'16': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, Sugrīva—together with Lakṣmaṇa—rose up; and that
  great-minded one, bowing, spoke these words:
'17': >-
  “Know this night-ranger to have been sent by Rāvaṇa. I deem his restraint (or
  punishment) fitting, O best of the forbearing.”
'18': >-
  “This rākṣasa has come here instructed with crooked intent, to strike you when
  you are trusting—and (to strike) me too, O sinless one, when I am trusting.”
'19': >-
  “Either by Lakṣmaṇa, O mighty-armed one, or along with his counsellors, he
  should be slain; for this is Vibhīṣaṇa, the brother of the cruel Rāvaṇa.”
'20': >-
  Having spoken thus to the best of the Raghu-line, Sugrīva, lord of the army,
  skilled in speech and discerning in words, then fell silent.
'21': >-
  Rāma, having heard Sugrīva’s words and reflected upon them, then spoke a still
  more auspicious reply to that foremost of monkeys:
'22': >-
  “Whether this night-ranger be wicked or not—how could he in any way be capable
  of doing even the slightest harm to me?
'23': >-
  “Piśācas, Dānavas, Yakṣas, and even the rākṣasas upon the earth—if I so
  desired, O lord of the monkey-hosts, I could slay them with the tip of my
  finger.”
'24': >-
  “Indeed it is heard (in tradition) that a pigeon, when his enemy came seeking
  refuge, honored him as is proper and invited him with his own flesh.”
'25': >-
  “That pigeon accepted even him who had come as a stealer of his wife. O
  foremost of monkeys, how much more should a person like me (accept one who
  seeks refuge)!”
'26': >-
  “Listen to an ancient gāthā sung long ago by the great sage Kaṇḍu, son of the
  ṛṣi Kaṇva—righteous and a speaker of truth:
'27': >-
  ‘One should not slay an enemy who, with palms joined, wretched, begging, has
  come seeking refuge—(this is) for the sake of compassion, O scorcher of
  foes.’”
'28': >-
  “‘Whether in anguish or in arrogance, if one has come to another for
  shelter—an enemy, even giving up his very life, must be protected by the
  self-controlled.’”
'29': >-
  “‘If, out of fear, or delusion, or even desire, one does not protect him,
  though able, in accordance with justice—this is sin, condemned by the world.’”
'30': >-
  “‘If, while the protector looks on, one who has sought refuge perishes, then
  all the merit of that protector is taken away by the unprotected one.’”
'31': >-
  “Thus there is great fault here in not protecting those who have sought
  refuge; it is not leading to heaven, it brings disgrace, and it destroys
  strength and valor.
'32': >-
  “Therefore I shall truly carry out the excellent word of Kaṇḍu—righteous,
  fame-bestowing, and leading to heaven when its fruit comes to ripeness.”
'33': >-
  “To one who has approached but once and begs, saying, ‘I am yours’—to him I
  grant fearlessness from all beings. This is my vow.”
'34': >-
  “Bring him here, O best of monkeys; by me fearlessness has been bestowed upon
  him—whether it be Vibhīṣaṇa, O Sugrīva, or even Rāvaṇa himself.”
'35': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, Sugrīva, lord of the monkeys, replied to Kākutstha, his
  heart filled with friendship:
'36': >-
  “What wonder is there here, O knower of dharma, O crest-jewel among the
  guardians of the world, that you speak what is noble—being virtuous and
  established on the righteous path?
'37': >-
  “And my own inner self knows Vibhīṣaṇa to be pure; by inference, by his
  disposition, and by examination from every side, he is well tested.
'38': >-
  “Therefore, quickly, let that great wise Vibhīṣaṇa become one with us, O
  Rāghava, and let him enter into friendship with us.”
'39': >-
  Then, hearing the words spoken by Sugrīva, the lord of men (Rāma) quickly went
  to meet with Vibhīṣaṇa—just as Purandara (Indra) went to an encounter
  accompanied by the king of birds (Garuḍa).
'40': >-
  Thus ends the eighteenth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Decision to Receive
  Vibhīṣaṇa.”
