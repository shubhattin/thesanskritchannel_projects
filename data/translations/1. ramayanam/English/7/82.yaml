  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins
  the eighty-second chapter, called “Rāma’s Return.”
'1': >-
  Understanding the sage’s words, Rāma set about to perform the evening worship
  at twilight; and he approached that sacred lake, frequented by hosts of
  Apsarās.
'2': >-
  There, touching the water in purification and duly performing the western
  (evening) twilight-observance, Rāma entered the hermitage of the great-souled
  Agastya, the son of the pot.
'3': >-
  Agastya prepared for him, in great abundance, bulbs and roots as well as
  medicinal herbs, and also pure grains such as rice and the like, for the
  purpose of his meal.
'4': >-
  The best of men ate that food, which was like nectar; and being pleased and
  fully content, he passed that night there.
'5': >-
  At dawn, rising early and completing his daily rites, the subduer of foes, the
  foremost of the Raghus, made ready to depart, approaching the sage for leave
  to go.
'6': >-
  Having paid obeisance, Rāma said to the great seer born of the pot: “I take my
  leave to go to my own city; you ought to grant me permission.”
'7': >-
  “I am blessed; I have been favoured by the sight of the great-souled one. And
  I shall come again to behold you, for the sanctification of my own self.”
'8': >-
  When the Kakutstha spoke thus, the ascetic rich in austerity—whose vision was
  wondrous, and who was a guide in righteousness—spoke with supreme delight.
'9': >-
  “This utterance of yours, O Rāma, with auspicious syllables, is exceedingly
  marvellous. You yourself are the purifier of all beings, O delight of the
  Raghu line.”
'10': >-
  “Even for a single moment, O Rāma, whoever among men beholds you becomes
  purified, becomes as one destined for heaven, and becomes worthy of worship by
  all the gods.”
'11': >-
  “And those living beings on earth who look upon you with dreadful eyes—those
  are struck down by the rod of Yama and go at once to hell.”
'12': >-
  “Such are you, O best of the Raghus—purifying to all embodied beings. Even
  those who merely speak of you upon earth shall attain accomplishment, O
  Rāghava.”
'13': >-
  “Go, unharmed and untroubled, along a path free from fear on every side.
  Govern the kingdom in accordance with dharma, for you are the very refuge and
  course of the world.”
'14': >-
  Thus addressed by the muni, the king, with palms joined and with mind
  restrained, bowed in reverence to that wise sage abounding in holiness.
'15': >-
  Having saluted the best of sages and all those ascetics rich in austerity, he,
  unperturbed, mounted the Puṣpaka, adorned with gold.
'16': >-
  As he was departing, the companies of sages on every side honoured him with
  blessings, as the gods honour Indra, the thousand-eyed one, resplendent like
  the lord of the heavens.
'17': >-
  Rāma, seated at ease in that Puṣpaka decked with gold, appeared like the moon
  standing near a cloud at the coming of the rain-bearing season.
'18': >-
  Then, when half the day had passed, being honoured here and there along the
  way, the Kakutstha reached Ayodhyā and descended into the inner apartments.
'19': >-
  Thereupon, dismissing the splendid Puṣpaka that moved according to desire, the
  Lord sent it away, saying, “Go,” and also, “May welfare be yours.”
'20': >-
  Then Rāma spoke to the doorkeeper stationed within the inner precincts: “Go
  and quickly inform Lakṣmaṇa and Bharata—those two of swift prowess—of my
  arrival; do not delay.”
'21': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-second chapter, called “Rāma’s Return,” in the
  Uttarakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
