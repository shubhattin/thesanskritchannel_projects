  Now begins the seventy-fourth canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Nārada’s Speech.”
'1': >-
  Rāghava heard in full the pitiable lamentation of that twice-born (brāhmaṇa)—a
  wail wholly laden with misery and grief.
'2': >-
  Tormented by sorrow, he summoned those ministers—Vasiṣṭha and Vāmadeva, along
  with his brothers and the leaders of the townsmen (guilds and citizens).
'3': >-
  Then eight brāhmaṇas were ushered in together with Vasiṣṭha. They spoke
  thereafter to the king, who was radiant like a god, saying, “May you prosper.”
'4': >-
  Mārkaṇḍeya, Maudgalya, Vāmadeva, and Kāśyapa; Kātyāyana, Jābāli, Gautama, and
  likewise Nārada—these foremost among twice-born sages were all seated upon
  their respective seats.
'5': >-
  Having saluted the great seers who had arrived, with palms joined in
  reverence, he duly honoured also the ministers and the townsmen, each
  according to proper worth and with becoming courtesy.
'6': >-
  When all those blazing in spiritual splendour had taken their seats, Rāghava
  related everything: “This brāhmaṇa is afflicting me with his complaint.”
'7': >-
  Hearing those words of the king, who was downcast, Nārada replied to the
  monarch with auspicious speech, in the very presence of the sages.
'8': >-
  “Listen, O king: in due course the death of a child has occurred. Having heard
  what must be done, O king—do it, O delight of the Raghu line.”
'9': >-
  “In ancient times, in the Kṛta Yuga, O king, brāhmaṇas indeed were ascetics;
  and no non-brāhmaṇa at all, O king, practised asceticism in any manner.”
'10': >-
  “In that yuga—ablaze, established in Brahman, and unobscured—then all were
  free from untimely death and were long-sighted, possessing far-reaching
  vision.”
'11': >-
  “Thereafter arose the Tretā Yuga for embodied human beings. In it, kṣatriyas
  were born, endowed with full austerity.”
'12': >-
  “Through valour and through austerity they surpassed (others), by reason of
  merit from former births—those great-souled men who lived here in that Tretā
  Yuga.”
'13': >-
  “The entire brahmanical and kṣatriya potency—both what was earlier and what
  came later—was in both those yugas, possessed of equal vigour and power.”
'14': >-
  “Not perceiving among them any special superiority beyond that, they
  established there what was approved: the orderly system of the four varṇas.”
'15': >-
  “In that yuga—ablaze, founded upon dharma, and unobscured—adharma caused one
  foot to fall upon the surface of the earth.”
'16': >-
  “For when joined with adharma, spiritual lustre (tejas) indeed becomes
  diminished.”
'17': >-
  “The fleshly appetite (āmiṣa) and the strongly rājasic impurity belonging to
  the earlier times—this became what is called ‘untruth,’ and by one foot it
  stood upon the earth.”
'18': >-
  “When, through adharma, untruth had cast down one foot, there then
  manifested—formerly unknown—the fixed limit of lifespan (the curtailment of
  life).”
'19': >-
  “Yet when that untruth had fallen and adharma had descended upon the earth,
  the world still practised what was auspicious, devoted to truth and dharma.”
'20': >-
  “And in the Tretā Yuga those brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas that existed all
  performed austerities, while other people engaged in service and attendance
  upon them.”
'21': >-
  “That supreme dharma then came to be associated with the vaiśya and the śūdra
  as well; and the śūdras, in particular, rendered worship to all the varṇas.”
'22': >-
  “In the interval, with the presence of that adharma and that untruth, those
  earlier conditions declined greatly, O best of kings.”
'23': >-
  “Then adharma cast down a second foot; from that this yuga came to be known as
  Dvāpara.”
'24': >-
  “When that Dvāpara age was prevailing toward the close of the yuga, both
  adharma and untruth increased, O bull among men.”
'25': >-
  “In that age called Dvāpara, austerity entered among the vaiśyas. Thus, from
  the three yugas, austerity entered successively into the three varṇas (beyond
  the brāhmaṇas).”
'26': >-
  “From those three yugas, dharma too became fixed among the three varṇas; but a
  man who is not pure does not obtain dharma according to the yuga, O bull among
  men. Yet, O best of kings, one of deficient varṇa undertakes very great
  austerity.”
'27': >-
  “In the Kali Yuga to come, ascetic practice will occur in the śūdra womb
  (among those born as śūdras). O king, in Dvāpara, for one of śūdra birth,
  adharma is regarded as supreme (i.e., predominates).”
'28': >-
  “He, a great ascetic in thy realm’s borderland, O king, is today practising
  austerity with perverted understanding; because of him this killing (death) of
  the child has occurred.”
'29': >-
  “For whichever man, of wicked mind, commits adharma or any deed that ought not
  to be done within the territory of a king—whether in a town or at the very
  root of prosperity—he swiftly goes to hell; and that king too (is implicated),
  without doubt.”
'30': >-
  “Of study mastered, of austerity performed, and of righteous deeds
  accomplished, the king—protecting the subjects according to dharma—enjoys a
  sixth part as his share.”
'31': >-
  “If he does not protect the subjects, how can he be the enjoyer of that sixth
  share?”
'32': >-
  “Therefore, O tiger among men, search thine own realm. Wherever thou shouldst
  see evil-doing, there exert thy effort.”
'33': >-
  “Thus there will be increase of dharma and the lengthening of men’s lifespan,
  O best of men—and for this child too there will be life.”
'34': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-fourth canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “Nārada’s Speech.”
