  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninety-seventh sarga, called “The Praise of Bharata’s Virtues.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma soothed Lakṣmaṇa, the son of Sumitrā—who was greatly agitated and
  overcome by wrath—and spoke these words:
'2': >-
  “What need is there here of a bow, or of a sword, or of a shield, when
  Bharata—mighty in archery and of great wisdom—has himself come?”
'3': >-
  “Having pledged myself to uphold my father’s truth, if I were to slay Bharata
  who has come to me—what would I do with a kingdom that would be stained with
  reproach, O Lakṣmaṇa?”
'4': >-
  “That wealth which might come through the ruin of kinsmen or friends—I would
  not accept it, as one would not accept food made poisonous.”
'5': >-
  “Righteousness, prosperity, and pleasure—and even the earth itself, O
  Lakṣmaṇa—I desire for your sake. This I declare to you; listen well.”
'6': >-
  “For the keeping together of the brothers, and for happiness as well, O
  Lakṣmaṇa, I desire even the kingdom; but I would take up arms only in the
  cause of truth.”
'7': >-
  “This earth, encompassed by the ocean, is not hard for me to obtain, O gentle
  one; yet I would not desire even the sovereignty of Indra by unrighteous
  means, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'8': >-
  “Whatever happiness could be mine without Bharata, without you, and without
  Śatrughna as well, O giver of honor—let that be turned to ashes by fire.”
'9': >-
  “I deem that Bharata has come to Ayodhyā out of love for his brothers—dearer
  to me than my own life—remembering the duties of our lineage.”
'10': >-
  “Having heard that I have been exiled—wearing matted hair and bark
  garments—together with Jānakī, and with you too, O hero, best of men,”
'11': >-
  “his heart overwhelmed with affection and his senses confounded by grief,
  Bharata has come hither to see me—he has not come for any other reason.”
'12': >-
  “Angered with mother Kaikeyī, speaking harsh and unpleasant words, and having
  won over our father, that illustrious one has come to have the kingdom given
  back to me.”
'13': >-
  “Since the time has now come and he wishes to see us, Bharata would not, even
  in his mind, do anything displeasing toward us.”
'14': >-
  “When indeed, and in what way, has Bharata ever done you any harm before, that
  today you suspect him here and harbor such fear of him?”
'15': >-
  “Bharata must not be addressed by you with harsh speech, nor with words that
  are disagreeable; for I myself would be speaking what is disagreeable if I did
  so on the occasion of Bharata’s displeasure.”
'16': >-
  “How indeed would sons ever slay their father in any calamity? Or how would a
  brother slay a brother, O Saumitre? One would sooner give up one’s own life.”
'17': >-
  “If you utter this speech with the kingdom as your motive, then I shall say,
  upon seeing Bharata: ‘Let the kingdom be given to him.’”
'18': >-
  “Even when I speak to Bharata truly, ‘Let the kingdom be bestowed on you,’ O
  Lakṣmaṇa, he will surely reply only: ‘So be it’—and nothing else.”
'19': >-
  Thus addressed by his righteous brother—who was devoted to his
  welfare—Lakṣmaṇa, in shame, seemed to withdraw into himself, as it were.
'20': >-
  Hearing that statement, Lakṣmaṇa, abashed, replied: “I think it is your father
  Daśaratha himself who has come to see you.”
'21': >-
  Seeing Lakṣmaṇa ashamed, Rāghava answered: “I think this mighty-armed one has
  come here to see us.”
'22': >-
  “Or else I firmly think that, believing us accustomed to comfort, he has
  reflected on our forest-dwelling and will lead us back home.”
'23': >-
  “Or again, my illustrious father, Rāghava, will take this Vaidehī—who is used
  to the enjoyment of utmost happiness—away from the forest and depart.”
'24': >-
  “There appear those two, clearly seen—well-bred and lovely—swift as the speed
  of the wind, O hero: the finest of horses.”
'25': >-
  “There, at the head of the host, that very large-bodied elephant
  trembles—named Śatruñjaya—an aged one belonging to my wise father.”
'26': >-
  “But I do not see that pale white royal umbrella, honored by the world; it
  seems to me, O mighty-armed one, that there is some uncertainty here.”
'27': >-
  Instruction: “The first half-verse should be joined with the latter
  half-verse.”
'28': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, the conqueror in battle, descended from the summit of that śāla
  tree; and with joined palms he stood at Rāma’s side.
'29': >-
  And the army, having been instructed by Bharata that there should be no
  disorder, made its encampment all around that hill.
'30': >-
  That force—filled with elephants, horses, and chariots—took its place beside
  the mountain, spreading out for a distance of one and a half yojanas in width.
'31': >-
  Thus, on Citrakūṭa, Bharata’s army—placing righteousness foremost and casting
  off pride—shines, led by one who knows policy, for the purpose of winning the
  favor of the delight of the Raghu line.
'32': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-seventh sarga, called “The Praise of Bharata’s Virtues,”
  in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic.
