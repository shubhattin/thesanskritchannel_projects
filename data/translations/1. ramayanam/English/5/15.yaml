  Now, in the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa, the fifteenth sarga,
  called “The Finding of Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Remaining there, he kept looking about and seeking Maithilī; and, surveying
  the whole ground in every direction, he examined all that region.
'2': >-
  It was beautified by trees with spreading, continuous creepers; endowed with
  divine fragrance and sweetness of sap, and ornamented on every side.
'3': >-
  That grove, resembling Nandana itself, filled with deer and birds, crowded
  with mansions and lofty palaces, and resounding with the calls of cuckoos in
  multitude—
'4': >-
  Adorned with tanks graced by golden lotuses and water-lilies; furnished with
  many seats and carpets; and abounding in houses of many storeys—
'5': >-
  Delightful with lovely flowers of every season, and with trees laden with
  fruit; rich with the splendour of blossoming aśokas, like the radiance of the
  sun at its rising—
'6': >-
  Standing there, Māruti beheld it as though it were aflame, the leafless
  branches seeming again and again to be made so by the birds darting forth.
'7': >-
  For hundreds of variegated birds, with garlands of flowers upon their heads,
  flew out; and the aśokas—destroyers of sorrow—were as though fashioned from
  flowers with their very roots.
'8': >-
  Weighted down by an excessive burden of blossoms, they seemed as though they
  touched the earth—those karnikāras in bloom and those kiṃśukas richly
  flowered.
'9': >-
  By the lustre of those trees, the whole place appeared on every side as though
  illumined: puṃnāgas, saptaparṇas, champakas, and uddālakas as well—
'10': >-
  Many of them, with roots grown strong, shone forth in full blossom—some like
  refined gold, others with the radiance of a flame’s crest.
'11': >-
  Some aśokas there, by the thousand, were like dark blue collyrium; it was like
  Nandana, the wondrous garden of the Devas, like the variegated Chaitraratha
  itself.
'12': >-
  It seemed inconceivably vast, divine, and endowed with lovely splendour—like a
  second firmament filled with clusters of flower-like lights.
'13': >-
  Variegated with hundreds of flower-gems, like a fifth ocean; densely strewn
  with flowers of every season and with trees fragrant with honeyed scent—
'14': >-
  That delightful garden, filled with diverse sounds of herds of deer and flocks
  of birds, bore streams of many fragrances—holy in scent and charming to the
  mind.
'15': >-
  Like a lordly mountain rich in perfumes, like a second Gandhamādana—such was
  that Aśoka-grove; and there the foremost of monkeys—
'16': >-
  He saw, not far away, a mighty shrine-palace, standing amidst a thousand
  pillars, pale-white like Kailāsa.
'17': >-
  With steps fashioned of coral and a platform of heated gold, it seemed to
  steal the eyes away, as though shining with prosperity itself.
'18': >-
  Spotless, and because of its loftiness seeming to scratch the very sky—then he
  beheld her, clothed in soiled garments, surrounded by rākṣasīs.
'19': >-
  Worn thin by fasting, wretched, sighing again and again—he saw her like the
  pure streak of the moon at the beginning of the bright fortnight.
'20': >-
  Her lovely radiance was dimly manifest through her form, like the flame of
  fire shrouded in a net of smoke.
'21': >-
  Covered with a single yellow cloth, worn and of the best kind; with her fire
  of beauty, as it were, unadorned, like a lotus-pond without lotuses, sullied
  with mud.
'22': >-
  Afflicted, scorched by sorrow, wasted away, living as an ascetic—like Rohiṇī
  tormented by the planet Aṅgāraka (Mars).
'23': >-
  Her face filled with tears, wretched, emaciated by abstinence; given over to
  brooding on grief, ever miserable, ever devoted to suffering—
'24': >-
  Seeing not her beloved people, but seeing only the troop of rākṣasīs—like a
  doe deprived of her own herd and surrounded by a pack of dogs.
'25': >-
  With a single braid dark as a blue serpent hanging down upon her hip—like the
  earth clothed in a dark forest-tract when the rain-clouds have passed away.
'26': >-
  Worthy of happiness yet tormented by misery, unskilled in calamities—seeing
  that large-eyed lady exceedingly soiled and emaciated—
'27': >-
  He reasoned, “This is Sītā,” establishing it by convincing causes—she who had
  then been carried away by that rākṣasa of assumed forms.
'28': >-
  For as she had been described and seen, so was this woman—fair-browed, with
  the full moon for her face, and with lovely rounded breasts.
'29': >-
  By her radiance making all the quarters free of darkness, as though she were a
  goddess—dark-throated, with lips like the bimba fruit, slender-waisted, of
  perfect bearing—
'30': >-
  Sītā, lotus-leaf-eyed, like Manmatha’s own delight; beloved of all the world,
  like the splendour of the full moon.
'31': >-
  Seated on the ground, slender-bodied, like an ascetic fixed in vows; breathing
  heavily, timid, like the consort of the king of serpents.
'32': >-
  Not shining because of a vast net of grief spread over her—like a flame of
  fire caught in a web of smoke.
'33': >-
  Like memory grown doubtful, like prosperity fallen; like faith struck down,
  like hope thwarted—
'34': >-
  Like success beset with obstacles, like understanding clouded with impurity;
  like fame cast down by an unfounded slander—
'35': >-
  Pained by separation from Rāma, oppressed by the hosts of rākṣasas; helpless,
  with eyes like a fawn, glancing this way and that—
'36': >-
  With tears filling her face, her eyelashes and eyes darkened; with an
  uncheerful countenance, sighing again and again—
'37': >-
  Bearing grime and mud, wretched—though worthy of adornment, yet unadorned;
  like the radiance of the lord of stars (the moon) covered by dark clouds.
'38': >-
  Beholding Sītā thus, his understanding was set ablaze—like learning loosened
  and slipping away when one fails to keep to the traditional instruction.
'39': >-
  With difficulty Hanumān recognized that unadorned Sītā—like speech that,
  lacking proper refinement, has strayed into another meaning.
'40': >-
  Looking upon that large-eyed, blameless princess, he again reasoned, “This is
  Sītā,” confirming it by well-grounded causes.
'41': >-
  The ornaments that Rāma had formerly described as being upon the limbs of
  Vaidehī—those nets of ornaments adorning her body—he perceived.
'42': >-
  The well-made ear-ornaments and the well-set ‘dog-tooth’ ornaments; and the
  bracelets upon her hands, inlaid with gems and coral—
'43': >-
  Darkened by long wearing, yet retaining their proper shape—“These very ones, I
  believe, are those that Rāma described.”
'44': >-
  Those that had been cast off, I do not see here; those that were not cast off
  by her—these are they, without doubt.
'45': >-
  And that auspicious upper garment, yellow like gold-leaf, fallen and clinging
  to the trees, was then seen by the monkeys.
'46': >-
  And the chief ornaments, cast down upon the surface of the earth—these too
  were seen: great and resonant, cast away by none other than she.
'47': >-
  This garment, long worn, is now more worn and distressed; yet its colour is
  not diminished, and its lustre is still as before.
'48': >-
  This is she—golden-limbed Vaidehī—Rāma’s beloved queen; though lost, she does
  not perish from his mind.
'49': >-
  This is she, for whose sake Rāma here is consumed in four ways: by compassion,
  by gentleness, by grief, and by love.
'50': >-
  ‘A woman is lost’—thus by compassion; ‘she has sought refuge’—thus by his
  gentleness; ‘my wife is lost’—thus by grief; ‘my beloved’—thus by love.
'51': >-
  As is the beauty and excellence of each limb and every part of this noble
  lady, so is Rāma’s own nature—therefore she is his, that dark-eyed one.
'52': >-
  Her mind is established in him, and his mind is established in her; by that
  mutual devotion both she and that righteous-souled lord live even for a
  moment.
'53': >-
  Hard indeed is what Rāma has done, bereft of her, though a mighty lord—that he
  sustains his own body and does not sink down under grief.
'54': >-
  Thus, seeing Sītā in that condition, the son of the Wind was filled with joy;
  in his heart he went to Rāma, and he praised that lord.
'55': >-
  Thus ends the fifteenth sarga, called “The Finding of Sītā,” in Sundara-kāṇḍa
  of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
