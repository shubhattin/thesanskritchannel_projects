  “Revered Sir, because I am wounded, and because shame agitates my senses, I am
  exhausted and am not able to speak these words properly.
'3': >-
  “Jatāyu and I, both deluded by pride through rivalry, leapt into the sky from
  afar, desiring to test and ascertain our prowess.
'4': >-
  “Upon the summit of Kailāsa we made a wager in the presence of the sages: ‘The
  Sun is to be followed until he sets behind the great mountain.’
'5': >-
  “It so happened that, as we both advanced together, we beheld upon the face of
  the earth cities, each separate from the other, the measure of chariot-wheels

  “Swiftly springing up into the sky and taking our station in the path of the
  Sun, we gazed down upon that forest carpeted with green grass.

  “The earth appeared covered with rocky masses, as though strewn with stones;
  and the world was encircled by rivers, as though the earth were girdled with
  threads.

  “I suspect that Jatāyu fell in Janasthāna; but I fell upon Vindhya—my wings
  burnt, and I became benumbed and helpless.
'17': >-
  “Deprived of my kingdom and of my brother, and bereft of my wings and valour
  as well—wishing only to die in every way—I shall cast myself from the
  mountain-peak.”
'18': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-first sarga in the Kishkindhā Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, named “The Account of Following the Sun.”
