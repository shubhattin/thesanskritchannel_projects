  Now begins the seventy-first canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Praise of Śatrughna.”
'1': >-
  Then, in the twelfth year, Śatrughna—attended by only a small force of
  servants and troops—desired to go to Ayodhyā, which was protected and ruled by
  Rāma.
'2': >-
  Thereupon, having sent back the foremost of the ministers and the principal
  leaders of the army, he proceeded, accompanied by excellent horses and by a
  hundred chariots.
'3': >-
  Having travelled through seven or eight measured stages of halting-places,
  that delight of the Raghus, the greatly renowned prince, came to Vālmīki’s
  hermitage and took up his abode there.
'4': >-
  Then that bull among men bowed at the feet of Vālmīki, and received from the
  sage’s own hands the water for washing the feet, the offering of respect
  (arghya), and the rites of hospitality due to a guest.
'5': >-
  There the sage related to great-souled Śatrughna thousands of narratives—many
  in form and exceedingly sweet in their telling.
'6': >-
  And the sage spoke words concerning the slaying of Lavaṇa: “A deed most
  difficult to accomplish has been done by you in killing Lavaṇa.”
'7': >-
  “Many kings, gentle one—mighty-armed hero—endowed with great strength, were
  slain by Lavaṇa, together with their armies and their conveyances, even as
  they fought.”
'8': >-
  “But you have slain that wicked one with ease, O best of men; and by your
  prowess the terror that afflicted the world there has been brought to peace.”
'9': >-
  “The dreadful slaying of Rāvaṇa was accomplished only by immense effort; but
  this exceedingly great deed has been achieved by you without exertion.”
'10': >-
  “In Lavaṇa being slain, the gods have conceived supreme joy; and for all
  beings as well, and for the whole world, you have done what is dear and
  beneficial.”
'11': >-
  “That battle too I beheld exactly as it happened, O best of men—O Rāghava—when
  I was seated in the assembly hall of Vāsava (Indra).”
'12': >-
  “In my heart also, Śatrughna, there abides the highest gladness. I shall smell
  your head (kiss the crown of your head); this is the utmost expression of
  affection.”
'13': >-
  Having spoken thus, the great sage inhaled the fragrance of Śatrughna’s head,
  and extended hospitality to him and to those who had followed in his train.
'14': >-
  That best of men partook of the meal, and heard the supremely sweet melody; at
  that time he listened, in due sequence, to the history of Rāma’s deeds.
'15': >-
  He listened then to the anciently composed Rāma-carita—accompanied by the
  modes and measures of the lute, furnished with the three registers and their
  proper articulations, refined and well-arranged, endowed with the marks of
  excellence, and perfectly set in even time and rhythm.
'16': >-
  Hearing those syllables—true and faithful, recounting events exactly as they
  had occurred before—Śatrughna, that tiger among men, became senseless, his
  eyes overflowing with tears.
'17': >-
  For what seemed like a moment, he remained bereft of consciousness; again and
  again he drew deep sighs, and in that song he heard the past events as though
  they were happening in the present.
'18': >-
  And the king’s attendants, hearing that excellence of song, became downcast
  and sorrowful; with faces lowered they kept saying, “This is a marvel!”
'19': >-
  The soldiers there also spoke among themselves: “What is this, and where are
  we? Is this a vision seen in a dream?”
'20': >-
  “That very account which we formerly beheld—here again, at the very seat of
  the hermitage we hear it. What is this? Is it a dream? Or could this be a
  wondrous composition of song that brings prosperity?”
'21': >-
  Having reached the height of astonishment, they spoke thus to Śatrughna: “Well
  then, O best of men—question Vālmīki, the foremost of sages.”
'22': >-
  But Śatrughna said to them all, who were filled with curiosity: “O soldiers,
  it is not fitting for us to question in such a manner here.”
'23': >-
  “Many wondrous things indeed occur in this sage’s hermitage; yet it is not
  proper, driven by mere curiosity, to inquire into the great sage.”
'24': >-
  Having spoken thus to the soldiers, that delight of the Raghus bowed to the
  great seer and then, at that time, went to his own lodging.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-first canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, called “The Praise of Śatrughna.”
