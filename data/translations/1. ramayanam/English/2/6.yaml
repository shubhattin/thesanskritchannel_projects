  Now begins the sixth sarga, named “Paurotsuka” (The Joy of the Citizens), in
  the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  When the family priest had departed, Rāma—having bathed and with his mind
  restrained and disciplined—approached Nārāyaṇa together with his large-eyed
  consort.
'2': >-
  Then, taking in his hand with reverence the vessel containing the oblation,
  and according to the prescribed rite, he offered the sacrifice due to the
  great Deity into the blazing fire.
'3': >-
  Having partaken of the remainder of that oblation, and having sought for
  himself what was dear and auspicious, he meditated upon the god Nārāyaṇa while
  seated upon a well-spread bed of kuśa grass.
'4': >-
  Observing silence, and with Vaidehī beside him, his mind firmly controlled,
  the son of the best of men lay down to rest in the splendid sanctuary of
  Viṣṇu.
'5': >-
  When only one watch of the night remained, he awoke, and had the proper
  arrangements for adornment and dressing made thoroughly within the palace.
'6': >-
  There, hearing the pleasant words of charioteers, bards, and panegyrists, he
  performed the worship of the morning twilight, and, well-composed, recited his
  sacred prayers.
'7': >-
  Having bowed down, he hymned Madhusūdana with his head bent in reverence; clad
  in spotless linen, he had the Brāhmaṇas recite the auspicious texts.
'8': >-
  Then the proclamation of “pūṇyāha” (“Let this day be holy and blessed”), deep
  and sweet in sound, resounded through Ayodhyā, accompanied by the
  reverberation of musical instruments.
'9': >-
  Hearing at that time that Rāghava, together with Vaidehī, had completed his
  fast, all the people dwelling in Ayodhyā were filled with delight.
'10': >-
  Thereupon, all the townsfolk, having heard of Rāma’s consecration, and seeing
  that the night had ended and dawn had come, set about adorning the city.
'11': >-
  On temples with peaks like white clouds, and upon the shrines of the gods; at
  crossroads and along the great streets; at sanctuaries and on the lofty
  battlements—everywhere they set decorations in place.
'12': >-
  In markets rich with many kinds of merchandise, in the shops of merchants, and
  in the prosperous and splendid houses of householders as well, the city’s
  embellishment was undertaken.
'13': >-
  In all the assembly-halls too, and by the trees marked and set apart for
  festivity, fine standards were raised high, and banners and pennants were
  displayed.
'14': >-
  Then the people heard voices that delighted both mind and ear—the songs of
  singers, and the music of troupes of actors and dancers as they performed.
'15': >-
  In the squares and in the houses, people conversed among themselves with talk
  wholly concerned with Rāma’s consecration, for the time of Rāma’s anointing
  had arrived.
'16': >-
  Even children, playing in groups at the doorways of their homes, spoke among
  themselves stories connected with Rāma’s consecration.
'17': >-
  With offerings of flowers prepared and the air perfumed with the fragrance of
  incense, the royal highway was made splendid by the citizens for Rāma’s
  consecration.
'18': >-
  And for the sake of illumination—lest night should fall unexpectedly—they set
  up rows of lamp-trees (stands of lamps) everywhere along the by-streets.
'19': >-
  Thus, having adorned the city, its inhabitants—longing for Rāma’s consecration
  as heir-apparent—waited in eager expectation.
'20': >-
  Gathering together in groups in the squares and in the assembly-halls, they
  talked among themselves there and praised the lord of men.
'21': >-
  “Ah! This king, the great-souled delight of the Ikṣvāku line—knowing his own
  self to have grown old—will consecrate Rāma to the kingdom!”
'22': >-
  “Indeed we are all favored, since Rāma will for long be our protector as
  king—Rāma, who has seen and understood both the near and the far, the higher
  and the lower worlds.”
'23': >-
  “Humble in spirit, learned, righteous-souled, and devoted to his
  brothers—Rāghava is as affectionate toward us as he is tenderly attached to
  his own brothers.”
'24': >-
  “Long may the righteous-souled, sinless king Daśaratha live—by whose grace we
  shall behold Rāma consecrated!”
'25': >-
  While the citizens spoke in such ways, others heard them—countryfolk, whose
  tidings had become renowned in all directions, arriving from the regions round
  about.
'26': >-
  Those people of the countryside, coming to the city from every quarter to see
  Rāma’s consecration, filled Ayodhyā as they arrived.
'27': >-
  As those multitudes spread everywhere in surging streams, a great roar was
  heard there—like the roar of the ocean when its force is heightened at the
  time of the full moon.
'28': >-
  Then that city, like Indra’s city in splendor, thronged on every side with
  countryfolk eager to behold it, became noisy and crowded all around—like the
  waters of the sea teeming with ocean-creatures.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the sixth sarga, named “Paurotsuka,” in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the
  holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
