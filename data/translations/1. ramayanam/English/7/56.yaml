  Now begins the fifty-sixth canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Attainment of the Status of Maitrāvaruṇa (Mitra and
  Varuṇa).”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words spoken by Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, the slayer of heroes among the
  foe, with joined palms addressed that resplendent Rāghava with these words.
'2': >-
  “O scion of Kakutstha, how did those two—king and brāhmaṇa, both twice-born
  and approved by the gods—having cast off their bodies, again attain union with
  a body?”
'3': >-
  Thus addressed by Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma, the great-souled delight of the
  Ikṣvākus—best of men and of mighty splendour—replied to Lakṣmaṇa.
'4': >-
  “By a mutual curse, those righteous ones abandoned their bodies; the royal
  sage and the brāhmaṇa sage became like the wind—bodiless ascetics rich in
  austerity.”
'5': >-
  “Vasiṣṭha, the great sage of exceeding brilliance, though without a body and
  for the sake of obtaining another body, went into the presence of the
  Grandsire (Brahmā).”
'6': >-
  “Having bowed at the feet of that knower of Dharma, the god of gods, he then
  spoke to Pitāmaha (Brahmā) these words, being in the state of wind
  (bodiless).”
'7': >-
  “O Blessed Lord, through Nimi’s curse I have come to bodilessness. O Lord of
  the worlds, O great deity—thou too, though born from an egg, and thou too,
  though born from the lotus—(art witness to the power of destiny).”
'8': >-
  “For all who are without bodies, great sorrow will arise. Indeed, O Lord, all
  actions come to naught for one who is devoid of a body. Be pleased, therefore,
  to grant me the favour of obtaining another body.”
'9': >-
  Then Brahmā, the Self-born, of immeasurable radiance, said to him: “O greatly
  renowned one, enter into the splendour that is born of Mitra and Varuṇa.”
'10': >-
  “Even there, O best of twice-born, thou shalt be non-womb-born (ayoni-ja).
  Endowed with great righteousness, thou shalt again return to my dominion.”
'11': >-
  Thus addressed by the deity, he bowed to Pitāmaha, circled him reverently, and
  swiftly departed for Varuṇa’s abode.
'12': >-
  At that very time Mitra too assumed the office of Varuṇa—accompanied by the
  Milk-Ocean and worshipped by the foremost of the gods.
'13': >-
  At that same time Urvaśī, the supreme of apsarases, happened to come to that
  place, surrounded by her companions.
'14': >-
  Seeing her—of perfect beauty—sporting in Varuṇa’s abode, a great delight
  entered Varuṇa on account of Urvaśī.
'15': >-
  That Varuṇa chose for union the foremost of apsarases—Urvaśī—whose eyes were
  like lotus petals and whose face was like the full moon.
'16': >-
  Then she, standing with joined palms, replied to Varuṇa: “O lord of the gods,
  I have already been chosen earlier by Mitra himself, directly.”
'17': >-
  But Varuṇa, afflicted by the shafts of Kāma, spoke these words: “I shall
  discharge this potency into this pitcher fashioned by the gods.”
'18': >-
  “Having thus released it, O fair-hipped one, O lady of exquisite complexion, I
  shall have my desire fulfilled even if thou dost not wish for union.”
'19': >-
  Hearing that well-spoken utterance of Varuṇa, the guardian of the world,
  Urvaśī—exceedingly pleased—spoke these words.
'20': >-
  “Let it be so; my heart indeed rests in thee, and my affection for thee is
  even greater; yet, O Lord, my body belongs to Mitra.”
'21': >-
  Thus addressed by Urvaśī, Varuṇa cast into that pitcher his wondrous, mighty
  seed—blazing like the cresting flame of fire.
'22': >-
  Then Urvaśī went to the place where the deity Mitra was. Approaching her
  closely, Mitra said this to Urvaśī:
'23': >-
  “I had invited thee earlier; why then wast thou cast off (by me)? Having
  chosen another as husband, therefore thou art of wicked conduct.”
'24': >-
  “Stained by my wrath because of this misdeed, thou shalt dwell in the world of
  men for some time.”
'25': >-
  “Purūravas, the royal sage, king of Kāśī, the son of Budha—go to him today, O
  foolish-minded one; he shall be thy husband.”
'26': >-
  Then she, by the fault of that curse, went to Purūravas—indeed to Purūravas,
  the true-born son of Budha—having repaired to him.
'27': >-
  From him was born the illustrious and mighty son Āyu, whose son was Nahusha,
  radiant like Indra.
'28': >-
  When the lord of the three heavens had strayed after hurling the thunderbolt
  at Vṛtra, it was he (Nahusha) who administered Indra’s sovereignty for a
  hundred thousand years.
'29': >-
  Thus, by that curse, Urvaśī—fair-eyed, of beautiful teeth, and
  lovely-browed—went down to the earth and dwelt there for many years; and when
  the curse was exhausted, she went to Indra’s assembly (heaven) as well.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-sixth canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the holy, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Attainment of the Status of
  Maitrāvaruṇa (Mitra and Varuṇa).”
