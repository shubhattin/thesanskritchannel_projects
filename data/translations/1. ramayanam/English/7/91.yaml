  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninety-first canto, entitled “The Arrangements for the Sacrifice (Yajña).”
'1': >-
  Having related this, Kakutstha (Rāma), of immeasurable splendour, again spoke
  to Lakṣmaṇa these words, consonant with dharma.
'2': >-
  “Vasiṣṭha and Vāmadeva, and Jābāli, and likewise Kaśyapa, and all the foremost
  twice-born—pre-eminent Brāhmaṇas—versed in, and officiating for, the
  Aśvamedha—”
'3': >-
  “Bring all those together, O Lakṣmaṇa; and having taken counsel with them,
  with due composure I shall set free the horse endowed with auspicious marks.”
'4': >-
  Hearing this speech spoken by Rāghava, Lakṣmaṇa—swift in prowess—summoned all
  the twice-born and caused them to have audience of Rāghava.
'5': >-
  Beholding Rāghava, godlike in radiance, and having performed obeisance at his
  feet, those sages honoured that invincible hero with blessings.
'6': >-
  Then Rāghava, that great and renowned one, with joined palms, declared to the
  best of the twice-born his intention regarding the Aśvamedha.
'7': >-
  Hearing that from Rāma, all those twice-born, having bowed in reverence to the
  Bull-bannered Lord (Śiva), approved and celebrated the Aśvamedha in every way.
'8': >-
  Hearing the wondrous utterance of those foremost Brāhmaṇas concerning the
  Aśvamedha, Rāma became exceedingly pleased at that time.
'9': >-
  Having understood their resolve and the ritual undertaking, Rāma said to
  Lakṣmaṇa: “Dispatch messengers swiftly to the great-souled Sugrīva.”
'10': >-
  “‘Come, together with great hosts of Vānaras—many forest-dwellers—may
  auspiciousness attend you; come to partake in this grand festival.’”
'11': >-
  “And let Vibhīṣaṇa also come—he of incomparable valour—surrounded by many
  Rākṣasas who can move at will, for this great Aśvamedha sacrifice.”
'12': >-
  “And let those fortunate kings who wish to do what is dear to me come quickly
  with their attendants, to behold this unsurpassed sacrifice.”
'13': >-
  “And all the twice-born, established in dharma, who have gone to other
  lands—invite every one of them to the Aśvamedha, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'14': >-
  “And the sages, rich in austerities, O mighty-armed one, are to be
  summoned—every order of twice-born from distant lands, together with their
  wives; and likewise those who live by their skill in beating time and keeping
  rhythm, and likewise actors and dancers.”
'15': >-
  “And a very great sacrificial enclosure is to be commanded to be prepared in
  the Naimiṣa forest, abounding in cattle, O mighty-armed one; for that place is
  supremely holy.”
'16': >-
  “And rites of pacification (śānti-karmas) too, O mighty-armed one, are to be
  set in motion on every side.”
'17': >-
  “And by hundreds, O knower of dharma, let men experience that chief and
  unsurpassed rite—the great sacrifice—there in Naimiṣa, O delight of the Raghu
  line.”
'18': >-
  “Thus satisfied and well-nourished, and honoured in due manner, everyone, O
  knower of dharma, will attain gladness; therefore let the people be invited
  without delay.”
'19': >-
  “A hundred cartloads of fine rice, and ten thousand (measures) of sesame and
  green gram—let these go forth in advance, O mighty one.”
'20': >-
  “Chickpeas and horse-gram, black-gram and salt; and in proportion to these,
  ghee (or unctuous substances), and fragrances; and everything else as well, in
  due measure and in compact supply.”
'21': >-
  “Let abundant crores of gold, and more than a hundred measures of silver, be
  sent ahead; and having put Bharata at the fore, let him proceed onward with
  due composure.”
'22': >-
  “Along the way, let there be market-streets, and all manner of actors and
  dancers; cooks, and many women ever in the bloom of youth.”
'23': >-
  “And together with Bharata, let the armies proceed in front; and the townsmen,
  increased in strength and resources, and Brāhmaṇas well, well-recollected and
  disciplined.”
'24': >-
  “And artisans attached to works, carpenters, treasurers, and merchants; and
  all my mothers (the queen-mothers), and the inner apartments of the princes as
  well.”
'25': >-
  “And my golden-hued consort (Sītā), and those skilled in the consecration
  (dīkṣā) and in the rites—placing Bharata in front, let that greatly renowned
  one go on ahead.”
'26': >-
  Thus did the best of men, of great strength, issue commands regarding the
  honourable services and offerings to be rendered to mighty kings along with
  their attendants.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-first canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Arrangements for the Sacrifice
  (Yajña).”
