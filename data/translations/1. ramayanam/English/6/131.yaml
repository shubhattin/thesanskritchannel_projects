'0': >-
  Now begins, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-thirty-first canto, called “The Coronation of Śrī Rāma.”
'1': >-
  Then Bharata—he who had increased Kaikeyī’s joy—placing his joined palms upon
  his head in reverence, spoke to his elder brother Rāma, whose prowess was ever
  true to righteousness.
'2': >-
  “My own mother has been honored, and this kingship has been bestowed on me.
  That very sovereignty I now give back to you again, in the same manner as you
  once gave it to me.”
'3': >-
  “A burden has been laid upon me alone—like a heavy yoke set on a young bull by
  one far stronger. I do not dare to bear so weighty a load, as a mere youth
  cannot carry a great burden.”
'4': >-
  “Like a dam broken by a mighty rush of water and leaking away, I deem this
  kingdom a thing hard to hold—full of breaches and without protection.”
'5': >-
  “As a donkey cannot match the pace of a horse, or a crow that of a swan, so I
  do not have the strength to follow your path, O hero, O subduer of foes.”
'6': >-
  “As a tree is planted and grows within an enclosure—though great, with a
  mighty trunk and many branches—it is yet difficult to climb,”
'7': >-
  “and having flowered, it may wither without showing fruit; then the one for
  whose sake it was planted would not obtain the intended benefit.”
'8': >-
  “This, O mighty-armed one, is the comparison; you ought to understand its
  purport. If you, O lord among men, do not rule over us—your dependents and
  servants—then truly…”
'9': >-
  “Let the world today behold you, O Rāghava, now consecrated—like the sun
  blazing at midday, radiant with intense splendor.”
'10': >-
  “Awake and even sleep amid the sweet sounds of songs, the tumultuous roar of
  assembled instruments, and the jingling of girdles and anklets.”
'11': >-
  “So long as the wheel of time turns, and so long as this earth endures, so
  long here exercise sovereignty over this world.”
'12': >-
  Hearing Bharata’s words, Rāma—vanquisher of hostile cities—accepted them,
  saying, “So be it,” and sat down upon the auspicious seat.
'13': >-
  Then, at Śatrughna’s direction, skilled barbers—able of hand and very
  swift—surrounded Rāghava.
'14': >-
  But first, when Bharata had bathed, and Lakṣmaṇa of great strength, and
  Sugrīva the lord of the Vānaras, and Vibhīṣaṇa the lord of the Rākṣasas,
'15': >-
  Rāma, his matted locks cleansed away, having bathed, adorned with wondrous
  garlands and unguents, and clad in most precious garments, stood there shining
  with splendor.
'16': >-
  That valorous increaser of the Ikṣvāku line then caused the requisite rites
  and preparations to be performed for Rāma, and likewise for Lakṣmaṇa.
'17': >-
  And for Sītā, all the wives of Daśaratha—high-minded women—performed with
  their own hands, at that time, the fitting and delightful preparations.
'18': >-
  Thereafter Kauśalyā, rejoicing and affectionate to her son, carefully
  performed the auspicious adornment for all the wives of the Vānaras.
'19': >-
  Then, at Śatrughna’s word, Sumantra the charioteer, having yoked it, brought
  forth a chariot beautiful in all its parts.
'20': >-
  Seeing the divine chariot standing—resplendent like fire, the sun, and a
  lotus—Rāma, mighty-armed and conqueror of hostile cities, mounted it.
'21': >-
  Sugrīva and Hanumān too—radiant like Mahendra—having bathed, wearing
  divine-like garments, and adorned with auspicious earrings, set forth.
'22': >-
  Adorned with every ornament, Sugrīva’s wives and Sītā too—wearing auspicious
  earrings—went forth, eager to behold the city.
'23': >-
  In Ayodhyā, the ministers of King Daśaratha, placing the royal priest at their
  head, deliberated with due concern for the matter.
'24': >-
  Aśoka, Vijaya, and Siddhārtha—composed and attentive—took counsel for the
  prosperity of Rāma and for the flourishing of the city.
'25': >-
  “All that is proper to do for the consecration of Rāma—the great-souled one
  worthy of victory—whatever auspicious rite should be done, do all of it.”
'26': >-
  Thus, having dispatched all those ministers, the royal priest too; and then
  they swiftly went out of the city, intent on seeing Rāma.
'27': >-
  Rāma, sinless, mounted a chariot yoked with steeds, and proceeded—like Indra
  of a thousand eyes—to that excellent city.
'28': >-
  Bharata took hold of the reins; Śatrughna held the royal parasol; and
  Lakṣmaṇa, fanning above his head, waved the chowrie.
'29': >-
  Standing near on every side, Vibhīṣaṇa, lord of the Rākṣasas, took another
  chowrie—white and moon-bright.
'30': >-
  As Rāma was being praised, then in the sky by companies of ṛṣis and by the
  gods with their Marut hosts, a sweet sound was heard.
'31': >-
  Then Sugrīva, the great-splendored bull among the Vānaras, mounted an elephant
  named Śatruñjaya, huge as a mountain.
'32': >-
  Vānaras, adorned with all ornaments and assuming human forms, rode upon nine
  thousand elephants.
'33': >-
  With the blare of conch-sounds and the booming resonance of kettle-drums, that
  tiger among men proceeded to that city, garlanded with mansions.
'34': >-
  They beheld Rāghava approaching with his foremost attendants, shining in
  beauty then, upon that chariot—preeminent among charioteers.
'35': >-
  Honoring the son of Kakutstha, and being welcomed by Rāma, they followed the
  great-souled one, surrounded by his brothers.
'36': >-
  Encircled by ministers, brāhmaṇas, and the citizens, Rāma shone with splendor
  like the moon amid the stars.
'37': >-
  He went forth surrounded by joyous men, proclaiming auspicious blessings,
  bearing cymbals and svastika-emblems in their hands, with musical instruments
  leading the way.
'38': >-
  Unbroken grains, gold, cows, maidens along with brāhmaṇas, and men holding
  sweetmeats in their hands—all went before Rāma.
'39': >-
  Then Rāma spoke to the ministers of his friendship with Sugrīva, the prowess
  of the Wind-god’s son, and the deeds performed by the Vānaras.
'40': >-
  Hearing it, the inhabitants of Ayodhyā were filled with amazement—at the deeds
  of the Vānaras and the might of the Rākṣasas; and he also told the ministers
  of his alliance with Vibhīṣaṇa.
'41': >-
  Having thus related these matters, Rāma—radiant and accompanied by the
  Vānaras—entered Ayodhyā, filled with delighted and well-nourished people.
'42': >-
  Then the townspeople raised high banners at every house, and he reached his
  father’s delightful palace—the fair abode of the Ikṣvākus.
'43': >-
  Thereupon the prince, the delight of the Raghu line, spoke sweetly to Bharata,
  the best among the righteous, with words weighed by purpose.
'44': >-
  “Having reached the palace of the great-souled father, and having entered it,
  and having saluted Kauśalyā, Sumitrā, and Kaikeyī,”
'45': >-
  “my own foremost mansion too—great, with an Aśoka grove, strewn with pearls
  and vaidūrya gems—present that to Sugrīva.”
'46': >-
  Hearing his words, Bharata of truthful valor took Sugrīva by the hand and
  entered that residence.
'47': >-
  Then, urged by Śatrughna, they quickly entered, taking lamps with oil,
  couches, and coverings.
'48': >-
  And Rāma’s younger brother, of great splendor, said to Sugrīva: “O lord,
  command messengers for Rāma’s consecration.”
'49': >-
  Sugrīva quickly gave four golden vessels for the four chiefs of the Vānaras,
  all adorned with every jewel.
'50': >-
  “And at the time of dawn, with jars filled with the waters of the four oceans,
  wait here; do so, O Vānaras.”
'51': >-
  Thus addressed, those great-souled Vānaras, like mighty elephants, sprang
  swiftly into the sky, like fast-moving Garuḍas.
'52': >-
  Jāmbavān, Hanumān, the Vānara named Vegadarśī, and also Ṛṣabha brought forth
  pitchers filled to the brim.
'53': >-
  They carried water in jars from five hundred rivers; and then they brought a
  jar filled with water from the eastern ocean.
'54': >-
  Suṣeṇa, endowed with strength and adorned with all jewels, and Ṛṣabha swiftly
  brought water from the southern ocean.
'55': >-
  Gavaya fetched water from the western great ocean in a golden vessel covered
  with red sandal and camphor.
'56': >-
  Marutavikrama, with a great jewel-vessel, swiftly brought cool water from the
  northern ocean—his speed like that of Garuḍa and the wind.
'57': >-
  Thus did Anila—righteous-souled and endowed with every excellence—bring it.
  Then the best of the Vānaras, seeing that water brought,
'58': >-
  Śatrughna, together with the ministers, presented it to the foremost royal
  priest and also to the well-wishers, for Rāma’s consecration.
'59': >-
  Then Vasiṣṭha, self-controlled and aged, along with brāhmaṇas, seated Rāma
  with Sītā upon a jeweled throne.
'60': >-
  Vasiṣṭha, Vāmadeva, Jābāli, and Kāśyapa; Kātyāyana, Suyajña, Gautama, and
  Vijaya as well—
'61': >-
  consecrated that tiger among men with fragrant, pure water, as the Vasus
  consecrate Vāsava (Indra) of a thousand eyes.
'62': >-
  First the officiating priests and brāhmaṇas anointed him, then maidens and
  ministers, and warriors too—along with the exultant guilds and townsmen.
'63': >-
  He was anointed also with the juices of all healing herbs; by the deities
  stationed in the sky; by the four Guardians of the Worlds; and by all the gods
  assembled together.
'64': >-
  A crown, fashioned long ago by Brahmā and radiant with jewels—by which Manu of
  blazing splendor had formerly been consecrated—
'65': >-
  and by which, in succession, the kings of his lineage were anointed—was set
  forth in that hall fitted with gold and adorned with great wealth,
'66': >-
  beautifully decorated with various splendid gems. Having duly arranged a
  throne made of many jewels according to rule,
'67': >-
  then the great-souled Vasiṣṭha placed the crown upon Rāghava, and the priests
  further adorned him with ornaments at the proper time.
'68': >-
  Śatrughna took up for him a pure, auspicious white parasol; and Sugrīva, lord
  of the Vānaras, took a white chowrie.
'69': >-
  And Vibhīṣaṇa, lord of the Rākṣasas, took another chowrie, moon-bright; and a
  garland blazing in beauty—golden, with a hundred blossoms.
'70': >-
  That garland, united with all jewels and adorned with gems, the Wind-god gave
  to Rāghava at Indra’s behest.
'71': >-
  At Śakra’s prompting, he gave the king a necklace of pearls. The gods and
  Gandharvas sang, and hosts of Apsarases danced.
'72': >-
  At the consecration of wise Rāma—worthy of that honor—earth became rich in
  crops, and the trees bore abundant fruit.
'73': >-
  And flowers became fragrant at Rāghava’s festival. He gave, moreover, a
  hundred thousand horses, and cows and oxen likewise.
'74': >-
  First the bull among men gave a hundred bulls to the twice-born; and again he
  gave thirty crores of gold to the brāhmaṇas.
'75': >-
  Rāghava gave many kinds of ornaments and garments of great value; and a divine
  garland, golden and gem-formed, shining like sunrays,
'76': >-
  to Sugrīva, the lord among men, he presented. And inlaid with vaidūrya gems,
  and adorned with moonlike radiance,
'77': >-
  to Vāli’s son—steadfast Aṅgada—he gave that unsurpassed pearl-necklace set
  with excellent jewels.
'78': >-
  To Sītā he gave garments divine and spotless, and auspicious ornaments, bright
  as moonbeams.
'79': >-
  Vaidehī, looking about, gave to the son of the Wind-god; the daughter of
  Janaka removed from her own neck a necklace and bestowed it.
'80': >-
  Again and again she looked upon all the Vānaras, and upon her lord. Seeing her
  intention, he who knew the signs of the heart spoke to Janaka’s daughter:
'81': >-
  “Bestow, O fair one, this necklace—O passionate lady—upon him with whom you
  are pleased.” Then the dark-eyed lady gave that necklace to the Wind-god’s
  son.
'82': >-
  In whom ever dwell radiance, steadfastness, fame, skill, capability, humility,
  prudence, manliness, valor, prowess, and intelligence—
'83': >-
  Hanumān, that bull among Vānaras, shone with that necklace, like a mountain
  with a white cloud pale as a mass of moonbeams.
'84': >-
  All the aged Vānaras, and the other foremost Vānaras too, were honored as was
  fitting with garments and ornaments.
'85': >-
  Vibhīṣaṇa, Sugrīva, Hanumān, and Jāmbavān, and all the chief Vānaras, were
  honored by Rāma of unwearied deeds.
'86': >-
  All were duly honored with abundant treasures, jewels, and desired gifts; and
  all, their minds delighted, departed just as they had come.
'87': >-
  Then to Dvivida, Mainda, and also Nīla, O scorcher of foes, the lord of the
  earth gave every desirable excellence, seeing all their merits.
'88': >-
  Beholding all this, those great-souled Vānaras—bulls among their
  kind—dismissed by the king of men, went to Kiṣkindhā.
'89': >-
  Sugrīva, the best of Vānaras, having witnessed Rāma’s consecration and having
  been honored by Rāma, entered the city of Kiṣkindhā.
'90': >-
  Vibhīṣaṇa too, righteous-souled, along with the foremost of the Rākṣasas,
  having obtained the wealth of his lineage, set out as a glorious king for
  Laṅkā.
'91': >-
  Thus Rāghava, most generous and of great renown, having slain his foes, ruled
  the entire kingdom with supreme joy. Then Rāma—knower of dharma and devoted to
  dharma—said to Lakṣmaṇa:
'92': >-
  “Assume, O knower of dharma, together with me, this earth formerly inhabited
  by kings, won by might. Equal to me—by whom you have been upheld like a
  father—bear the burden of the prince-regency (yauvarājya).”
'93': >-
  But when Saumitri would not accept that station though entreated with all
  sincerity, then the great-souled one anointed Bharata to the prince-regency
  upon the earth.
'94': >-
  The king’s son performed repeatedly the Puṇḍarīka, the Aśvamedha, and the
  Vājapeya, and also other sacrifices of various kinds.
'95': >-
  Having attained the kingdom, Rāghava ruled for ten thousand years; and he
  performed a hundred Aśvamedha sacrifices, with excellent horses and abundant
  sacrificial fees.
'96': >-
  Rāma, whose arms reached to his knees, broad-chested and mighty in splendor,
  attended by Lakṣmaṇa, ruled this earth.
'97': >-
  Rāghava too, righteous-souled, having obtained the unsurpassed kingdom,
  performed many kinds of sacrifices, together with friends, kinsmen, and
  relations.
'98': >-
  No widows wailed in lamentation, nor was there fear caused by wild beasts; nor
  did fear arising from disease exist, while Rāma ruled the kingdom.
'99': >-
  The world was free of thieves; no one met with misfortune; and the aged did
  not perform the funeral rites of children.
'100': >-
  All was joyful; all became devoted to dharma. Ever beholding Rāma, they did
  not harm one another.
'101': >-
  For thousands of years people had thousands of sons; they were free of
  sickness and sorrow, while Rāma ruled the kingdom.
'102': >-
  “Rāma, Rāma, Rāma”—such were the sayings among the people; the world became as
  though filled with Rāma, while Rāma ruled the kingdom.
'103': >-
  There the trees were ever-rooted and ever-fruiting, and always in bloom; the
  clouds rained according to desire, and the winds were pleasant to the touch.
'104': >-
  Brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, and śūdras—free from greed—were engaged in
  their own duties, content with their respective works.
'105': >-
  The people were devoted to dharma while Rāma ruled; they were not given to
  falsehood. All were endowed with auspicious marks; all were intent upon
  righteousness.
'106': >-
  For ten thousand years and ten hundred years besides, the illustrious Rāma,
  together with his brothers, caused the kingdom to be governed.
'107': >-
  This ancient, ṛṣi-born work—the first epic—was composed long ago by Vālmīki:
  righteous, fame-giving, life-prolonging, and bringing victory to kings.
'108': >-
  The man in the world who always listens to it is freed from sin; one who
  desires sons gains sons, and one who desires wealth gains riches.
'109': >-
  Hearing of Rāma’s consecration, a man in this world obtains these fruits: a
  king conquers the earth and also subdues his enemies.
'110': >-
  As, through Rāghava, Sumitrā had Lakṣmaṇa, and Kaikeyī had Bharata, so too
  will women have living sons.
'111': >-
  They will ever be joyful, endowed with sons and grandsons; and hearing this
  Rāmāyaṇa, one also attains long life.
'112': >-
  Whoever listens to this poem, composed long ago by Vālmīki, and to this entire
  victory of Rāma of unwearied deeds—
'113': >-
  with faith, having conquered anger—he crosses over difficulties; and, meeting
  his kinsmen at the end of exile, he rejoices together with his relatives.
'114': >-
  Those who hear this poem, composed long ago by Vālmīki, obtain here all the
  boons they desire from Rāghava.
'115': >-
  By hearing it, all the gods are pleased for those who listen attentively; and
  the Vināyakas are pacified in the house where it is recited.
'116': >-
  A king would conquer the earth; an exile would return in welfare; and women,
  hearing it during their courses, would bear unsurpassed sons.
'117': >-
  Honoring and reciting this ancient narrative, one would be freed from all sins
  and would obtain long life.
'118': >-
  Having bowed the head daily, it should be heard from a twice-born by
  kṣatriyas; sovereignty and the gaining of sons will arise—of this there is no
  doubt.
'119': >-
  For one who always hears or recites this entire Rāmāyaṇa, Rāma is ever
  pleased; for he is Viṣṇu, the Eternal.
'120': >-
  The primal Deity, the mighty-armed Hari, Nārāyaṇa the Lord—he himself is Rāma,
  best of the Raghus; and Śeṣa is called Lakṣmaṇa.
'121': >-
  Thus is this ancient account. May good be unto you. Proclaim it with
  confidence; may the might of Viṣṇu increase.
'122': >-
  All the gods are pleased by its recitation and likewise by hearing; by hearing
  the Rāmāyaṇa, the Pitṛs are ever satisfied.
'123': >-
  And those men who, with devotion to Rāma, write out this compendium composed
  by the ṛṣi—of them is the abode in heaven (Triviṣṭapa).
'124': >-
  Increase of family, increase of wealth and grain, foremost wives, and the
  highest happiness—having heard this auspicious poem of great meaning, one
  attains every success of purpose upon earth.
'125': >-
  Life-prolonging, health-bestowing, fame-giving, fraternal concord-producing,
  intelligence-enhancing, and auspicious—this powerful narrative should be heard
  with discipline by the good who desire prosperity.
'126': >-
  Thus ends, in the Ṛṣi’s Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa,
  the one-hundred-and-thirty-first canto, called “The Coronation of Śrī Rāma.”
