  Now begins the twelfth canto (sarga) of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Effort to Turn Kaikeyī Back.”
'1': >-
  Then, hearing Kaikeyī’s dreadful words, the great king was seized by anxious
  thought and for a moment was tormented exceedingly.
'2': >-
  “What is this? Is it a dream I see while awake, or is my mind deluded? Or is
  it some calamity that has befallen me—some affliction of the mind?”
'3': >-
  Thinking thus, the king could not at that time comprehend that sorrow; but
  afterwards, regaining consciousness, he was scorched by Kaikeyī’s words.
'4': >-
  Agitated and utterly bewildered—like a deer on seeing a tigress—he sat on the
  bare floor, drawing long, heavy breaths.
'5': >-
  Like a serpent of great venom held fast within a circle by spells, the lord of
  men, filled with wrath, uttered the words, “Ah! Fie upon this!”
'6': >-
  Again he fell into stupefaction, his mind struck down by grief; only after a
  long time did the king, exceedingly afflicted, recover his senses.
'7': >-
  Angered, he said to Kaikeyī, as though burning her with his splendour: “O
  ruthless one, of wicked conduct, destroyer of this dynasty!”
'8': >-
  “What wrong has Rāma done to you, O sinful woman—or what sin have I done?
  Rāghava ever treats you as a mother, like the very author of your birth.”
'9': >-
  “Being so, for what cause are you now risen to bring about this calamity? You,
  planted by me in my own house, have become the ruin of my very life.”
'10': >-
  “Like a she-serpent of sharp venom, O princess, you are so through lack of
  discernment. When all living beings sing the praises of Rāma’s virtues, what
  fault is it of yours?”
'11': >-
  “For what offence shall I abandon my beloved son? Should I even cast away
  Kauśalyā and Sumitrā—should I even renounce prosperity itself?”
'12': >-
  “Rāma is my very life; and he is devoted to his father. My love becomes
  supreme when I behold my eldest son.”
'13': >-
  “When I do not see Rāma, my consciousness itself is lost. The world might
  endure without the sun, or crops without water—”
'14': >-
  “—but my life would not remain in this body without Rāma. Therefore enough!
  Let this resolve be given up, O you who are resolved upon sin.”
'15': >-
  “I even touch your feet with my head—be gracious to me. For what purpose, O
  sinful one, have you devised something so utterly cruel?”
'16': >-
  “Or do you seek to question me about what is dear or not dear to Bharata? Let
  it be as you formerly spoke, in truth, concerning Rāghava.”
'17': >-
  “‘He is my illustrious eldest son, eldest in righteousness as well’—if you,
  sweet-spoken, said that in order to render service, then—”
'18': >-
  “—having heard it, though scorched by grief, you now torment me greatly. You
  have entered this empty house and become subject to another’s will.”
'19': >-
  “O lady of good policy, a very great disgrace has come upon the Ikṣvāku
  line—this disgrace in which your mind has become perverted.”
'20': >-
  “For you never previously did anything improper or displeasing to me, O
  large-eyed one; therefore I do not trust what you say now.”
'21': >-
  “Indeed, you used to tell me many times, O girl, that Rāghava is equal to the
  great-souled Bharata.”
'22': >-
  “How, O timid one, do you approve that righteous and renowned one should dwell
  in the forest for fourteen years?”
'23': >-
  “How do you approve that exceedingly tender one—self-controlled in
  dharma—should live in the forest, so harsh and dreadful?”
'24': >-
  “O fair-eyed one, why do you desire the banishment of charming Rāma, who
  serves you obediently?”
'25': >-
  “Indeed Rāma serves you always even more than Bharata; therefore I do not
  perceive any special partiality in you toward Bharata.”
'26': >-
  “Attendance, reverence, respect for authority, the doing of what is spoken—who
  could do these more than that bull among men?”
'27': >-
  “Among many thousands of women and many dependants, neither slander nor
  reproach can properly attach to Rāghava.”
'28': >-
  “Consoling all beings with a pure mind, Rāma—the tiger among men—wins over the
  inhabitants of his realm by kindness.”
'29': >-
  “By truth Rāghava conquers the worlds; by gifts he wins over the twice-born;
  by service he honours his teachers; and by his bow, in battle, his enemies.”
'30': >-
  “Truth, generosity, austerity, renunciation, friendship, purity,
  straightforwardness, and learning together with reverent service to the
  teacher—these are steadfastly present in Rāghava.”
'31': >-
  “In that one endowed with uprightness, O lady—like a god, godlike—how can you
  wish for sin regarding Rāma, whose splendour equals that of great seers?”
'32': >-
  “I do not recall a single unpleasing word from him who speaks what the world
  loves to hear. How, for your sake, shall I tell Rāma something dear and yet so
  undear?”
'33': >-
  “In him are forgiveness, austerity, renunciation, truth, dharma, gratitude,
  and even non-violence toward beings; without him, what refuge have I?”
'34': >-
  “O Kaikeyī, have compassion on me—old, nearing death, given to
  austerities—who, wretchedly, speak and lament.”
'35': >-
  “Whatever at all is attainable on this earth bounded by the ocean, all that I
  shall give you; only let not anger enter you.”
'36': >-
  “O Kaikeyī, I fold my hands, and I touch your feet as well. Be a refuge to
  Rāma, lest adharma touch me here.”
'37': >-
  Thus, afflicted by sorrow, lamenting senselessly, reeling, the great
  king—overwhelmed by grief—
'38': >-
  again and again begged quickly for the far shore of the ocean of sorrow; then
  Kaikeyī, fierce, replied with words still fiercer:
'39': >-
  “If, O king, having bestowed the two boons you afterwards repent, how, O hero,
  will you proclaim your righteousness upon the earth?”
'40': >-
  “When many royal sages, assembled together with you, speak of it, O knower of
  dharma, what will you answer there?”
'41': >-
  “You will say: ‘By me a falsehood was done to Kaikeyī, by whose favour I live,
  and who protected me.’”
'42': >-
  “You will commit a sin among kings, O lord of men, if today, having given a
  boon, you speak other words again.”
'43': >-
  “Śaibya, in the tale of the hawk and the dove, gave his own flesh to the bird;
  and Alarka, giving away his eyes, went to the highest state.”
'44': >-
  “The ocean, having made an agreement, does not transgress the shoreline.
  Remembering the deeds of old, do not make the agreement false.”
'45': >-
  “But you, abandoning dharma, having consecrated Rāma to the kingdom, wish
  always to sport with Kauśalyā—O ill-minded one!”
'46': >-
  “Let it be dharma or let it be adharma; let it be truth or let it be
  untruth—what you have promised to me admits of no transgression.”
'47': >-
  “For I, drinking poison this very day in your presence, will die before your
  eyes if Rāma is consecrated.”
'48': >-
  “If for even one day I should see the mother of Rāma receiving folded hands
  (in reverence), then death—indeed—would be better for me.”
'49': >-
  “By Bharata—by my very self—I swear to you, O lord of men: I shall not be
  satisfied by anything else except the banishment of Rāma.”
'50': >-
  Having spoken only so much, Kaikeyī fell silent, and she did not reply to the
  king who was lamenting.
'51': >-
  But the king, hearing Kaikeyī’s exceedingly fine-sounding words—Rāma’s
  dwelling in the forest and Bharata’s lordship—
'52': >-
  did not speak to Kaikeyī for a while, his senses confounded; unblinking, he
  stared at the queen, dear yet speaking what was not dear.
'53': >-
  For, hearing that thunderbolt-like speech, hateful to the heart, filled with
  sorrow and grief, the king found no happiness.
'54': >-
  Considering the queen’s dreadful resolve and the terrible oath she had made,
  and sighing “Rāma!”, he fell like a tree cut down.
'55': >-
  Like one whose mind is lost, like a madman, like a sick man gone astray—bereft
  of his splendour like a serpent whose venom is taken away—so became the lord
  of the earth.
'56': >-
  Then, in a feeble, distressed voice, he said to Kaikeyī: “By whom were you
  instructed in this misfortune that has the appearance of advantage?”
'57': >-
  “Speaking to me like one whose mind is struck by spirits, are you not ashamed?
  This addiction to wickedness of yours I did not know before.”
'58': >-
  “But now I see in you—like a childish girl—something utterly perverse. From
  where has fear arisen in you, that you ask for such a boon?”
'59': >-
  “You choose Bharata seated on the throne, and Rāghava in the forest. Cease
  this intention, and cease this untruth as well.”
'60': >-
  “If you wish to do what is dear to your husband, to the people, and to
  Bharata—O ruthless one, of sinful intent, petty, doer of evil—”
'61': >-
  “—what sorrow, or what false fault, do you see in me and in Rāma? In no manner
  would Bharata accept the kingdom apart from Rāma.”
'62': >-
  “Indeed, I consider him stronger than Rāma in dharma; how shall I look upon
  Rāma when I say, ‘Go to the forest’?”
'63': >-
  “My face would become pale, as though the moon were eclipsed—how will that
  good resolve of mine, decided together with friends,”
'64': >-
  “be seen as turned back—like an army struck down by others and routed? What
  will the kings, gathered from many directions, say to me?”
'65': >-
  “‘Alas, the Ikṣvāku boy ruled a long time!’—when many elders, virtuous and
  learned,”
'66': >-
  “question the Kakutstha prince, how then shall I say here: ‘My son was exiled
  by me while Kaikeyī was distressing me’?”
'67': >-
  “If I speak this as truth, it will become false. What will Kauśalyā say to me
  when Rāghava has taken to the forest?”
'68': >-
  “And what shall I answer her, having done such a displeasing deed—she who,
  again and again, as a servant and as a friend,”
'69': >-
  attends upon me as a wife, as a sister, and as a mother—ever desiring what is
  dear to me, blessed with a dear son, sweet-speaking.
'70': >-
  “That goddess, worthy of honour, was never honoured by me as she deserved,
  because of you. That now burns me—that I did you a good turn.”
'71': >-
  “Like a sick man who has eaten food mixed with unsuitable condiments, I am
  pained by this strange turn—Rāma’s departure and his going to the forest.”
'72': >-
  “Sumitrā, seeing this, will be frightened—how will she trust me? And poor
  Vaidehī will hear a pair of unpleasing tidings.”
'73': >-
  “Seeing me fallen into death, and Rāma taking refuge in the forest—Vaidehī,
  lamenting for my life-breaths, will waste away.”
'74': >-
  “Like a kinnarī bereft of her kinnara upon the side of Himavat, I, not seeing
  Rāma departing to the great forest,”
'75': >-
  “shall not hope to live long—nor shall I endure seeing Maithilī weeping.
  Surely you will rule the kingdom as a widow, though with a son.”
'76': >-
  “I had firmly regarded you as entirely chaste; yet the chaste one I now deem
  unchaste—like a man who, having drunk liquor, finds it mixed with poison.”
'77': >-
  “With false consolations you used to soothe me and speak—like a greedy hunter
  who, luring with song, kills a deer.”
'78': >-
  “The noble will surely call me ‘ignoble’, a seller of my son, in the
  streets—like a Brāhmaṇa who drinks liquor, dragged about in shame.”
'79': >-
  “Ah, what sorrow! Ah, what hardship—that your words can be so! Such suffering
  has come, as though from some evil deed done in the past.”
'80': >-
  “For long, O sinful one, you have been guarded by me—through sin and
  ignorance—like a rope procured only to hang oneself.”
'81': >-
  “Sporting together with you, I did not perceive you as death—like a child in
  secret touching with his hand a black serpent.”
'82': >-
  “This whole world of living beings should surely revile me—that by me, a
  wicked-souled man, that great-souled son has been made fatherless.”
'83': >-
  “Truly foolish, ruled by desire, is King Daśaratha indeed—he who, for a
  woman’s sake, will send his beloved son to the forest.”
'84': >-
  “Oppressed by the Vedas, by brahmacarya, and by his teachers, at the time of
  enjoyment he will fall again into great hardship.”
'85': >-
  “My son is not fit to reply to me with a second word; when told, ‘Go to the
  forest,’ he will simply say, ‘So be it.’”
'86': >-
  “If my Rāghava, when urged, were to do what is contrary and go to the forest,
  it would oddly seem dear to me; but my child will not do so.”
'87': >-
  “When Rāghava has gone to the forest, despised by all the world,
  death—irresistible—will take me to Yama’s imperishable abode.”
'88': >-
  “When I am dead and Rāma—the foremost of men—has gone to the forest, with my
  beloved people still remaining, what sin will you then attain?”
'89': >-
  “If Kauśalyā loses me and Rāma and her sons, that queen, unable to bear the
  sorrows, will follow me alone.”
'90': >-
  “Casting Kauśalyā, Sumitrā, and me—together with the three sons—into hell,
  then, O Kaikeyī, be happy!”
'91': >-
  “The Ikṣvāku dynasty—eternal, honoured for its virtues, unshakable—abandoned
  by me and by Rāma, you will rule in utter turmoil.”
'92': >-
  “If this banishment of Rāma were dear to Bharata, may Bharata never perform my
  funeral rites when my life is gone.”
'93': >-
  “When I am dead and Rāma—the bull among men—has gone to the forest, then
  indeed you will rule the kingdom as a widow, though with a son.”
'94': >-
  “O princess, by fate you dwelt in my house; for me there will surely be
  boundless infamy in the world, fixed humiliation, and contempt among all
  beings—like that of a doer of sin.”
'95': >-
  “How will Rāma—my dear child—walk on foot in the great wilderness, he who was
  wont to travel powerfully by chariots and again by elephants and horses?”
'96': >-
  “At whose mealtimes cooks wearing earrings, placing me first in honour, used
  to prepare with delight drink and food—”
'97': >-
  “—how indeed will my son live, eating forest fare—brown, bitter, and pungent
  things?”
'98': >-
  “Accustomed long to ease, clothed in most precious garments—how shall Rāma
  come to wear the ochre robe?”
'99': >-
  “Whose is this dreadful utterance, spoken in such a manner—Rāma’s going to the
  forest and Bharata’s consecration?”
'100': >-
  “Fie upon women indeed—deceitful, intent on their own advantage! Yet I do not
  speak of all women—only of Bharata’s mother.”
'101': >-
  “In the guise of benefit you pursue calamity; ruthless, you were placed by me
  only for my torment. What displeasure do you see, on account of me, in one who
  imitates what is wholesome—or perhaps in Rāma?”
'102': >-
  “Fathers would even abandon sons, and wives their beloved husbands; the entire
  world would be enraged, merely on seeing Rāma sunk in misfortune.”
'103': >-
  “But I—seeing that son, handsome as a young god, adorned, returning toward
  me—I rejoice at the sight; and merely by beholding him I become young again,
  as it were.”
'104': >-
  “Without the sun there can be no activity, even if the wielder of the
  thunderbolt sends no rain; but beholding Rāma departing from here, my mind
  knows: none could live.”
'105': >-
  “Desiring ruin, unbeneficial, an enemy, I have housed you—like death
  itself—within me. Long indeed you have been held upon my lap, a she-serpent of
  great venom; therefore, through delusion, I am slain.”
'106': >-
  “Deprived of me, of Rāma, and of Lakṣmaṇa, let Bharata together with you
  govern—having destroyed the city and the realm, and having slain
  kinsmen—rejoicing in what is harmful to me.”
'107': >-
  “O you of cruel conduct, striking down in calamity! Speaking by force today
  such words here—do your teeth not fall down from your mouth, shattered a
  thousandfold?”
'108': >-
  “Rāma knows not how to speak a harsh word, nor anything harmful or unpleasing;
  how then, in Rāma—sweetly spoken, ever esteemed for virtue—do you speak of
  faults?”
'109': >-
  “Go—wither, or burn, or perish; or, splitting into a thousand pieces, sink
  into the earth: I shall not do your exceedingly cruel word, harmful to me, O
  disgrace of the king of Kekaya!”
'110': >-
  “Razor-like, ever speaking what is untrue yet pleasing, of corrupted intent,
  destroyer of your own lineage—unlovely— I cannot bear to live with you, who
  would burn my heart together with its bonds.”
'111': >-
  “For me there is no life—whence happiness? Without one’s own son, whence can
  there be delight for those who love themselves? O lady, you ought not to do
  what is harmful to me. I touch your feet also—be gracious to me.”
'112': >-
  That protector of the earth, lamenting like one without refuge, his heart
  seized beyond measure by a woman, fell at the queen’s two feet stretched
  forth—having reached them—like a man in agony.
'113': >-
  Thus ends the twelfth canto (sarga) of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa in the Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the sacred composition of the seers, the first epic, called “The
  Effort to Turn Kaikeyī Back.”
