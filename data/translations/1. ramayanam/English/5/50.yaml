  Now begins the fiftieth sarga of the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, named “Prahasta’s Questioning.”
'1': >-
  Beholding that tawny-eyed monkey standing before him, the mighty-armed
  Rāvaṇa—terrifier of the worlds—was seized by a great fury.
'2': >-
  His mind struck by doubt, he pondered upon the lord of monkeys, encompassed
  with blazing splendour: “Could this be the divine Nandī himself, come here in
  person?”
'3': >-
  “He by whom I was once cursed on Kailāsa, when I formerly laughed in
  scorn—could he be this one, come in a monkey’s form? Or might he even be some
  terrible shaft (missile) in that shape?”
'4': >-
  Then that king, his eyes reddened with wrath, addressed Prahasta—foremost
  among ministers—speaking at the fitting time, in words expansive and full of
  meaning:
'5': >-
  “Let this evil-souled one be questioned: From where has he come, and what is
  the cause of his coming? What purpose had he in breaking the grove, and in
  challenging and taunting the rākṣasas?”
'6': >-
  “What is the aim of coming to my city, truly hard to assail? Or what business
  has he in battle? Let this misguided one be questioned.”
'7': >-
  Hearing Rāvaṇa’s words, Prahasta spoke to him: “Be at ease; welfare be to you.
  You need not feel fear on account of this monkey.”
'8': >-
  “If indeed you have been sent by Indra to the dwelling of Rāvaṇa, then declare
  the truth. Let there be no fear for you, O monkey—you shall be released.”
'9': >-
  “If you have entered this our city after assuming this fair form—whether as
  the agent of Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera), or of Yama, or of Varuṇa—”
'10': >-
  “Or if you have been sent as a messenger by Viṣṇu, who seeks victory—surely
  the might within you is not that of a mere monkey; only the form is that of a
  monkey.”
'11': >-
  “Therefore, tell the truth today; then, O monkey, you shall be set free. But
  for one who speaks falsehood, even life becomes hard to obtain.”
'12': >-
  “Or else, for whatever reason you have entered the abode of Rāvaṇa—” Thus
  addressed, the best of monkeys then replied to the lord of the hosts of
  rākṣasas:
'13': >-
  “I am not of Śakra (Indra), nor of Yama, nor of Varuṇa. I have no alliance
  with the Lord of Wealth (Kubera), and I have not been impelled by Viṣṇu.”
'14': >-
  “This indeed is my very birth and kind: I am a monkey who has come here. To
  behold the lord of rākṣasas—this has been attained by me, though it is
  difficult to obtain.”
'15': >-
  “The grove of the king of rākṣasas was laid waste by me for the sake of seeing
  him. Thereupon your rākṣasas came—mighty ones, desirous of battle.”
'16': >-
  “And for the protection of my own body I fought back against them in combat.
  Even by gods and asuras I could not be bound with nooses of missiles.”
'17': >-
  “And this boon granted to me by the Grandfather (Brahmā) has indeed come to
  bear here. Desiring to see the king, I submitted myself to that weapon (and
  its restraint).”
'18': >-
  “Though I was released by the weapon, I was nevertheless brought to your
  notice by the rākṣasas. For a certain task of Rāma I have come into your
  presence.”
'19': >-
  “Knowing me to be a messenger of the immeasurably mighty Rāghava, hear these
  words of mine—wholesome and beneficial, O lord.”
'20': >-
  Thus ends the fiftieth sarga of the Sundara Kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, named “Prahasta’s Questioning.”
