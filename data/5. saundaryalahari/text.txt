First Part - The Waves of Bliss!

tvam-Eva sharaNaM
(You alone are the refuge)
	shivE

	(for those who commit mistakes in you)

To those who slip and fall on the ground,
the ground itself offers support!
Similarly, for those who commit mistakes in your worship,
you alone offer refuge, O Goddess!

Someone as powerful as lord shiva himself, is only capable of action, when he is united with shakti. 
If he is not united with shakti, he is not even capable of even reacting to situations; 
or in other words, he becomes inert! If such is your importance when it comes to performing action, 
then how O Great Goddess, can someone perform your worship or praise, 
without having done any good deed! In other words, one must be really fortunate 
and must have accumulated a lot of virtue, to even attempt praising or worshipping you!

O Goddess! Lord brahmA collects the dust below your feet, and from it, 
creates all these worlds to perfection! Lord viShNu with thousands of heads maintains these worlds 
with great effort, and Lord shiva, with utmost reverence powders these worlds 
back into sacred ash and smears it all over his body.

O Goddess! These particles are like an island from which arises the Sun, 
who dispels the darkness of ignorance. They are like a delicious torrent of honey 
which causes brightness and invigorates the dull ones! They are like a garland of precious jewels 
for those who are struck with poverty, and for those who are drowned in the sorrows of life and death, 
they are like the tusks of Lord varAha, who saved Mother Earth from drowning in the oceans!

O Goddess, who is the refuge to the people of all worlds, Gods and Goddesses other than you 
display abhaya:fear dispelling and varada:boon providing mudras with both their hands. 
You alone never display these varada and abhaya mudras since your feet themselves 
are adept at removing the fears and fulfilling the desires of the beings of all the worlds!

Worshipping you, who bestows prosperity upon all your devotees, hari(viShNu) 
was able to become a charming female and stir waves of passion in the minds of no less a deity 
than hara, the Destroyer of the Three Cities! And smara(manmatha, the lord of love), 
through your worship, obtained a form— which is truly a feast for the eyes of his consort ratI devI, 
with which he has become capable of causing deep infatuation even in the minds of sages!

His bow is made only of flowers; its bow-string is a line of honey-bees; he has only five arrows, 
and these are made of flowers too! His minister is the(periodical and non-dependable) spring season; 
his battle-chariot is the(shifting and formless) breeze; and above all, he is ananga, 
the bodiless one. Yet, O Daughter of the Mountain! blessed by your gracious side-glance, 
he, by himself alone, is victorious over the entire world!

May the mother Goddess, who has a jingling waistband, whose breasts are curved 
like the temples of a young elephant cub, whose waist is slender, whose face is as bright 
as the fully formed moon of sharad Rtu, who holds a bow, arrows, a noose and a goad in her four hands, 
and who is the great consort of lord shiva, who vanquished tripurAsura, be present in front of us!

O Goddess! Situated in the middle of the milky ocean, surrounded by a garden of celestial trees, 
within an island of jewels, containing an orchard of kadamba trees; 
Within a house made of chintAmaNi jewels, resting upon the seat which is lord paramashiva himself 
- this is how the truly fortunate worship you, who is the very embodiment of the waves 
of ultimate conscious bliss, called as chidAnanda.

Having penetrated the pRthvI(Earth) element situated in the mUlAdhAra, 
The jala(Water)  element in the maNipUraka, the agni(Fire) element in the svAdhiShThAna, 
the vAyu(Air) element in the anAhata, the AkAsha(Space) element above it, in the vishuddhi, 
and manas(Mind) in the AjnA between the eye-brows, you, ascending through the suShumnA 
or the kula path, are engaged in loving sport with your consort 
in the solitude of sahasrAra, the thousand-Petalled Lotus!

Drenching the whole creation, with the nectar flowing down from both your feet, 
you descend from the exuberance of the Nectarine Radiance of the Moon. 
You flow down into your own abode in the mUlAdhAra at the lower end of the suShumnA, 
assuming your coiled serpentine form, and lie dormant there.

		tri-rekhAbhiH

The four shrI-kanThas(shiva-chakras) and the five shiva-yuvatis(shakti-chakras) are 
the nine mUla-prakRtis(basic manifestations), punctuated by the bindu 
or the origin-point, in the centre. Then there are two lotuses, one of eight petals 
and another of sixteen, and then the three surrounding circles and then, three lines. 
This forms your mansion with forty-four sharaNa-koNas(Places of Refuge).

O Daughter of the Snow-Capped-Mountain! The greatest of poets like brahmA — try in many ways 
to portray your beauty, and fail to find any other object to describe it through comparison. 
The kind of beauty through which even the celestial damsels, out of their eagerness to experience it, 
attain to the State of Oneness with shiva, which is difficult to gain, even by severe austerities!

If your gracious side-glance falls on even a very decrepit old man who is ugly to look at, 
and whose erotic sensibilities are inert, he will be followed in all haste, 
by hundreds of love-lorn young women, with their locks scattered, 
with their upper garments disturbed from their vessels like breasts, 
their waist-bands undone in the sudden excitement, and their drapes slipping away!

		(with the Sun, and Moon as Her pair of breasts)

O consort of hara! By correlating your face, as the bindu; the pair of breasts, as the part below it; 
and your form, as the half of hara himself; one who meditates upon your manmathakaLA thus, 
such a person shall be able to attract the mind of any woman! In fact, this is of such little consequence, 
because such a person shall be able to attract the entire existence, 
which can be embodied as a beautiful woman with the Sun and Moon for her breasts.

The one who meditates upon you, who radiates luminescence from your body, just as a moonstone does,
such a person becomes capable of humbling the pride and ferocity of serpents, like garuDa himself!
Such a person becomes capable of comforting someone afflicted with fever, by his mere gaze
which is as soothing as a stream of nectar!

appearing at sahasrAra, above all the six chakras.

O Goddess! The one who seeks to praise you with the words, "bhavAni tvam dAse mayi 
vitara dRShTim sakaruNAm", which means, "O bhavAni, you please shower your compassionate glances 
upon this poor servant of yours!", you grant him the very abode of unity with your own self! 
That abode, which shines with the light reflected from the crowns of the very likes of brahmA, 
viShNu and shiva, who bow down with their heads before it! This is because the very first words 
in such a prayer, "bhavAni tvam" in Sanskrit also have the meaning of "I must be you!"

Not being satisfied even after occupying the left half of shiva, 
I wonder if you have occupied his right half too!
I think so, since I perceive that form to be glowing red completely, with three eyes,
slightly crouched forward due to the heaviness of your bosom, 
with a curved crescent moon on your crown!

brahmA gives birth to this existence, viShNu sustains it, and rudra destroys it. 
Isha reverses the whole process absorbing all of it into his own self.
sadAshiva conducts all this through the power of his grace!
All these five, perform these activities upon receiving your command, 
conveyed through a momentary movement of your eyebrows!

O Auspicious One! The worship of all the three Gods, brahmA, viShNu and shiva, 
born out of the three gunas, is considered to be performed as soon as your feet are worshipped!
It is because all these deities are situated at the base of your abode, the maNidvIpa(shrI chakra), 
by holding their hands clasped in prayer above their heads!

virinchi(brahmA) is reduced into elements, hari(viShNu) attains to passiveness, 
kInAsha(yama, the god of death) is himself destroyed; kubera, the god of wealth meets his end; 
and indra, along with all his followers have their eyes shut during dissolution. 
In that time of total dissolution(mahAsaMhAra) of the universe, 
O Goddess, your husband sadAshiva alone is the one who plays!

Even after consuming sudhA(divine-nectar), which removes the fears of old age and death, 
devas like brahmA and indra perish during the time of the cosmic dissolution.
On the other hand, despite consuming the terrible poison of hAlAhala, 
there is no end to your consort, shiva! 
O Mother, this is indeed due to the unending glory of your ear-ornaments!

O Eternal Mother Who Is Worshipped By All! What is surprising about the fact, 
that someone who meditates upon you, identifying oneself with you, 
as being surrounded by the divine forces like aNimA, emanating like rays out of your body,
such a person discards even the riches of enlightenment, and even the cosmic dissolution 
can only be an offering of nIrAjana to such a person!

as the consort of chidAnandAkAra(shiva-embodiment of the bliss of consciousness)!

In your vishuddhi-chakra, I offer my service to lord shiva, who shines like clear crystal,

through the brilliance of whose moon-like shine, the entire creation, 
rid of its impurities, rejoices like a chakorI bird!

Next, I worship the pair of haMsas that dwell in the hearts of great beings,

Through the mutual songs of which, one masters all the 18 systems of knowledge, 
and which separates one's virtues from vices, like separating milk from water!

O Mother, in your svAdhiShThAna chakra, I worship the pair of you as saMvarta

The enraged sight of which ends up in the burning up of all worlds,
and the compassionate glance of which provides cool and pleasant relief!

In the maNipUraka-chakra, I worship the one who is like the darkness-dispelling lightning,

that brings its showers cooling down the three-worlds heated up by the Sun-like shiva!

In your mUlAdhAra chakra, I meditate upon the navAtman(lord shiva), 
engaged in the maha-tANDava, with all the nava-rasas, in the company of samayA(devI shakti) 
engaged in a pleasant-lAsya. I perceive that it is because of this mutual dance, 
graciously aimed towards the birth of creation, that this existence now has a father and a mother!

that the crescent moon on your head, reflecting various colours from the hem of your golden crown, 
is verily lord indra's bow itself!?

O Auspicious Goddess! May your tresses of hair, resembling a forest of full-blown blue lotuses,

I presume that the heavenly flowers of indra’s garden have taken a place in your hair 
to imbibe a little of their natural fragrance!

O Goddess! The partition of hair on your head, which looks like the path of a flowing stream, 
that carries the waves of beauty emanating from your face, 
which, being smeared by sindUra(Vermillion) appears like the penetrating beam 
of early-morning sunlight being bound on both sides by its enemy, the pitch-darkness of the night, 
caused by your thick dark locks of hair, cover us with well-being!

O Goddess! The beauty of your face covered in naturally curly and thick locks of hair, 
resembling shining bumblebees, mocks at the famed beauty of a lotus,
since compared to a mere lotus, your lotus-like face, with its fragrance being emanated 
by the sweet pollen-like teeth when you smile, is causing intoxication 
to the bumblebees which are verily the dark-eyes of lord shiva!

being invincible(ayodhyA), being a stream of compassion(dhArA), being utterly sweet(madhurA),

as if they have undertaken the task of creating the cosmic trinity of brahmA, 
viShNu, and shiva, out of their three qualities of rajas, sattva and tamas, once again!

you cause the three holy streams of gangA, yamunA and sarasvatI 
and also their confluence, with an intention to purify us!

This is because, your long side-glances across the ridges reaching up to your ears 
give the impression of an arrow mounted on a bow-string!

the valiant manmatha goes to war!

O Goddess who has a unique expertise of the rhythm and the flow of music, 
the three folds on your neck are indicative of the number of knots tied 
with the mangaLa-sUtra at the time of marriage! They shine forth, 
as if representing the positions, and guidelines of music, which are three grAmas, 
out of which various sweet rAgas spring forth!

the vanquisher of andhakAsura, who ripped of his fifth head once before, and therefore wishes 
to have your four hands granting protection over the rest of his four heads!

confused, starts checking the bulges of his own forehead with his trunk!

and which reflect within them the reddish hue of your lower-lip, making it shine 
like the glorious valour of lord shiva, smeared with the blood of the vanquished tripurAsura!

and like the richness of poetic brilliance! Provided by you out of your compassion, 
this child born between the three oceans, having relished it, 
gave birth to beautiful poetry among the best of the poets!

We sing the prayers of these charmingly beautiful pair of feet of yours, 
which are smeared with shining red-dye! It is desiring the touch of these feet, 
that the lord of creatures, IshAna, feels jealous of the ashoka trees 
that you tread upon in your graden!

When your husband made an error and referred to you by the name of gangA, 
and bowed his head in shame, and when you struck him on his forehead with your lotus-like feet, 
immediately, manmatha, who resides in your feet, and who was once reduced to ashes 
by his enemy, lord shiva, let out a burst of laughter, 
in the form of the tinkling of the series of bells on your anklets!

There's the lotus which shrivels up in the snow, and there are your feet 
which are skilled in treading the snow-capped-mountains! There's the lotus which sleeps in the night, 
and there are your feet which shine even in the darkest of the night! There's the lotus which is held 
by the grace of the Goddess of wealth, lakShmI, and there are your feet 
which grant even the utmost of riches to your devotees! O Mother! What is surprising in the fact 
that the pair of your feet win over the splendour of a lotus!?

which grant ultimate abode, and which remove all obstacles, 
are compared by the pious ones with something as hard as a tortoise-shell in their poetry!
How is it that these gentle pair of feet have been placed on top of the hard 
grinding stone during marriage ritual by the cruel-hearted lord shiva!

which makes the lotus-like palms of the celestial women fold in prayer;
and which grant utmost of riches immediately to even the most destitute of beings;
seem to be mocking in laugher, at the celestial tree, kalpavRkSha,

which grants the fruits of well-being to those who are already well-to-do!

from a series of radiant bells adorning your anklets, as if teaching them a rhythm to follow!

and is causing utmost pleasantness to the eyes!

may this reddish-compassionate feminine aspect of lord shambhu be ever victorious!
