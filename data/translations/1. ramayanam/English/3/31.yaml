  Now begins the thirty-first canto in the Aranya-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, entitled “Ravana Learns of the Fate of Khara.”
'1': >-
  Then Akampana, hurrying away from Janasthana, entered Lanka with great speed
  and spoke these words to Ravana.
'2': >-
  “O king, many rakshasas who dwelt in Janasthana have been slain. And Khara too
  has been killed in battle; somehow, I alone have come back alive.”
'3': >-
  Thus addressed, Dasagriva (Ravana), enraged, his eyes reddened with fury,
  spoke to Akampana, as though burning him with his very splendor.
'4': >-
  “By whom has dreadful Janasthana—so dear to me as my very life—been destroyed?
  Who in all the worlds would not come to grief (by provoking me)?”
'5': >-
  “Having done what is displeasing to me, not even Maghavan (Indra) can attain
  happiness—nor can Vaishravana (Kubera), nor Yama, nor Vishnu.”
'6': >-
  “I am the very Death even of Time; I could burn even fire itself. I am able to
  yoke Death to death’s own law.”
'7': >-
  “I am able even to strike down the wind’s speed by the force of the wind. If
  enraged, I could, with my radiance, burn even the Sun and Fire.”
'8': >-
  Seeing Dasagriva thus wrathful, Akampana, with joined palms, in fear, begged
  Ravana for safety in a voice that faltered with uncertainty.
'9': >-
  Dasagriva, the foremost of rakshasas, granted him fearlessness. Then Akampana,
  reassured, spoke words that were clear and without doubt.
'10': >-
  “There is the son of Dasaratha—youthful, with a lion-like build—named Rama,
  broad-shouldered, with mighty arms extending to his knees.”
'11': >-
  “Dark-hued, of wide renown, illustrious, possessing incomparable strength and
  valor—by him, in Janasthana, Khara was slain along with Dushana.”
'12': >-
  Hearing Akampana’s words, Ravana, lord of the rakshasas, sighed like a king of
  serpents and then spoke these words.
'13': >-
  “Tell me, Akampana—did Rama come to Janasthana allied with Indra and with all
  the immortals?”
'14': >-
  Hearing Ravana’s further question, Akampana described in full the strength and
  the prowess of that great-souled Rama.
'15': >-
  “Rama, of great splendor, is the foremost among all archers; endowed with the
  excellences of divine missiles, he stands established in the highest
  righteousness even in battle.”
'16': >-
  “His younger brother Lakshmana is strong, red-eyed, with a voice like the
  sound of a war-drum, his face resembling the moon on a clear autumn night.”
'17': “United with him, Rama—like wind joined with fire—has cast down Janasthana.”
'18': >-
  “No deliberation is needed here, nor do even the mighty gods matter in this
  affair: the arrows released by Rama—gold-feathered, swift as birds—”
'19': >-
  “—become five-headed serpents and devour the rakshasas. Whichever way the
  rakshasas flee, driven by fear,”
'20': >-
  “in that very direction they behold Rama himself standing before them. Thus, O
  sinless one, has your Janasthana been destroyed by him.”
'21': >-
  Hearing Akampana’s words, Ravana spoke: “I shall go to Janasthana to slay Rama
  together with Lakshmana.”
'22': >-
  When Ravana had spoken thus, Akampana replied: “Hear, O king, what truly
  occurred—Rama’s strength and manly prowess.”
'23': >-
  “Rama, famed far and wide, when angered, is unconquerable by valor. With his
  arrows he could ward off the rushing flood of a river in full spate.”
'24': >-
  “He could cause the very sky—with its stars, planets, and constellations—to
  sink into ruin; and that illustrious Rama could lift up the earth itself if it
  were foundering.”
'25': >-
  “He, the mighty one, could split the ocean’s boundary and inundate the worlds;
  with his arrows he could disperse the ocean’s force—or even the wind.”
'26': >-
  “Or, gathering up the worlds again by his valor, that best of men—so
  renowned—would be able even to create living beings anew.”
'27': >-
  “Rama, O Dasagriva, cannot be conquered by you in battle—nor even by the
  entire world of rakshasas—just as heaven cannot be won by sinners.”
'28': >-
  “I do not deem him killable even by all the devas and asuras together. Yet
  there is one means for his destruction—listen with single-minded attention to
  that.”
'29': >-
  “His wife, supreme in the world, is named Sita—slender-waisted, dark-hued,
  with limbs perfectly proportioned— a jewel among women, adorned with precious
  ornaments.”
'30': >-
  “Neither goddess, nor gandharvi, nor apsara, nor naga-maiden is equal to that
  noble lady; how then could any human woman compare?”
'31': >-
  “Abduct his wife, after overpowering him in the great forest. Deprived of
  Sita, Rama will no longer be the same (will not be able to stand as before).”
'32': >-
  That counsel pleased Ravana, lord of the rakshasas. Having reflected, the
  mighty-armed one spoke to Akampana.
'33': >-
  “So be it. Tomorrow, I shall go alone with my charioteer, and I shall bring
  Vaidehi (Sita) to this great city, rejoicing.”
'34': >-
  Saying this, Ravana set out in a chariot yoked with asses, radiant as the sun,
  illuminating all directions.
'35': >-
  That great chariot of the lord of rakshasas, moving along the path of the
  stars, shone forth as it sped on—like the moon amid the clouds.
'36': >-
  Going a long distance, he approached the hermitage of the son of Tadaka
  (Maricha). The king was honored by Maricha with unearthly foods and drinks.
'37': >-
  After personally welcoming him with a seat and with water, Maricha spoke, in
  words weighted with purpose and meaning:
'38': >-
  “Is all well with you, O king, O lord of the rakshasas, and with your peoples?
  I suspect some cause for concern, since you have come so swiftly.”
'39': >-
  Thus addressed by Maricha, Ravana of great splendor, skilled in speech, then
  spoke these words.
'40': >-
  “My guard, dear one, has been slain by Rama of unwearied action; that
  Janasthana—thought invulnerable—has been utterly laid low in battle.”
'41': >-
  “Therefore assist me in this undertaking: the abduction of his wife.” Hearing
  the words of the lord of rakshasas, Maricha replied:
'42': >-
  “By whom has Sita been spoken of to you—a foe in the guise of a friend? O
  tiger among rakshasas, who would not rejoice in you, so worthy of rejoicing
  in?”
'43': >-
  “Who is it that tells you, ‘Bring Sita here’? Tell me. Who wishes to cut off
  the very peak of the entire realm of rakshasas?”
'44': >-
  “Whoever urges you on is certainly your enemy; he desires that you yourself
  should try to pull out a tusk from the mouth of a venomous serpent.”
'45': >-
  “By what deed have you been led onto this evil path? O king, whose blow has
  struck your head while you slept in comfort?”
'46': >-
  “You, whose hands are firm upon pride born of pure lineage and noble descent,
  whose arms stand like horns in their might—O Ravana, it is not fitting here to
  challenge in battle that elephant of the Raghu line, that wielder of Rama’s
  scent (fame).”
'47': >-
  “He is a man-lion, a hunter of cunning rakshasa-beasts, steadfast in the
  postures, pauses, and junctions of combat; you cannot awaken him if he lies
  asleep—his bow is strung, and his sharp arrows are like fangs of a whetted
  sword.”
'48': >-
  “In that dreadful, bottomless hell that is Rama—where the taking up of bows is
  like a bog of arm-strength, where arrows are the garland of waves, where the
  flood is a vast onrush of battle—O king of rakshasas, it is not right to
  plunge.”
'49': >-
  “Be gracious, O lord of Lanka, O chief of rakshasas. Return in peace; go
  rightly. Take delight always in your own wives; let Rama, with his wife,
  delight in the forests.”
'50': >-
  Thus addressed by Maricha, Dasagriva—Ravana—turned back, entered the city of
  Lanka, and went into his excellent palace.
'51': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-first canto of the Aranya-kanda in the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Adi-kavya, entitled “Ravana Learns of the Fate of Khara.”
