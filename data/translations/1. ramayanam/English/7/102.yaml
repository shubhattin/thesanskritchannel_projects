  Now, in the sacred, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins
  the two-hundred-and-second sarga, named “The Founding (Settlement) of Aṅgada
  and Candraketu (in their cities and realms).”
'1': >-
  Hearing that, Rāghava (Śrī Rāma), together with his brothers, was filled with
  joy; and then he spoke to Lakṣmaṇa words that were wondrous in their import.
'2': >-
  “O Saumitrī (Lakṣmaṇa), these two princes—Aṅgada and Candraketu—are
  well-versed in dharma, steadfast in valour, and firm in prowess for the sake
  of kingship (the charge of ruling).”
'3': >-
  “I shall anoint these two to sovereignty; therefore let a region be rightly
  assigned (for them). It should be delightful and unconfined, where these two
  bow-bearing warriors may dwell in happiness.”
'4': >-
  “Where there would be no affliction to the king (and his subjects), nor any
  destruction of hermitages—let such a land be sought out, O gentle one, so that
  we may not become blameworthy.”
'5': >-
  When Rāma had spoken thus, Bharata replied: “Here is the region called
  Kāru-path(a); it is delightful and free from disease.”
'6': >-
  “Let a city be established there for the great-souled Aṅgada; and for
  Candraketu, a most beautiful city—named Candrakānta—free from disease.”
'7': >-
  That counsel spoken by Bharata, Rāghava accepted; and having brought that
  region under control, he settled it for Aṅgada.
'8': >-
  Aṅgadīyā—Aṅgada’s city—fair to behold, was established for Aṅgada by Rāma, he
  whose deeds are unwearied and unfailing; it was charming and well-protected.
'9': >-
  And for Candraketu, the wrestler-hero (Malla), he founded a city in the land
  of the Mallas; it became renowned as Candrakānta, a divine city like unto a
  city of heaven.
'10': >-
  Thereupon Rāma attained supreme gladness, and so too did Lakṣmaṇa and Bharata;
  unconquerable in battle, they then performed the consecration (abhiṣeka).
'11': >-
  After consecrating the two princes, Rāghava sent them forth—Aṅgada towards the
  western region, and Candraketu facing north (to the northern quarter).
'12': >-
  And Saumitrī Lakṣmaṇa accompanied Aṅgada as well; but for Candraketu, Bharata
  became his close attendant and supporter (one who follows at the heels).
'13': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa dwelt in Aṅgadīyā for a year; and when the son (Aṅgada) was
  firmly established, unconquerable, he returned again to Ayodhyā.
'14': >-
  Bharata likewise, having dwelt (there) for a year and more, returned again to
  Ayodhyā and attended upon Rāma’s feet (serving him in devotion).
'15': >-
  Both Saumitrī and Bharata, faithful in their observance towards Rāma’s feet,
  did not, out of affection, even perceive the passage of time—those two
  exceedingly righteous ones.
'16': >-
  Thus, at that time, ten thousand years passed for them, ever striving in
  dharma and continually engaged in the affairs and duties of the citizens.
'17': >-
  Passing their time with hearts fully content, established well in the City of
  Dharma (Ayodhyā), encompassed with prosperity—those three, blazing with
  splendour, shone like three fires well-kindled and duly fed with oblations in
  a great sacrifice.
'18': >-
  Thus ends the two-hundred-and-second sarga of the Uttarakāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Founding (Settlement) of Aṅgada
  and Candraketu.”
