  Now, in the sacred, illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins
  the ninety-eighth chapter, entitled “The Search for Rāma.”
'1': >-
  Having stationed the army, that mighty lord—best among those who go on
  foot—resolved to go to the son of Kakutstha (Rāma) on foot himself, in a
  manner becoming one who follows the elders’ command.
'2': >-
  As soon as the army had been settled in their respective places in disciplined
  order, Bharata spoke these words to his brother Śatrughna.
'3': >-
  Quickly, O gentle one, you should search this forest on every side, together
  with these throngs of men, and with these hunters as well.
'4': >-
  Let Guha, surrounded by a thousand of his kinsmen bearing arrows, bows, and
  swords, thoroughly search this region for the son of Kakutstha.
'5': >-
  And I myself, accompanied by ministers and citizens, and by elders and
  twice-born brāhmaṇas, will traverse the entire forest on foot, surrounded by
  attendants.
'6': >-
  So long as I do not behold Rāma, or Lakṣmaṇa of great strength, or the highly
  fortunate Vaidehī (Sītā), I shall have no peace.
'7': >-
  So long as I do not behold the auspicious-faced one, radiant like the moon—my
  brother, lotus-leaf–eyed—there will be no peace for me.
'8': >-
  So long as I do not bear upon my head my brother’s two feet, adorned with the
  marks of sovereignty, I shall have no peace.
'9': >-
  So long as the rightful heir to the kingdom is not established in the realm,
  in the lineage of his father and forefathers, his consecration-water still wet
  upon him, I shall have no peace.
'10': >-
  Surely Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) is of accomplished purpose, for he beholds the
  lotus-eyed, greatly radiant face of Rāma, pure like the spotless moon.
'11': >-
  Blessed indeed, her purpose fulfilled, is Vaidehī, Janaka’s daughter, who
  follows her husband—the lord of the earth bounded by the ocean.
'12': >-
  Auspicious is that Citrakūṭa—mountain like unto the king of mountains—where
  the son of Kakutstha dwells, like Kubera in Nandana-grove.
'13': >-
  This difficult forest, frequented by wild beasts, has had its purpose
  fulfilled, in that Rāma of great splendor—best among bearers of weapons—dwells
  in it.
'14': >-
  Thus speaking, the great-souled Bharata, a bull among men, that mighty-armed
  one, entered the vast forest on foot alone.
'15': >-
  Moving through the midst of those clusters of trees that grew upon the
  mountain-slopes, with their tops in bloom, that best of speakers proceeded
  onward.
'16': >-
  Because of the nearness (of the place), the sight of its very root came into
  view—therefore this needs no repetition (further description).
'17': >-
  Seeing it, the illustrious Bharata, together with his kinsmen, was overcome
  and swooned; knowing, “Here is Rāma,” he was as one who has reached the
  farther shore, as it were, of a flood.
'18': >-
  Then, having heard upon Mount Citrakūṭa of Rāma’s hermitage—hallowed and
  frequented by holy beings—Bharata, the great-souled one, after again
  stationing the army, quickly went there together with Guha.
'19': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-eighth chapter, entitled “The Search for Rāma,” in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Primeval Epic.
