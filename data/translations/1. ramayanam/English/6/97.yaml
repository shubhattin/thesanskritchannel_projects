  Now begins the ninety-seventh canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Slaying of Virūpākṣa.”
'1': >-
  Then, by those shafts of Daśagrīva, severing limbs as they struck, the earth
  there became strewn everywhere with monkeys, their bodies scattered about.
'2': >-
  That intolerable, blazing storm of arrows of Rāvaṇa, coming all at once, they
  were not able to endure—just as moths cannot endure a fire.
'3': >-
  Tormented by sharp arrows, crying out aloud, they fled in confusion—like
  elephants, engulfed by tongues of flame, burning as they run.
'4': >-
  In that battle, Rāvaṇa, smiting with arrows, swept through the divisions of
  the monkeys like the wind drives and breaks apart great masses of clouds.
'5': >-
  Having wrought a fierce slaughter among the forest-dwellers with great speed,
  the lord of rākṣasas then swiftly closed in, in battle, upon Rāghava on the
  field.
'6': >-
  Sugrīva, seeing those monkeys broken and driven back in the fight, placed
  Suṣeṇa in command of a troop, and quickly set his mind upon battle.
'7': >-
  Setting in that place a heroic monkey, his equal in prowess, Sugrīva advanced
  straight toward the foe, with trees for weapons.
'8': >-
  At his side and behind him, all the monkey-chieftains followed, bearing great
  rocks and various trees of the forest.
'9': >-
  In the battle Sugrīva, the mighty one, roared with a great voice, striking
  down many others and crushing the foremost rākṣasas.
'10': >-
  The great-bodied lord of monkeys ground down the rākṣasas, like the wind at
  the end of an age uproots and shatters fully grown trees.
'11': >-
  Into the ranks of the rākṣasas he poured a rain of rocks—like a cloud raining
  down hailstones upon flocks of birds in a wood.
'12': >-
  By those showers of rocks hurled forth by the monkey-king, the rākṣasas fell
  with their heads shattered, scattered like fragments of mountains.
'13': >-
  Then, as the rākṣasas were being diminished on every side—broken by
  Sugrīva—while some roared and others fell,
'14': >-
  Virūpākṣa, the rākṣasa archer, proclaiming his own name, leapt down from his
  chariot; hard to assail, he mounted the shoulder of an elephant.
'15': >-
  Ascending that elephant, mighty Virūpākṣa let out a dreadful, terrifying roar
  and charged straight at the monkeys.
'16': >-
  At the forefront of the army he hurled fearful arrows at Sugrīva, steadying
  the rākṣasas who were shaken and gladdening them with renewed courage.
'17': >-
  Pierced deeply by sharp arrows by that rākṣasa, the lord of monkeys cried out
  in great wrath, and set his mind upon slaying him.
'18': >-
  Then the heroic monkey, eager for close combat, tore up a tree, sprang
  forward, and struck that great elephant on the front.
'19': >-
  Smitten by Sugrīva’s blow, the great elephant backed away by the length of a
  bow, then sank down and trumpeted aloud.
'20': >-
  But that valorous rākṣasa, swiftly withdrawing from the staggered elephant,
  came forward to meet the foe, advancing then toward that monkey.
'21': >-
  Taking up a bull-hide shield and a sword, swift in onset, he approached
  Sugrīva who stood firm, as though reviling and threatening him.
'22': >-
  Enraged against him, Sugrīva seized a huge rock, resembling a cloud, and
  hurled it at Virūpākṣa.
'23': >-
  Seeing that rock rushing toward him, the foremost of rākṣasas stepped aside
  with great agility and struck it then with his sword.
'24': >-
  By that sword-stroke of the mighty rākṣasa, the monkey was struck down and for
  a moment lay upon the ground as if unconscious.
'25': >-
  Suddenly leaping up then, in that great combat, he clenched his fist and with
  speed drove it down upon the rākṣasa’s chest.
'26': >-
  Virūpākṣa the night-ranger, struck by the blow of Sugrīva’s fist, became
  furious; and with that sword he raged against Sugrīva at the head of the host.
'27': >-
  He caused Sugrīva’s armor to fall away; and Sugrīva, struck, fell. Rising
  again after falling, the monkey let fly his attack upon him.
'28': >-
  Then Sugrīva raised a palm-strike—like a thunderbolt, dreadful in
  sound—lifting up that terrible blow against the rākṣasa.
'29': >-
  But with skill he avoided that blow, and struck him on the chest with his
  fists. Thereupon Sugrīva, the lord of monkeys, became still more enraged.
'30': >-
  Seeing his own blow thus foiled by that rākṣasa, the monkey perceived an
  opening in Virūpākṣa.
'31': >-
  Then in wrath he brought down another mighty palm-blow upon the region of the
  temple, like Indra’s thunderbolt; struck by that palm, he crashed to the
  earth.
'32': >-
  He fell drenched in blood, indeed vomiting forth gore; from his channels
  Virūpākṣa poured blood like water from a mountainside spring.
'33': >-
  With eyes rolled upward in anger, with foam, and bathed in blood, Virūpākṣa
  was seen by them made even more hideous than his name implies.
'34': >-
  Twitching and writhing, his side drenched with blood, lamentably moaning and
  crying out, the monkeys beheld their foe.
'35': >-
  Thus those two, fiercely joined in the fight—the mighty champions of monkeys
  and rākṣasas—like two vast oceans, thundered with dreadful sound, like two
  great seas whose dikes have been broken.
'36': >-
  Beholding that great and mighty one, Virūpākṣa, his terrible eye destroyed by
  the monkey-king, the assembled host of monkeys and rākṣasas became like the
  Gaṅgā in spate, its waters upheaved and overflowing.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-seventh canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Slaying of Virūpākṣa.”
