'0': >-
  Now, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Ayodhya-kanda, the seventeenth
  canto, called “Rama’s Arrival.”
'1': >-
  That Rama, his heart delighted and his well-wishers rejoicing, mounted the
  chariot and set forth, (the way) adorned with banners and standards, and
  perfumed with exceedingly costly aloes-wood incense.
'2': >-
  The illustrious prince beheld the city, thronged with people of many kinds,
  and beautified by houses white and pale, gleaming like clouds.
'3': >-
  Rama proceeded along the royal highway through the midst (of the city), made
  fragrant with aloes-wood incense, by heaps and stores of sandalwood—especially
  the choicest—and of aloes-wood as well.
'4': >-
  (The road was graced) with the finest perfumes, with linen and silken cloth;
  and with unpierced pearls, and with excellent crystals too.
'5': >-
  He saw that splendid, unconstricted, most excellent royal road, strewn and
  covered with diverse flowers, and also with foods and edibles of various
  kinds.
'6': >-
  He beheld that royal highway as though it were the path of the lord of the
  Devas in heaven—strewn with curds, unbroken rice, oblations, parched grain,
  and with incense of aloes-wood and sandal.
'7': >-
  Its squares and crossings were ever worshipfully honored with fragrances and
  garlands of many sorts; and he heard many blessings uttered by his friends and
  well-wishers.
'8': >-
  And having duly honored all those men according to their worth, he proceeded
  along that very road which had been followed in practice by grandfathers and
  by great-grandfathers before them.
'9': >-
  “Today, having taken up that path, once he is consecrated, may he protect (the
  kingdom) in the same manner as we were nurtured by our father, and as by all
  our forefathers; then shall we all live more happily under King Rama.”
'10': >-
  “Enough for us today of enjoyment, and enough even of the highest gains, if
  only we may behold Rama going forth, established upon the throne.”
'11': >-
  “For then, nothing else whatsoever will be dearer to us than the consecration
  of Rama—of immeasurable splendor—together with the sovereignty.”
'12': >-
  Hearing these and other auspicious words of friends and even of those who
  stood neutral—words worthy to be received as honor to himself—Rama went along
  the great highway.
'13': >-
  For no man is able to draw away his mind or even his eyes from that best of
  men—Raghava—though he has already passed onward.
'14': >-
  And he who does not see Rama, and whom Rama does not see—he is blamed in all
  the worlds, and even his own self condemns him.
'15': >-
  For that righteous-souled one shows compassion to all the social orders; and
  because he is (kind) to the four stages of life, they all follow his vow and
  align themselves with him.
'16': >-
  Going along, the king’s son reverently circumambulated—keeping them to his
  right—crossroads, the paths of the gods, sacred shrines (caityas), and holy
  sanctuaries.
'17': >-
  Then, approaching the royal residence, (adorned) with auspicious palace-peaks
  like masses of clouds, and with many kinds of lofty towers resembling the
  summit of Kailasa,
'18': >-
  with white mansions like aerial cars that seemed to obstruct the sky, and with
  ever-growing edifices, beautified with lattices and networks of jewels,
'19': >-
  that prince—shining with splendor—entered his father’s palace, the best of
  dwellings upon earth, like unto the abode of Mahendra (Indra).
'20': >-
  Passing beyond three guarded enclosures protected by archers and by horsemen,
  the best of men went on foot through two further inner courts.
'21': >-
  Having crossed all the enclosures, Dasharatha’s son, turning back and
  dismissing all the people, entered the pure inner apartments.
'22': >-
  When at that time he had entered near his father, all the people—gladdened in
  the king’s son—waited again for his re-emergence, even as the lord of rivers
  waits for the moon’s rising.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the seventeenth canto, called “Rama’s Arrival,” in the Ayodhya-kanda
  of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the Primeval Epic.
