'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (Paramātman).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': 'Now, the Ninth Chapter: The Yoga of Royal Knowledge and Royal Secret.'
'3': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'4': >-
  This, indeed—the most secret of all—I shall declare to you who are free from
  fault-finding: knowledge together with realized understanding (vijñāna);
  knowing which, you shall be liberated from inauspiciousness.
'5': >-
  This is the royal knowledge, the royal secret—most pure and supreme; directly
  realizable, in accordance with dharma, very easy to practice, and
  imperishable.
'6': >-
  Men who have no faith in this dharma, O scorcher of foes, not attaining Me,
  return again on the path of death and transmigratory existence.
'7': >-
  By Me this entire universe is pervaded in an unmanifest form; all beings abide
  in Me, yet I do not abide in them.
'8': >-
  And yet beings do not truly abide in Me—behold My sovereign Yoga: My Self, the
  sustainer of beings and the bringer forth of beings, is not established in the
  beings.
'9': >-
  As the mighty wind, ever moving everywhere, abides in space—so too know that
  all beings abide in Me.
'10': >-
  All beings, O son of Kuntī, enter into My Prakṛti at the end of a cycle
  (kalpa); and again, at the beginning of a cycle, I send them forth.
'11': >-
  Taking hold of My own Prakṛti, I project again and again this entire multitude
  of beings—helpless, by the force of Prakṛti.
'12': >-
  And those actions do not bind Me, O Dhanañjaya; I remain as one indifferent,
  unattached to those actions.
'13': >-
  With Me as the overseer, Prakṛti brings forth the moving and the unmoving;
  because of this cause, O son of Kuntī, the world revolves.
'14': >-
  Deluded persons disregard Me, who have assumed a human body—not knowing My
  higher nature as the great Lord of all beings.
'15': >-
  Of vain hopes, vain actions, and vain knowledge—bereft of discernment—they
  resort to the delusive nature that is demoniac and rākṣasic.
'16': >-
  But the great-souled ones, O Pārtha, resorting to the divine nature, worship
  Me with undivided mind, knowing Me as the imperishable origin of all beings.
'17': >-
  Ever chanting My glory, striving with firm vows, and bowing to Me with
  devotion—they worship Me, ever steadfast in union.
'18': >-
  Others too, offering worship by the sacrifice of knowledge, adore Me—seeing Me
  as one, as distinct, and as manifold; as the Universal-Faced.
'19': >-
  I am the rite (kratu); I am the sacrifice (yajña); I am the offering to
  ancestors (svadhā); I am the herb; I am the mantra; I alone am the clarified
  butter (ājya); I am the fire; I am the oblation.
'20': >-
  I am the Father of this world, the Mother, the Sustainer, and the Grandsire; I
  am the object of knowledge, the purifier, and the syllable Oṃ; and also Ṛk,
  Sāma, and Yajus (the Vedas).
'21': >-
  I am the goal, the supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the refuge,
  and the friend; the source and the dissolution, the ground, the
  treasure-house, and the imperishable seed.
'22': >-
  I give heat; I withhold and I send forth the rain; I am immortality, and I am
  death; I am being and non-being as well, O Arjuna.
'23': >-
  The knowers of the three Vedas, drinkers of Soma, purified of sins,
  worshipping Me through sacrifices, pray for passage to heaven. They, attaining
  the meritorious world of Indra, enjoy in heaven the divine enjoyments of the
  gods.
'24': >-
  Having enjoyed that vast heavenly world, when their merit is exhausted they
  enter the world of mortals. Thus, those who follow the dharma enjoined by the
  three Vedas—desiring enjoyments—obtain the coming and going (repeated return).
'25': >-
  But those persons who, thinking of Me with no other thought, worship Me on
  every side—of those ever steadfast, I bear the burden of their attainment and
  their preservation (yoga and kṣema).
'26': >-
  Even those who, endowed with faith, are devoted to other deities and worship
  them—they too, O son of Kuntī, worship Me alone, though not in the prescribed
  manner.
'27': >-
  For I indeed am the enjoyer and the Lord of all sacrifices; but they do not
  know Me in truth—therefore they fall away.
'28': >-
  Votaries of the gods go to the gods; votaries of the ancestors go to the
  ancestors; worshippers of beings go to the beings; and those who sacrifice to
  Me come to Me.
'29': >-
  Whoever offers to Me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water—that
  offering, brought by devotion, I partake of, from the self-controlled.
'30': >-
  Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever
  you give, and whatever austerity you perform—O son of Kuntī, do that as an
  offering unto Me.
'31': >-
  Thus you shall be freed from the bonds of actions, yielding auspicious and
  inauspicious fruits; with the mind united in the Yoga of renunciation,
  liberated, you shall come to Me.
'32': >-
  I am equal toward all beings; to Me there is none hateful and none dear. But
  those who worship Me with devotion—they are in Me, and I too am in them.
'33': >-
  Even if one of very evil conduct worships Me with exclusive devotion, he is to
  be regarded as righteous indeed—for he has rightly resolved.
'34': >-
  Quickly he becomes a dharmic soul and attains enduring peace. O son of Kuntī,
  know it for certain: My devotee never perishes.
'35': >-
  For taking refuge in Me, O Pārtha—even those who are of sinful birth—women,
  vaiśyas, and śūdras—they too attain the supreme goal.
'36': >-
  How much more, then, holy brāhmaṇas and devoted royal sages! Having come to
  this impermanent and joyless world, worship Me.
'37': >-
  Fix your mind on Me; be My devotee; sacrifice to Me; bow down to Me. Thus,
  joining yourself (yourself disciplined) and regarding Me as the supreme
  refuge, you shall come to Me alone.
'38': >-
  Om Tat Sat—thus, in the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, among the Upaniṣads, in the
  science of Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue between Śrī
  Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, ends the Ninth Chapter, entitled “The Yoga of Royal
  Knowledge and Royal Secret.”
