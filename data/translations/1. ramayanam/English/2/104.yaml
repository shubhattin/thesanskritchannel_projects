  Now begins, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, the one
  hundred and fourth sarga, called “The Dialogue between Rāma and Bharata.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, knowing him to be his brother—one devoted to his preceptors—began,
  along with his brother Lakṣmaṇa, to question Bharata.
'2': >-
  “What is this that I wish to hear, uttered by you? For what reason have you
  come to this region wearing bark garments, matted hair, and an antelope-skin?”
'3': >-
  “For what cause have you entered this land, bearing matted locks and a black
  antelope-skin, having abandoned the kingdom? All that you ought to tell me.”
'4': >-
  Thus addressed by the great-souled Kakutstha (Rāma), Kaikeyī’s son (Bharata),
  grasping himself firmly once more, with palms joined in reverence, spoke these
  words:
'5': >-
  “Your noble father, having forsaken (his body), after performing a deed most
  hard to do, has gone to heaven—he, the mighty-armed one, oppressed by grief
  for his son.”
'6': >-
  “Compelled by a woman—by Kaikeyī, my mother—O scorcher of foes, he committed
  this exceedingly great sin, one that takes away his own fame.”
'7': >-
  “She, having not obtained the fruit of sovereignty, widowed and wasted by
  sorrow, will fall, my mother, into a most dreadful hell.”
'8': >-
  “Therefore you ought to show favour to me, who have become as one enslaved. Do
  you be consecrated this very day with the kingdom, like Maghavān (Indra).”
'9': >-
  “All these citizens and ministers, and those mothers who are widows, who have
  come into your presence—you ought to show them favour.”
'10': >-
  “Then, in due order, and in a manner proper and fitting for yourself, O
  bestower of honour, obtain the kingdom through dharma, and fulfil the desires
  of your well-wishers.”
'11': >-
  “Let the entire earth become non-widowed, having you as her lord—like an
  autumn night made beautiful by the spotless moon.”
'12': >-
  “And along with these counsellors, having bowed my head, I beg you: you ought
  to grant favour to your brother—your disciple and your servant.”
'13': >-
  “This whole ancestral, everlasting realm, together with the circle of its
  subjects, O tiger among men, honoured as it is, you ought not to transgress
  (by refusing it).”
'14': >-
  Having spoken thus, the mighty-armed son of Kaikeyī, with tears, again, in due
  form, took hold of Rāma’s feet with his head (bowing low).
'15': >-
  Rāma embraced his brother Bharata, who, like an intoxicated elephant, was
  again and again heaving deep sighs, and spoke these words:
'16': >-
  “A man such as you—high-born, endowed with virtue, radiant, and steadfast in
  righteous conduct—how could he commit sin for the sake of a kingdom?”
'17': >-
  “I see not even the slightest fault in you, O destroyer of foes; and you ought
  not, from childhood onward, to censure your mother either.”
'18': >-
  “The power of acting according to one’s desire, O greatly wise and sinless
  one, in regard to gurus, comes into play in matters connected with wives who
  are duly wedded and with sons.”
'19': >-
  “How we are spoken of in this world, dear one, by the good and the virtuous—as
  wives, as sons, and as disciples—this you ought to understand (and approve).”
'20': >-
  “Whether in the forest, clad in bark garments, dear one, wearing the black
  antelope-skin; or even in the kingdom—the great king (our father) had the
  authority to have me dwell (where he commanded).”
'21': >-
  “So long as, with regard to my father—the knower of dharma—there is reverence
  honoured by the world, so long, O best of uphold­ers of dharma, there must be
  reverence for my mother as well.”
'22': >-
  “‘Go to the forest,’—so was I commanded by those two, my mother and father,
  both devoted to dharma, O Rāghava. How could I act otherwise?”
'23': >-
  “By you the kingdom in Ayodhyā, honoured by the world, is to be obtained; by
  me, clad in bark garments, the Daṇḍaka forest is to be inhabited.”
'24': >-
  “Having thus made the division in the presence of the people, the great and
  mighty king Daśaratha, after issuing his decree, went to heaven.”
'25': >-
  “And that righteous king—your father, the guru of the world—serves as the
  authority; the portion given by your father, as your share, you ought to
  enjoy.”
'26': >-
  “For fourteen years, dear one, dwelling in the Daṇḍaka forest, I shall enjoy
  the portion that was given by my great-souled father.”
'27': >-
  “Whatever my father—honoured in the world of men, great-souled, comparable to
  the lord of the gods—said to me, that alone I deem to be the highest good for
  my own self, and not even the state of being lord of the entire world.”
'28': >-
  Thus ends, in the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the first of poems, in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, the one hundred and fourth sarga, called “The Dialogue between
  Rāma and Bharata.”
