  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyākāṇḍa, begins the
  eighty-fifth chapter, entitled “The Meeting with Guha.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed, Bharata—of great wisdom—replied to Guha, the lord of the
  Niṣādas, with words well furnished with reason and purpose.
'2': >-
  O friend of my preceptor, thy desire indeed is lofty and noble—yet it has been
  fulfilled by me—inasmuch as thou, alone, wishest to honour and entertain this
  great army of mine.
'3': >-
  Having thus spoken that excellent speech to Guha, the illustrious Bharata, of
  mighty splendour, again addressed the chieftain of the Niṣādas.
'4': >-
  By which way, O Guha, shall I go to Bharadvāja’s hermitage? This region is
  exceedingly difficult—dense and pathless; and the tract by the Gaṅgā’s marshy
  banks is hard to pass.
'5': >-
  Hearing those words of the wise prince, Guha—who was wont to move amid dense
  wilds—spoke with joined palms.
'6': >-
  Well-ordered boatmen, bearing bows, shall follow thee; and I also shall
  accompany thee, O highly renowned prince.
'7': >-
  Art thou not going with an evil intent against Rāma of unwearied deeds? This
  great army of thine seems, to me, as though it would raise suspicion.
'8': >-
  Thus addressed by him, Bharata—pure as the clear sky—replied to Guha in gentle
  and polished speech.
'9': >-
  May that time never come when thou shouldst have cause to suspect me! For that
  Rāghava is my elder brother—unto me even as my father.
'10': >-
  I go to turn back the Kakutstha dwelling in the forest. Entertain no other
  thought, O Guha; I tell thee the truth.
'11': >-
  Then Guha, his face bright with joy, hearing Bharata’s words, again spoke to
  Bharata, rejoicing.
'12': >-
  Blessed art thou! I behold none on the face of the earth equal unto thee—thou
  who desirest here to renounce the kingdom that has come to thee without
  effort.
'13': >-
  Verily thy fame shall follow thee through all the worlds, since thou desirest
  to bring back Rāma, who has gone into hardship.
'14': >-
  While Guha thus conversed with Bharata, the sun’s splendour faded, and night
  drew on.
'15': >-
  Having encamped that army, and being well satisfied by Guha, the illustrious
  Bharata, together with Śatrughna, returned again to his resting-place.
'16': >-
  In that great-souled Bharata, sorrow wholly made of thought of Rāma had
  arisen—such sorrow as was unbefitting one who looked ever to righteousness.
'17': >-
  That hidden burning, like a concealed fire scorching a tree that has been
  heated by a forest-conflagration, consumed the Rāghava inwardly and tormented
  him.
'18': >-
  From all his limbs sweat, born of the fire of grief, streamed forth—like the
  Himālaya, heated by the sun’s rays, letting its snows melt and flow away.
'19': >-
  With its slopes of meditation, its minerals of long, drawn-out sighs, its
  thickets of trees of dejection, and its lofty peaks of grief and weariness—
'20': >-
  —with bamboos of herbs that are scorching anguish, and with endless creatures
  of bewilderment—thus was Kaikeyī’s son overborne by a vast mountain of sorrow.
'21': >-
  Sighing deeply, exceedingly downcast, his senses confounded, having reached
  the extremity of distress—tormented by the fever of his heart—he found no
  peace, like a bull, the lord of the herd, when struck down by the herd itself.
'22': >-
  Bharata, of mighty influence, having met with Guha, together with his people,
  calm and self-controlled—then Guha again sought to console that Bharata, so
  sorely distressed, regarding the elder brother.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-fifth chapter of the Ayodhyākāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Meeting with Guha.”
