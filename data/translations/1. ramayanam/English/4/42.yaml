  Now, in the holy, illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, begins
  the forty-second chapter, named “The Dispatch to the Western Quarter.”
'1': >-
  Then Sugrīva, having sent forth the monkeys toward the southern direction,
  spoke to a monkey named Suṣeṇa, whose splendour was like a rain-cloud.
'2': >-
  The king—approaching him, joining his palms, and bowing down—addressed Suṣeṇa,
  the father of Tārā, his father-in-law, of dreadful prowess, with these words.
'3': >-
  (He addressed) Mārīca, the son of a great seer—radiant, a mighty
  monkey—surrounded by excellent and valiant monkey-chiefs, resplendent like
  Mahendra (Indra).
'4': >-
  Endowed with intelligence and valour, shining like Vainateya (Garuḍa), (and)
  the sons of Mārīca—Mārīcas, Arciṣ, Mālyān—mighty in strength;
'5': >-
  And all those sons of ṛṣis—O foremost of monkeys—he directed toward the
  western quarter, in a force of two hundred thousand monkeys.
'6': >-
  “You, with Suṣeṇa at your head, search for Vaidehī. Search Saurāṣṭra together
  with Bāhlīka, and the regions adorned with moonlike and wondrous sights as
  well.
'7': >-
  (Search) prosperous and delightful countries, and broad and ancient cities;
  valleys thick with puṃnāga-groves, crowded with bakula and uddālaka trees;
'8': >-
  And also thickets of ketaka—search them, O best of monkeys. (Search) rivers
  too that flow westward, with cool waters, auspicious and pleasant.
'9': >-
  (Search) the forest-hermitages of ascetics, and the wilds and mountains there;
  and uplands that are mostly desert-like, and rocks that are exceedingly high
  and chill.
'10': >-
  Having searched that western quarter—difficult, covered with ranges of
  mountains—then, going yet further west, you ought to behold the ocean.
'11': >-
  Reaching that sea whose waters are thronged with timi-fish and makaras, you
  shall see it, O monkeys. Then, among ketaka-thickets and in dense
  tamāla-groves,
'12': >-
  The monkeys will roam, and in coconut-groves as well. There search for
  Sītā—and also for the abode of Rāvaṇa.
'13': >-
  (Search) in the mountains set upon the seashore and in the forests; and
  (visit) the city called Muravī, and the lovely Jatāpura.
'14': >-
  (Search) Avantī and Aṅgalepa, and likewise the forest that is hard to discern;
  and vast kingdoms, and cities here and there.
'15': >-
  And at the confluence of the Sindhu and the ocean there is a great mountain
  named Somagiri, having a hundred peaks and mighty trees.
'16': >-
  On its delightful plateaus lions dwell—moving as if they were birds—and they
  set up nests for timi-fish, fish, and even elephants.
'17': >-
  Those nests of the lions that are upon the mountain-peaks, and the rutting
  elephants there—proud and satisfied, rumbling like thunderclouds—
'18': >-
  Roam all about on that vast mountain, full of waters on every side. Its peak,
  touching the sky, is golden, with wondrous trees.
'19': >-
  All this is to be swiftly and thoroughly explored by the monkeys, who can
  assume forms at will. There is also a golden coast of the sea, extending a
  hundred yojanas.
'20': >-
  Passing beyond, you shall behold, O monkeys, the difficult-to-see (region) of
  Pāriyātra. There dwell twenty-four crores of mighty Gandharvas,
'21': >-
  Terrible, able to assume forms at will, with the lustre of fire, assembled on
  all sides, resembling tongues of flame.
'22': >-
  They must not be approached too closely by the monkeys of dreadful prowess;
  and from that land no fruit at all is to be taken by the monkeys.
'23': >-
  For those heroes are hard to assail—endowed with vigour and of great
  strength—and they fiercely guard the fruits and roots there.
'24': >-
  Yet effort must be made there, and Jānakī must be sought; for there is no fear
  from them for those who maintain their monkey-nature (i.e., keep to their own
  proper course).
'25': >-
  There stands the great mountain named Vajra—having the hue of vaidūrya
  (cat’s-eye gem), formed as though of adamant, filled with diverse trees and
  creepers.
'26': >-
  Glorious, it rises there to an even hundred yojanas. The caves there must be
  explored with great diligence, O monkeys.
'27': >-
  In the fourth division of the sea there is a mountain named Cakravat. There a
  thousand-spoked discus was fashioned by Viśvakarman.
'28': >-
  There, having slain Pañcajana and the demon Hayagrīva, the Supreme Person
  carried away that discus and also the conch.
'29': >-
  Upon its lovely slopes and within its vast caves, Rāvaṇa together with Vaidehī
  is to be searched for, again and again, in every place.
'30': >-
  At a distance of sixty-four yojanas lies the mountain named Varāha, with
  golden peaks—very great—standing in the unfathomable abode of Varuṇa (the
  sea).
'31': >-
  There is a city named Prāgjyotiṣa, made of gold, in which dwells the
  wicked-souled demon named Naraka.
'32': >-
  Upon its lovely slopes and within its vast caves, Rāvaṇa together with Vaidehī
  is to be searched for, again and again, in every place.
'33': >-
  Passing beyond that lord of mountains, whose inner aspects are seen as golden,
  there is a mountain all of gold, with many cascades and streams.
'34': >-
  On all sides elephants, boars, lions, and tigers continually roar upon it—made
  arrogant by that very sound.
'35': >-
  That mountain is called Megha, on which the illustrious lord of the gods,
  Indra—rider of the elephant Harihayā, chastiser of Pāka—was consecrated as
  king by the gods.
'36': >-
  Crossing beyond that king of mountains, guarded by Mahendra (Indra), you shall
  go to sixty thousand golden mountains.
'37': >-
  Shining everywhere with the colour of the young sun, adorned with trees of
  gold, beautiful and in full blossom.
'38': >-
  In their midst stands King Meru, the highest of mountains. Formerly that
  mountain was granted a boon by the serene Sun.
'39': >-
  “Thus addressed, this king of mountains—since all are under thy
  protection—shall, by my grace, become golden by day and by night.
'40': >-
  And those Devas, Gandharvas, and Dānavas who dwell upon thee shall become
  devoted, and by their radiance shall be of golden splendour.”
'41': >-
  There the Viśvedevas, the Vasus, and the Maruts—celestial dwellers—come at the
  western twilight to Meru, the excellent mountain,
'42': >-
  And they worship the Sun; honoured by them, the Sun—becoming unseen to all
  beings—goes to his setting upon the mountain.
'43': >-
  The maker of day (the Sun), traversing ten thousand yojanas, quickly reaches
  that rocky height in half a muhūrta.
'44': >-
  On its summit there is a great, divine mansion, resembling the Sun, crowded
  with clusters of palaces, fashioned by Viśvakarman.
'45': >-
  Adorned with wondrous trees and thronged with many kinds of birds—this is the
  dwelling of the great-souled Varuṇa, who bears the noose in his hand.
'46': >-
  Between Meru and the mountain of setting stands a great palmyra, ten-headed,
  made of gold and splendid, with marvellous platforms.
'47': >-
  In all those difficult places, and in lakes and rivers as well, Rāvaṇa
  together with Vaidehī is to be searched for, again and again, in every place.
'48': >-
  There dwells one who knows dharma, matured by his own austerities—this sage is
  famed as Merusāvarṇi, equal to Brahmā.
'49': >-
  That great seer Merusāvarṇi, radiant like the Sun, should be questioned—after
  bowing with the head to the ground—regarding tidings of Maithilī.
'50': >-
  So far does the Sun, at the end of night, illumine the world; having made
  everything free of darkness, he goes to set upon the mountain.
'51': >-
  So far, O foremost of monkeys, is it possible for monkeys to go; beyond that,
  in the sunless and unbounded region, we do not know what lies further.
'52': >-
  Having ascertained Vaidehī and also Rāvaṇa’s abode, reach the mountain of
  setting and return when the month is complete.
'53': >-
  Do not remain beyond a month; if any stays, he shall be liable to death by me.
  Along with you my father-in-law, the hero, shall go.
'54': >-
  All this is to be hearkened to and carried out by you, who perform what is
  enjoined. This mighty-armed, mighty father-in-law of mine is your preceptor.
'55': >-
  You too are valiant—indeed all of you are competent. Establishing him as your
  authority, go and search the western direction.
'56': >-
  When the wife of the king of immeasurable splendour is seen, we shall have
  achieved our purpose—having rendered due recompense for what has been done
  (for us).
'57': >-
  And whatever further task should be done that may be beneficial to this
  undertaking—having deliberated, you must act in a manner suited to place,
  time, and purpose.
'58': >-
  Then the monkeys, with Suṣeṇa at their head—having carefully heard Sugrīva’s
  prudent words—took leave of the lord of monkeys and went to that quarter
  protected by Varuṇa.
'59': >-
  Thus ends the forty-second chapter, named “The Dispatch to the Western
  Quarter,” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primordial epic.
