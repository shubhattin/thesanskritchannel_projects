  Now, in the blessed Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-eighth sarga, named “The Lamentation of the Women of the City.”
'1': >-
  Thus, those people—utterly distressed and sorely afflicted—having eyes flooded
  with tears, sorrowful and as though near to death, remained overwhelmed.
'2': >-
  When the city-dwellers had followed Rāma and then turned back, the hearts of
  those bereft of composure were as though their very vital spirits had gone
  forth.
'3': >-
  Returning each to his own dwelling, surrounded by sons and wives, all of them
  let fall tears, their faces covered and obscured by weeping.
'4': >-
  They neither rejoiced nor took delight; the merchants did not set forth their
  trade; wares did not appear splendid, and householders did not cook.
'5': >-
  Seeing gain lost, none felt glad; nor did anyone exult at the coming of
  abundant wealth. Even a mother, having obtained her first-born son, did not
  rejoice.
'6': >-
  In house after house, the women, weeping, reproached their husbands when they
  returned home—distressed with grief—stinging them with words, as if goading
  elephants with pointed prods.
'7': >-
  “What need have we of houses? What of husbands? What of wealth? What even of
  sons, or of pleasures—if we do not behold Rāghava?”
'8': >-
  “In this world there is but one true man—Lakṣmaṇa, together with Sītā—who
  follows Kakutstha Rāma and serves him in the forest.”
'9': >-
  “Blessed indeed are those rivers, those lotus-filled lakes and pools, into
  which Kakutstha will bathe—entering the pure waters.”
'10': >-
  “Lovely woodlands will adorn Kakutstha as he roams; and so too the rivers with
  broad marshy banks, and the mountains with their slopes.”
'11': >-
  “Whether it be a forest or a mountain which Rāma approaches—none will be able
  to leave him unhonoured, like a beloved guest arrived.”
'12': >-
  “Wearing garlands of varied blossoms, bearing many clusters of flowers—those
  trees will offer, even out of season, choice flowers and fruits.”
'13': >-
  “Even out of season, the mountains, out of compassion, will show choice
  flowers and fruits to Rāma when he arrives.”
'14': >-
  “The mountains will cause pure waters to flow forth, displaying again and
  again their many wondrous waterfalls and cascades.”
'15': >-
  “The trees upon the mountain-peaks will delight Rāghava. Where Rāma is, there
  is no fear; and where there is no fear, there is no defeat.”
'16': >-
  “For he is a hero, mighty-armed, the son of Daśaratha. Come—let us not remain
  far away; let us follow Rāghava.”
'17': >-
  “The shade of the feet of such a great-souled lord is sweet indeed. He is the
  protector of this people; he is their refuge, their highest recourse.”
'18': >-
  “We shall attend upon Sītā, and you—upon Rāghava!” Thus did the women of the
  city, afflicted with sorrow, say this and that to their husbands.
'19': >-
  “In the forest, Rāghava will provide for your welfare and security; and Sītā
  will ensure the welfare and safety of the womenfolk of this people.”
'20': >-
  “Who could find pleasure in this unpleasing mode of living, with a mind stolen
  away—when one’s loved one is not near, and the people yearn in anguish?”
'21': >-
  “If by Kaikeyī’s doing the kingdom should become unrighteous, like one without
  a lord, then life itself is of no use to us—what then of sons, what of
  wealth?”
'22': >-
  “She by whom both son and husband have been cast away for the sake of
  sovereignty—whom else would that Kaikeyī, the dust and disgrace of her
  lineage, ever spare?”
'23': >-
  “Under Kaikeyī’s rule, we shall not dwell in the kingdom as hirelings. While
  she yet lives, may we never live—so we swear—even with our sons.”
'24': >-
  “She who cruelly sends into exile the son of the lord of the earth—who, having
  obtained such a woman, unrighteous and wicked in conduct, could live happily?”
'25': >-
  “All this is thrown into turmoil—supportless, leaderless. Because of Kaikeyī’s
  deed, everything will go on to ruin.”
'26': >-
  “For when Rāma has gone into exile, the lord of the earth will not live. When
  Daśaratha dies, it is clear—destruction will follow immediately thereafter.”
'27': >-
  “Drink poison after stirring it well—wretched ones, your merit exhausted,
  fallen into great misery! Or else follow Rāghava, or go—where none may hear of
  you.”
'28': >-
  “Rāma has been falsely driven into exile, with his wife and with Lakṣmaṇa. We
  have been handed over to Bharata like beasts to a butcher.”
'29': >-
  “Rāma—whose face is like the full moon, dark-hued, with well-hidden
  collarbones, crusher of foes; whose arms reach to his knees, lotus-eyed, elder
  brother of Lakṣmaṇa—(he has been sent away).”
'30': >-
  “Courteous in speech, sweet of words, truthful, of great strength; gentle to
  all the people, lovely to behold like the moon—(he has been sent away).”
'31': >-
  “Surely that tiger among men, with the prowess of an intoxicated elephant—the
  great charioteer—will grace the forests as he wanders.”
'32': ''
'33': >-
  Thus, while the women lamented in their houses for Rāghava, the Sun went to
  his setting, and night drew near.
'34': >-
  Then that city appeared as though smeared with darkness: the blaze of fires
  had ceased, and the recitation of sacred texts and noble discourse had grown
  quiet.
'35': >-
  With trade and merchandise stilled, joy vanished, and without support, the
  city of Ayodhyā became like the sky bereft of stars.
'36': >-
  Thus the women, anguished on Rāma’s account—as when a son, or a brother, is
  sent into exile—lamenting, wretched, wept senselessly; for to them he was
  dearer even than their own sons.
'37': >-
  Then that city of Ayodhyā became one where songs and festivities, dances and
  instrumental music were stilled; joy had departed, the opening of shops was
  barred—like the great ocean with its waters dried up.
'38': >-
  Thus ends the forty-eighth sarga, named “The Lamentation of the Women of the
  City,” in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
