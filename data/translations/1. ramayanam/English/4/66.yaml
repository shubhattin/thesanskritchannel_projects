  Now begins the sixty-sixth chapter, named “The Kindling of Hanuman’s
  Strength,” in the Kishkindha Kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana. (4.66.0)
'1': >-
  Beholding that host of vanaras—numbering many hundreds and thousands—sunk in
  dejection, Jambavan then addressed Hanuman in these words. (4.66.1)
'2': >-
  O hero; O foremost among all who know the treatises of wisdom in the world of
  vanaras—O Hanuman, taking refuge in silence apart to one side, why do you not
  speak? (4.66.2)
'3': >-
  O Hanuman, you are indeed equal to King Sugriva of the vanaras; and you are
  equal to Rama and Lakshmana as well—in splendour and in strength. (4.66.3)
'4': >-
  Vainateya, the mighty son of Arishtanemi—Garutman, renowned like Garuda— is
  celebrated as the foremost of all birds. (4.66.4)
'5': >-
  Many times have I seen that mighty-armed, mighty bird in the ocean, lifting up
  serpents. (4.66.5)
'6': >-
  Whatever strength he has in his wings, you have that strength of arms and
  heroic might; nor are your prowess and your speed in any way inferior to his.
  (4.66.6)
'7': >-
  Strength, intelligence, splendour, and steadfast spirit—O bull among
  vanaras—are exceptional in you among all beings; why, then, do you not rouse
  yourself? (4.66.7)
'8': >-
  Among apsaras, the foremost and famed one was Punjikasthala, known also by the
  name Anjana, the wife of the vanara Kesarin. (4.66.8)
'9': >-
  Renowned in the three worlds and unequalled on earth in beauty, she, through a
  curse, became a she-monkey, yet retained the power to assume whatever form she
  desired. (4.66.9)
'10': >-
  She was the daughter of the noble chief of vanaras, Kunjara; assuming a human
  form, she was possessed of beauty and youth. (4.66.10)
'11': >-
  Adorned with wondrous garlands and ornaments, and at times clad in fine linen,
  she roamed upon a mountain’s summit resembling a rain-cloud in the season of
  showers. (4.66.11)
'12': >-
  As she stood upon the mountain-top, the wind gently carried away the
  auspicious garment of that large-eyed lady—yellow, with a red border.
  (4.66.12)
'13': >-
  Then he beheld her rounded thighs, well-formed and close-knit; and her full
  breasts together; and her face, well-shaped and lovely. (4.66.13)
'14': >-
  Seeing that illustrious lady—broad-hipped by nature, slender-waisted, and
  possessed of auspicious limbs—the Wind-god was overcome by desire. (4.66.14)
'15': >-
  Then Maruta, his whole being seized by the god of love, embraced that
  blameless one with his long arms, as though he had lost himself. (4.66.15)
'16': >-
  But she, startled there itself, though steadfast in her vows, spoke these
  words: “This is the vow of fidelity to one husband; who seeks to destroy it?”
  (4.66.16)
'17': >-
  Hearing Anjana’s words, Maruta replied: “O fair-hipped lady, I do not harm
  you; let there be no fear in your heart.” (4.66.17)
'18': >-
  “Because, O illustrious one, I embraced you in thought alone, a son will be
  born to you—endowed with valour and furnished with intelligence.” (4.66.18)
'19': >-
  “He will be of great spirit, great splendour, and mighty strength and prowess;
  in leaping and in bounding he shall be equal to me.” (4.66.19)
'20': >-
  Thus addressed, your mother, O great monkey, became pleased; and in a cave, O
  mighty-armed one, she brought you forth—O bull among leaping creatures.
  (4.66.20)
'21': >-
  Then, in the great forest, seeing the sun newly risen, you, though but a
  child, wishing to seize it thinking it a fruit, sprang up and soared into the
  sky. (4.66.21)
'22': >-
  Having gone three hundred yojanas, O great monkey, struck back by his
  radiance, you then did not fall into dejection. (4.66.22)
'23': >-
  And as you approached swiftly through the mid-air, O great monkey, Indra—his
  energy inflamed with wrath—hurled his thunderbolt at you. (4.66.23)
'24': >-
  Then, upon a mountain-peak, your left jaw was broken; and therefore your name
  became renowned as “Hanuman.” (4.66.24)
'25': >-
  Seeing you struck down, Vayu himself, the bearer of fragrances, grew
  exceedingly enraged, and the mighty wind did not blow at all in the three
  worlds. (4.66.25)
'26': >-
  When the three worlds were thus thrown into turmoil, all the gods, alarmed,
  sought to appease the enraged Maruta—the lords of the worlds. (4.66.26)
'27': >-
  And when the Wind was appeased, Brahma bestowed upon you a boon: that you,
  dear child—O true in prowess in battle—would not be slain by any weapon.
  (4.66.27)
'28': >-
  And seeing you uninjured even by the blow of the thunderbolt, the
  thousand-eyed Indra, gladdened at heart, granted you an excellent boon.
  (4.66.28)
'29': >-
  “May your death occur only at your own free will,”—so said the Lord. Thus you
  are the son of Kesarin, begotten in the sacred field, of dreadful prowess.
  (4.66.29)
'30': >-
  You are the true-born son of Maruta, and equal to him in splendour; indeed,
  dear child, you are Vayu’s son, and in leaping too you are his equal.
  (4.66.30)
'31': >-
  Today we are as though bereft of life; now you are our refuge—endowed with
  skill and prowess, like another king of monkeys among us. (4.66.31)
'32': >-
  In former days, dear child, I, in the three strides, circumambulated this
  earth—with its mountains, forests, and groves—three times seven times, keeping
  it to my right. (4.66.32)
'33': >-
  So too, at the command of the gods, we gathered those herbs by which, in those
  days, churning forth the nectar of immortality, we possessed great strength.
  (4.66.33)
'34': >-
  But now I am old, my prowess diminished; at present, the time belongs to you,
  who are endowed with all virtues. (4.66.34)
'35': >-
  Therefore, O mighty one, expand yourself; indeed you are the foremost of those
  who leap. All this army of vanara-heroes longs to behold your power. (4.66.35)
'36': >-
  Arise, O tiger among monkeys; leap across the great ocean. For, O Hanuman,
  unequalled among all beings is the course that is yours. (4.66.36)
'37': >-
  All the vanaras are dejected, O Hanuman—why do you disregard this? Put forth
  your prowess, O greatly swift one, as Vishnu did his three strides. (4.66.37)
'38': >-
  Then, urged on by the bull among monkeys, the son of the Wind—his speed now
  assured—delighted that host of vanara-warriors, and at that time assumed a
  vast form, according to his own will. (4.66.38)
'39': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-sixth chapter, named “The Kindling of Hanuman’s Strength,”
  in the Kishkindha Kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the Primeval Epic.
