  Now begins the twentieth sarga of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Slaying of the Fourteen Rākṣasas.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon the dreadful Śūrpaṇakhā came to the hermitage of Rāghava; and she
  beheld those two brothers—together with Sītā—(namely) those rākṣasas (who had
  come with her).
'2': >-
  They saw Rāma of mighty prowess seated in the leaf-thatched hut, with Sītā at
  his side, and attended also by Lakṣmaṇa.
'3': >-
  Seeing her and those rākṣasas who had come, the illustrious
  Rāghava—Rāma—addressed his brother Lakṣmaṇa of blazing splendour.
'4': >-
  “For a moment, O Saumitrī, stay close behind Sītā. I shall slay these
  (rākṣasas) who have come here on this path (to our dwelling).”
'5': >-
  Hearing these words of Rāma, the knower of his own Self, Lakṣmaṇa honoured
  Rāghava’s command, replying, “So be it.”
'6': >-
  Rāghava too—the righteous-souled one—made ready his great bow, adorned with
  gold, and spoke to those rākṣasas.
'7': >-
  “We are the two sons of Daśaratha, brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa; with Sītā we
  have entered the hard-to-traverse Daṇḍaka forest.
'8': >-
  Living on fruits and roots, self-restrained, ascetic, keeping the vow of
  brahmacarya, dwelling in the Daṇḍaka wilderness—why do you seek to harm us?
'9': >-
  By the injunction of the ṛṣis I have come here with bow and arrows, to slay
  you sinful ones—corrupters of brāhmaṇas—in great battle.
'10': >-
  “Be content to stand where you are; you ought not to advance. If you value
  your lives here, then turn back, O night-rangers.”
'11': >-
  Hearing his words, those fourteen rākṣasas—brahma-slayers, bearing
  spears—spoke in reply, exceedingly enraged.
'12': >-
  Terrible, with eyes reddened (with wrath), they spoke to Rāma—whose gaze was
  red with anger—harshly, (though with) honeyed speech, exultant, having seen
  his valour.
'13': >-
  “Having provoked the anger of our lord Khara, the great-souled, you yourself
  shall soon be bereft of life—slain by us this very day in battle.”
'14': >-
  “What strength have you, a single man, on the forefront of war, to stand
  before many—how much less to fight in battle?”
'15': >-
  “Struck by these clubs hurled by our arms, and by spears and pattisas, you
  shall abandon your life, your might, and your bow—crushed in your hand.”
'16': >-
  Thus speaking, those fourteen rākṣasas, raging, with swords and weapons
  uplifted, rushed straight at Rāma.
'17': >-
  They hurled those spears at Rāghava, the hard-to-conquer. Kākutstha (Rāma) (as
  for) all those spears—fourteen in number—
'18': >-
  with just as many arrows, adorned with gold, he cut them to pieces. Then
  afterwards that great-tejā (Rāma), exceedingly radiant, took up nārāca arrows,
  like unto the sun.
'19': >-
  In supreme anger he grasped fourteen (arrows) with whetted, stone-like points;
  and, seizing them, he drew his bow, aiming at those rākṣasas as his targets.
'20': >-
  Rāghava released the arrows like thunderbolts shot by Śatakratu (Indra).
  Piercing, by their speed, the rākṣasas’ chests, they were drenched in blood.
'21': >-
  Then they fell upon the earth, like serpents (issuing) from an anthill; their
  hearts shattered, they lay on the ground, like trees cut off at the root.
'22': >-
  They collapsed, bathed in blood, mangled, and bereft of life. Seeing those
  rākṣasas fallen on the ground, the rākṣasī (Śūrpaṇakhā) fainted in a swoon of
  wrath.
'23': >-
  Approaching Khara, she—her blood somewhat dried—fell down again in distress,
  like a creeper oozing resin.
'24': >-
  Near her brother, tormented with grief, she uttered a great cry; with voice
  breaking, she released tears then, her face grown pale.
'25': >-
  Beholding the rākṣasas struck down in battle, Śūrpaṇakhā again ran thence; and
  she fully reported to Khara—her brother—everything: the complete slaughter of
  those rākṣasas.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the twentieth sarga of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  holy, ancient epic, called “The Slaying of the Fourteen Rākṣasas.”
