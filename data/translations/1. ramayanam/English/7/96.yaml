  Now, in the sacred Valmiki Ramayana—within the Uttara Kanda—begins the
  ninety-sixth sarga, named “Valmiki’s Giving of Proof (of Sita’s purity).”
'1': >-
  When that night had passed and dawn had broken, the king—the mighty
  Raghava—went to the sacrificial enclosure and caused all the sages to be
  summoned.
'2': >-
  Vasishta and Vamadeva, and Jabali, and Kasyapa; Visvamitra of prolonged
  austerity; and Durvasa, the great ascetic—
'3': >-
  Pulastya likewise, and Sakti; and the Bhargava; and Vamana; and Markandeya of
  long life; and Maudgalya of great renown—
'4': >-
  Garga and Chyavana as well; and Satananda, the knower of dharma; and
  Bharadvaja, radiant with spiritual lustre; and Agni’s son, the splendid—
'5': >-
  Narada and Parvata as well; Gautama of great fame; Katyayana; Suyajna; and
  Agastya, a very treasure-house of austerities—
'6': >-
  These and many other sages of firm vows—all of them, seized with curiosity,
  assembled there.
'7': >-
  The rakshasas of great heroism and the vanaras of great strength—all the
  noble-souled also came together, drawn by curiosity.
'8': >-
  Kshatriyas and Shudras and Vaishyas too, by the thousands; and brahmanas of
  firm vows, coming from many different lands—
'9': >-
  Some steadfast in knowledge, some steadfast in ritual action, and others
  steadfast in yoga—all assembled to behold Sita’s oath.
'10': >-
  Then, hearing that all had assembled—like a mountain turned to stone—the best
  of sages swiftly arrived, with Sita beside him.
'11': >-
  Behind that rishi Sita followed, her face cast down; with palms joined in
  reverence, her throat choked with tears, holding Rama within her mind.
'12': >-
  Seeing Sita coming behind Valmiki—like sacred revelation itself approaching,
  following Brahma—a great cry of “Well done!” arose.
'13': >-
  Then a tumultuous sound of “Alas! Alas!” spread among them all, as the hearts
  of the people were thrown into distress by vast sorrow born of suffering.
'14': >-
  Some cried, “Well done, Rama!” while others cried, “Well done, Sita!” and yet
  other onlookers there shouted acclaim for both of them.
'15': >-
  Then the foremost of sages, entering the midst of the multitude with Sita at
  his side, spoke thus to Raghava:
'16': >-
  “This is Sita of Dasaratha’s house—of excellent vows, a doer of
  dharma—abandoned by you because of calumny; she was left near my hermitage.
'17': >-
  O Rama, great in vow—since you were afraid of the world’s reproach—Sita will
  now give you proof (of her purity). Grant permission for that.”
'18': >-
  “And these two sons of Janaki are both your own—twin-born like Yama’s
  pair—your sons, invincible; this truth I declare to you.”
'19': >-
  “I am the tenth son of Prachetas, O joy of the Raghavas; I do not recall ever
  speaking an untrue word—these two indeed are your sons.”
'20': >-
  “For many thousands of years I have practised austerity; may I not partake of
  the fruit of that austerity, if this Maithili is impure.”
'21': >-
  “If she has committed any sin at any time—by mind, by deed, or by speech—then
  may I partake of the fruit of that sin; but (I declare) this Maithili is
  without sin.”
'22': >-
  “I, O Raghava—having reflected upon Sita in respect to the five elements and
  the mind as the sixth—took her as pure from a forest stream.”
'23': >-
  “This one is of stainless conduct, sinless, devoted to her husband as to a
  deity; for you, who feared the world’s reproach, she will give proof.”
'24': >-
  “Therefore this daughter of the best of men is of a pure disposition, and then
  entered the realm within the range of divine vision—she whom you, though she
  was known to be pure, abandoned as your beloved, because your mind had been
  sullied by the stain of the world’s reproach.”
'25': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-sixth sarga of the Uttara Kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Adi-Kavya, entitled “Valmiki’s Giving of Proof.”
