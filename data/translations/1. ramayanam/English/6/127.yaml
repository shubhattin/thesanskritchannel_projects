  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-twenty-seventh sarga, called “The Reception by Bharadvāja.”
'1': >-
  When the full fourteen years had been completed, on the fifth day, Lakṣmaṇa’s
  elder brother (Rāma) reached the hermitage of Bharadvāja and, with mind
  restrained in reverence, paid obeisance to the sage.
'2': >-
  Having greeted him, he questioned Bharadvāja, that treasure of austerity: “Do
  you hear, O Blessed One, that all is well and that there is abundance of
  provisions in the city? Is Bharata devoted to righteous conduct? And are my
  mothers still living?”
'3': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, the great sage Bharadvāja replied to the foremost of
  the Raghus, with a smile first appearing, as one exceedingly delighted.
'4': >-
  “Bharata, obedient to command, waits for you, wearing matted locks, placing
  your sandals at the fore; and in the household all is well.”
'5': >-
  “Formerly I saw you entering the great forest, clad in bark-garments, with a
  woman as the third companion, fallen from sovereignty—one who desired only
  dharma and loved righteousness.”
'6': >-
  “I saw you going on foot, having abandoned everything, carrying out your
  father’s injunction; renouncing all enjoyments—like a deva fallen from heaven,
  deprived of celestial delights.”
'7': >-
  “Seeing you then, O conqueror in battle, compassion arose in me—seeing you,
  bound by Kaikeyī’s word, living on forest roots and fruits.”
'8': >-
  “But now, beholding you possessed of prosperous aims, surrounded by friends,
  troops, and kinsmen, and seeing you as one who has conquered his foes, supreme
  joy has arisen in me.”
'9': >-
  “All your happiness and sorrow are known to me, O Rāghava—everything that you,
  dwelling at Jana-sthāna, encountered in vast measure.”
'10': >-
  “When you were engaged for the sake of the brāhmaṇas, protecting on every side
  all the ascetics, your blameless wife was carried off by Rāvaṇa.”
'11': >-
  “And I know of the sight of Mārīca, and of Sītā’s anguish and agitation; and
  also of the meeting with Kabandha, and likewise your going to Pampā.”
'12': >-
  “And I know of your friendship with Sugrīva, where Vālī was slain by you; and
  also of the search for the princess of Videha, and the deeds of the Wind-god’s
  son (Hanumān).”
'13': >-
  “And when Vaidehī was known to be found—how the bridge was built by Nala; and
  how Laṅkā was set ablaze by the delighted leaders of the hosts of
  Hari-monkeys.”
'14': >-
  “And how, together with his sons, kinsmen, and ministers, with his army and
  with his mounts and vehicles, Rāvaṇa—intoxicated with the pride of his
  might—was slain in battle.”
'15': >-
  “And how, when that Rāvaṇa, the thorn of the gods, had been slain—how there
  was a meeting with the Thirty-three gods, and how a boon was bestowed upon
  you.”
'16': >-
  “All this is known to me by austerity, O you who cherish dharma; and my
  disciples as well—those who report tidings—come to me, bringing news from the
  city.”
'17': >-
  “I too now grant you a boon here, O best among those who bear weapons: accept
  this arghya (honor-offering); tomorrow you shall go to Ayodhyā.”
'18': >-
  Receiving that statement with bowed head, the prince, radiant and gladdened,
  said only, “So be it,” and asked for a boon.
'19': >-
  “Let there be trees bearing fruit out of season, and all of them dripping with
  honey; and let there be many fruits of diverse kinds, fragrant like nectar.”
'20': >-
  “Let them be upon the path, O Blessed One, for us as we go toward Ayodhyā.”
  When he had thus promised, “So be it,” immediately upon his word—
'21': >-
  —the trees there became like the celestial trees of heaven: those without
  fruit became fruit-laden; those without blossoms became rich with flowers.
'22': >-
  Those trees that were dry became full with fresh leaves, and the mountains too
  flowed with honey; and for the travelers, this came to be on every side for a
  stretch of three yojanas.
'23': >-
  Then those foremost of the monkeys, filled with delight, ate at will—by the
  thousand—many divine fruits, rejoicing, as though they had conquered heaven
  itself.
'24': >-
  Thus ends, in the venerable, holy Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the first of poets, in
  the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the one-hundred-and-twenty-seventh sarga, called “The
  Reception by Bharadvāja.”
