  Now begins the ninety-first canto in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Hospitality of Bharadvāja.”
'1': >-
  Then that sage, having resolved to provide them lodging there itself, invited
  Bharata, the son of Kaikeyī, with due rites of hospitality.
'2': >-
  But Bharata said to him, “Surely this has already been done by you—water for
  washing the feet, the offering of arghya, and such hospitality as befits one
  dwelling in the forest.”
'3': >-
  Then Bharadvāja spoke to Bharata, as though smiling: “I know you to be filled
  with affection; you are one who is pleased with whatever is offered.”
'4': >-
  “Yet I wish to provide a meal for this entire army of yours, in a manner
  befitting my goodwill. You are worthy of it, O lord of men.”
'5': >-
  “And why, having left your forces at a distance, have you come here? Why did
  you not approach here accompanied by your army, O best of men?”
'6': >-
  With joined palms, Bharata replied to that sage rich in ascetic merit: “O
  Blessed One, I have not approached with the army, out of fear of offending
  your holiness.”
'7': >-
  “For ascetics dwelling in the countryside should always be carefully
  avoided—whether by the king, O Blessed One, or always by a prince—so that they
  be not disturbed.”
'8': >-
  “Foremost horses, men, and mighty elephants in rut would, covering the earth,
  follow behind me in great numbers.”
'9': >-
  “Fearing that they might harm the trees, the waters, the ground, the
  hermitages and the leaf-huts, I have therefore come alone.”
'10': >-
  Commanded by the great ṛṣi, ‘Let the army be brought here,’ Bharata then had
  his forces come forward.
'11': >-
  Entering the fire-sanctuary, and having sipped water and cleansed himself, the
  sage, for the sake of performing the rites of hospitality, invoked
  Viśvakarman.
'12': >-
  “I summon Viśvakarman, and also Tvaṣṭṛ himself. I desire to render
  hospitality; let preparations be made for me in that regard.”
'13': >-
  “I summon the three guardians of the worlds, and the gods with Indra at their
  head. I desire to render hospitality; let preparations be made for me in that
  regard.”
'14': >-
  “Let the rivers that flow eastward, and those that flow westward—on earth and
  in the firmament—come today from every quarter.”
'15': >-
  “Let some flow with maireya (a kind of spirit), others with well-prepared
  surā; and yet others with cool water resembling the juice of
  sugarcane-stalks.”
'16': >-
  “I summon the divine Gandharvas—Viśvāvasu, Hāhā, and Hūhū; and likewise all
  the Apsarases, the goddesses, and all the Gandharvīs as well.”
'17': >-
  “Ghṛtācī, Viśvācī, Miśrakeśī, and Alambusā; Nāgadantā, Hemā, and Himā of
  mountain-fashioned hips—”
'18': >-
  “and all those women who attend upon Indra, and those who attend upon
  Brahmā—together with Tumburu, I summon them all, with their attendants and
  equipage.”
'19': >-
  “Let that divine forest in the land of the Kurus—abounding in garments,
  ornaments, and foliage, and ever bearing fruit like heavenly maidens—let that
  Kubera’s grove come here.”
'20': >-
  “Here, let the venerable Soma provide for me the choicest food—things to be
  chewed and things to be eaten, things to be sucked and things to be licked—of
  many and various kinds.”
'21': >-
  “Let there be wondrous garlands, and flowers fallen from trees; drinks
  beginning with surā; and meats of diverse kinds as well.”
'22': >-
  Thus endowed with perfect concentration, with incomparable spiritual
  splendour, and with the proper intonation and resonance of sacred recitation,
  the sage spoke by the power of his austerities.
'23': >-
  As he meditated in his mind—facing east, with hands joined in reverence—all
  those deities came, each in their own place and manner.
'24': >-
  Then the wind, bringing with it the scents of Malaya and Dardura and other
  fragrant regions, touched all gently and blew in due measure—pleasing to the
  heart, soothing, and auspicious.
'25': >-
  Then divine clouds poured down showers of flowers; and the sound of heavenly
  drums was heard in all the directions.
'26': >-
  Excellent breezes blew, and hosts of Apsarases danced; the divine Gandharvas
  sang, and their vīṇās released sweet notes.
'27': >-
  That sound—smoothly uttered, even, and endowed with rhythm and melody—entered
  the heavens and the earth, and the ears of living beings as well.
'28': >-
  When that divine music, so delightful to the hearers, came to an end, Bharata
  beheld the arrangement fashioned for the army by Viśvakarman.
'29': >-
  For the ground became level all around, for a circuit of five yojanas, covered
  with many lawns, resembling blue vaidūrya (lapis-lazuli).
'30': >-
  There were bilva trees and kapittha trees, jackfruit and citron; and āmalaka
  trees, and mangoes adorned with fruit.
'31': >-
  And from the northern Kurus came a divine forest fit for heavenly enjoyment;
  and a divine river came, bordered by many flowering banks.
'32': >-
  White four-sided pavilions appeared, and stables for elephants and horses;
  mansions and palaces closely set; and splendid gateways as well.
'33': >-
  And at the royal dwellings there was a gateway like a white cloud, shaped as
  though fashioned of heavenly garlands, and sprinkled with celestial fragrance.
'34': >-
  Square and well-appointed, furnished with beds and seats; endowed with all
  delightful flavours; with divine food and garments; with every kind of dish
  laid out; and with vessels washed and spotless.
'35': >-
  That radiant Bharata, Kaikeyī’s son—every seat arranged, the best of beds well
  spread—entered that jewel-filled residence, having received the permission of
  the great ṛṣi.
'36': >-
  And all the ministers, together with the family priest, followed him; and they
  were filled with joy upon seeing the arrangements of that residence.
'37': >-
  There, a divine royal throne, a fan, and a parasol were set forth; and
  Bharata, along with the ministers, was attended to as a king.
'38': >-
  He honoured that seat, and bowing to Rāma, took a yak-tail fan in hand and sat
  down on the seat of a minister.
'39': >-
  Then, in due order, all the ministers and priests sat down; after them, the
  commander of the army and the chief administrator also took their seats.
'40': >-
  Then, in a short while, rivers whose mud was rice-pudding (pāyasa) presented
  themselves before Bharata, by Bharadvāja’s command.
'41': >-
  And on both their banks were delightful divine lodgings, plastered with pale
  clay—mansions produced by Brahmā’s grace.
'42': >-
  At that very same moment, twenty thousand women adorned with divine ornaments
  arrived—sent by Brahmā.
'43': >-
  And twenty thousand more women arrived, radiant with gold, jewels, pearls, and
  coral—sent by Kubera.
'44': >-
  And twenty thousand troops of Apsarases from Nandana arrived—by whom any man
  who is seized appears as though mad.
'45': >-
  Nārada, Tumburu, and Gopa, the foremost—shining with the splendour of the
  sun—these kings of the Gandharvas sang before Bharata.
'46': >-
  Alambusā, Miśrakeśī, Puṇḍarīkā, and Vāmanā danced, O Bharata, by Bharadvāja’s
  command.
'47': >-
  Such garlands as are found among the gods, and such as are in the forest of
  Citraratha, were seen there at Prayāga by the puissance of Bharadvāja.
'48': >-
  Bilva trees became like drummers; śamyā trees became ‘seizers’ (as though
  laying hold); vibhītaka trees appeared; and aśvattha trees became dancers—all
  by Bharadvāja’s command.
'49': >-
  Then śarala and tāla trees, tilaka and naktamālaka too, gathered there in
  joy—becoming hunchbacked and dwarf-like, as it were.
'50': >-
  Śiṃśupā, āmalakī, jambu, and the other trees found in groves; and creepers
  such as mālatī, mallikā, and jāti, and others in the forest—
'51': >-
  taking on the forms of lovely women in Bharadvāja’s hermitage, they spoke: “O
  drinkers of surā, drink; and you who hunger, eat rice-pudding; and let
  excellent meats, most fit to be eaten, be consumed as long as you desire.”
'52': >-
  On charming river-banks they anointed and bathed the men; and seven or eight
  maidens attended upon even a single man.
'53': >-
  Beautiful-eyed women assembled, massaging them; and having wiped them, those
  fair-limbed ladies made them drink, ministering to one another’s charges as
  well.
'54': >-
  And the keepers of the mounts fed the horses, elephants, donkeys and camels,
  and likewise the offspring of Surabhī (cows), giving to each the proper fodder
  as ordained.
'55': >-
  They fed the mounts with sugarcane and honeyed parched grains; and those
  mighty men urged on and attended the warriors of the Ikṣvāku line.
'56': >-
  There was no groom who recognized his own horse, no elephant-handler his
  elephant; there, in that place, all became confused—some drunk, some frenzied
  with delight.
'57': >-
  Satisfied with every desire, anointed with red sandal-paste, and accompanied
  by troops of Apsarases, the soldiers raised their voices and spoke.
'58': >-
  “We shall go neither to Ayodhyā, nor shall we go to Daṇḍaka. Let it be well
  with Bharata; and likewise, let there be happiness for Rāma.”
'59': >-
  Thus spoke the foot-soldiers, and the horsemen, and the elephant-riders, and
  those attached to their mounts—having gained such arrangements, like men who
  had found a protector.
'60': >-
  Those men, thousands upon thousands, cried out in joy there; and Bharata’s
  followers exclaimed, “This is heaven!”
'61': >-
  The soldiers danced, laughed, and sang; adorned with garlands, they ran about
  on every side in their thousands.
'62': >-
  Then, though they had eaten, when they beheld that nectar-like food and those
  divine viands, their minds again turned to eating.
'63': >-
  Servants, attendants, brides, and the forces in their thousands became
  exceedingly elated; and all were clad in unsoiled garments.
'64': >-
  Elephants, donkeys, camels, cows, horses, and deer and birds were well cared
  for there; none made any distinction of ‘mine’ and ‘another’s’.
'65': >-
  There was no one in white garments alone (as a mark of austerity), nor anyone
  hungry, nor even anyone dirty; nor was any man seen with hair ruined by dust.
'66': >-
  There were dishes prepared from goats and boars, with heaps of well-seasoned
  sauces; and soups perfected with fruit-juices, endowed with fragrance and
  taste.
'67': >-
  There the men beheld, in amazement, thousands of iron cauldrons filled,
  bearing banners of flowers, and set all around with white food.
'68': >-
  Along the edges of the forest were wells filled with rice-pudding-mud; there
  were cows that granted every desire, and trees that dripped honey.
'69': >-
  There were also ponds filled with maireya, surrounded by heaps of choice
  meats; and along the roads were heated ovens, with peacocks and cocks
  (prepared for food).
'70': >-
  There were thousands of cups, tens of thousands of pots, and hundreds of
  millions of vessels, made of pure gold.
'71': >-
  There were bowls, jars, and vats filled with well-prepared curds—fragrant,
  fresh, and white like milk in the prime of youth; and (curds) scented like
  kapittha fruit.
'72': >-
  Some lakes were full of rasāla; others of thick white curd; yet others were of
  rice-pudding; and there were heaps of sugar besides.
'73': >-
  The men saw at the bathing-places of the rivers vessels set out with various
  cleansing pastes—wet ground mixtures, powders, astringent washes—and diverse
  bath-preparations.
'74': >-
  They saw also stacks of white tooth-sticks gleaming, and white sandalwood
  pastes remaining in caskets.
'75': >-
  They saw polished mirrors, heaps of garments, and sandals and shoes too—pairs
  upon pairs in their thousands.
'76': >-
  Ointment-boxes, combs, brushes; weapons and bows; wondrous armour for vital
  parts; beds and seats as well.
'77': >-
  And for donkeys, camels, elephants, and horses there were drinking-lakes
  filled full; and, entering excellent bathing-places, they saw ponds with
  lotuses and water-lilies.
'78': >-
  Clear-watered and easy to ford, appearing like the very colour of the sky; and
  they saw soft heaps of fodder, blue as vaidūrya (lapis-lazuli).
'79': >-
  Everywhere they beheld cattle placed there for the purpose of refreshing and
  sustaining the animals.
'80': >-
  Those men were filled with wonder upon seeing that marvellous hospitality,
  dreamlike in its splendour, rendered to Bharata by the great ṛṣi.
'81': >-
  Thus, as they sported in delight like gods in Nandana, that night passed by in
  the lovely hermitage of Bharadvāja.
'82': >-
  And those rivers returned as they had come; and the Gandharvas too departed
  likewise; and all those fair women, having taken leave of Bharadvāja, went
  away.
'83': >-
  And just so, the men remained intoxicated and exulting with wine; and just so,
  they were anointed with divine aloe and sandal; and just so, splendid garlands
  of many kinds lay scattered separately, trampled by men in their revelry.
'84': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-first canto, entitled “The Hospitality of Bharadvāja,” in
  the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the holy and illustrious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the first
  of poets.
