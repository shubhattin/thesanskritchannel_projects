  Now begins the sixty-first canto in the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Entry into Madhuvana.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter the forest-dwellers accepted the words of Jāmbavān—those heroic
  vānaras headed by Aṅgada, and Hanumān too, the great ape.
'2': >-
  Then all of them, filled with delight, with the Son of the Wind at their head,
  sprang up from the crest of Mahendra and leapt forward—the foremost among the
  plavagas.
'3': >-
  Resembling Meru and Mandara, like great elephants gone mad with exhilaration,
  of vast bodies and mighty strength, they seemed, as it were, to cover the sky.
'4': >-
  That Hanumān—self-possessed, exceedingly strong, and of tremendous speed—was
  being honored by all beings; and the others seemed to bear him aloft with
  their very looks.
'5': >-
  Having firmly resolved to bring to Rāghava the fulfilment of his purpose, and
  to win supreme renown, their aims now richly accomplished, and exalted by the
  success of their deeds, they advanced.
'6': >-
  All of them were eager to tell the beloved tidings; all were delighted by
  battle; all were steadfast and high-souled, certain of their purpose in
  rendering service to Rāma.
'7': >-
  Leaping through the air and traversing the heavens, those denizens of the
  woods then reached a forest like Nandana itself—filled with tens of thousands
  of trees.
'8': >-
  That was the grove named Madhuvana, under Sugrīva’s protection—unassailable by
  all beings, and pleasing to the minds of all creatures.
'9': >-
  It was ever guarded by the great hero, the vānara named Dadhimukha—the
  maternal uncle of the noble Sugrīva, lord among the apes.
'10': >-
  Approaching that grove, the vānaras became exceedingly impetuous, coming upon
  that great forest dear to the heart of the lord of the vānaras.
'11': >-
  Then, delighted on seeing that vast Madhuvana, those honey-tawny vānaras
  besought the prince for honey.
'12': >-
  Thereupon the prince, having assented regarding those aged leaders of apes
  headed by Jāmbavān, granted them leave to partake of the honey.
'13': >-
  Released by the wise prince, the son of Vāli, those haris rushed upon the
  trees swarming with bees.
'14': >-
  Feasting on fragrant roots and fruits, they all attained great exhilaration
  and became wild with intoxication.
'15': >-
  And then, all those forest-dwellers—permitted and greatly rejoicing—became
  glad, and here and there they began to dance.
'16': >-
  Some sang; some laughed; some danced; some bowed down; some fell to the
  ground; some roamed about; some leapt; and some babbled on.
'17': >-
  Some clung to one another; some spoke loudly to one another. Some ran from
  tree to tree; and some fell from mountain-peaks down to the earth.
'18': >-
  Some, their speed greatly increased, sprang from the ground onto the tops of
  huge trees. One approached laughing at a singer; another came weeping to one
  who laughed.
'19': >-
  Yet another came shouting to one who was striking; thus that army of apes
  became utterly tumultuous. And there was none there who was not intoxicated,
  and none there who was not insolent with pride.
'20': >-
  Then, seeing that forest being consumed and the trees with leaves and blossoms
  destroyed, the ape named Dadhivaktra, in anger, began to restrain those apes.
'21': >-
  But the guardian of the grove—that aged, heroic vānara—being reviled by them
  in their increasing frenzy, once again set his mind, fierce in energy, to the
  task of protecting the forest from the vānaras.
'22': >-
  To some he spoke harsh words, without fear; others he struck with the palms of
  his hands. With certain ones he came together and made quarrel; and to some he
  likewise resorted with conciliatory speech.
'23': >-
  But those apes, impelled by intoxication and of irresistible speed, and being
  restrained by him only with force, came together—having abandoned fear in
  their assault—and dragged him about, heedless of any fault.
'24': >-
  Scratching with nails, biting with teeth, and striking with palms and feet,
  those apes in their drunkenness ravaged that great forest on all sides and
  made it as though it were without a master.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-first canto in the Sundara-kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the ancient epic, called “The Entry into Madhuvana.”
