  Now begins, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-fifteenth canto, named “The Dwelling at Nandigrāma.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon, having firmly resolved and, as it were, laid down the charge of
  Ayodhyā at his mothers’ feet, Bharata—burning with grief—then spoke these
  words to the venerable elders.
'2': >-
  “I shall go to Nandigrāma. Today I take leave of you all. There, bereft of
  Rāghava, I shall endure this entire sorrow.”
'3': >-
  “For the king has gone to heaven, and my preceptor too abides in the forest. I
  await Rāma for the sake of the kingdom, for that great-glorious one is truly
  the king.”
'4': >-
  Hearing these auspicious words of that great-souled Bharata, all the
  ministers, and Vasiṣṭha the royal priest, addressed him.
'5': >-
  “Exceedingly praiseworthy indeed is what you have spoken, O Bharata; your
  speech, born of affection for your brother, is altogether befitting of you.”
'6': >-
  “As you stand ever devoted to brotherly friendship, longing only for your
  kinsman, having entered upon the noble path—what man would not approve of
  you?”
'7': >-
  Having heard the ministers’ words—welcome and dear, according to his own
  desire—he spoke to his charioteer: “Let my chariot be yoked.”
'8': >-
  With a glad countenance, that illustrious prince saluted all his mothers, and
  then mounted the chariot, accompanied by Śatrughna.
'9': >-
  Swiftly ascending the chariot, the two—Śatrughna and Bharata—set forth in the
  highest joy, attended by the ministers and the household priest.
'10': >-
  In front went the venerable elders—twice-born sages with Vasiṣṭha at their
  head—proceeding all of them facing east, toward where Nandigrāma lay.
'11': >-
  And that army too—unbidden, crowded with elephants, horses, and chariots—set
  out when Bharata departed, and all the citizens as well.
'12': >-
  Seated in the chariot, that righteous-souled Bharata, loving his brother
  dearly, hastened to Nandigrāma, bearing the sandals upon his head.
'13': >-
  Then Bharata quickly entered Nandigrāma; and, alighting swiftly from the
  chariot, he spoke this to the elders.
'14': >-
  “This kingdom has been given to me by my brother himself, as though as a
  renunciant’s trust; and these two sandals, adorned with gold, bear the welfare
  and security of the realm.”
'15': >-
  Then Bharata, placing the sandals upon his head as his act of renunciation,
  spoke—tormented with sorrow—to the entire circle of subjects and officers.
'16': >-
  “Hold the royal parasol quickly—these two are deemed to be my noble lord’s
  very feet. In the kingdom, righteousness is established through these two
  sandals—my teacher’s sandals.”
'17': >-
  “Indeed, out of affection, my brother has placed this renunciation upon me.
  This I shall uphold until Rāghava’s return.”
'18': >-
  “Then, swiftly reuniting them with Rāghava himself, I shall behold those two
  feet of Rāma together with the sandals.”
'19': >-
  “Thereafter, my burden set down, when I have met Rāghava, I shall present the
  kingdom to my preceptor and take up the way of life of one who serves the
  गुरु.”
'20': >-
  “And having given back to Rāghava this renunciant’s charge of mine, along with
  these excellent sandals, and this kingdom and Ayodhyā, I shall become one
  whose sins are washed away.”
'21': >-
  “But when the son of Kakutstha is consecrated, and the people are delighted
  and uplifted, my joy and my fame too shall become fourfold, beyond that of
  sovereignty.”
'22': >-
  Thus lamenting, despondent, that great-glorious Bharata established rule at
  Nandigrāma, sorrowing, together with his ministers.
'23': >-
  Clad in bark-garments and wearing matted hair, assuming the guise of an
  ascetic, that lordly hero Bharata then dwelt at Nandigrāma, together with his
  army.
'24': >-
  Yearning for Rāma’s coming, Bharata—dearly loving his brother, a doer of his
  brother’s command, and one who had gone to the very end of his vow—remained
  there.
'25': >-
  After anointing the sandals, Bharata then lived at Nandigrāma; and he
  submitted all governance and command to those two sandals.
'26': >-
  Then the illustrious Bharata, having consecrated the noble sandals, caused the
  kingdom to be administered always as dependent upon them.
'27': >-
  Indeed, whatever matter came to be done at that time, and whatever valuable
  offering was brought, Bharata first presented it to the sandals, and only
  afterward carried it out duly, in proper manner.
'28': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa—the sacred, ancient epic—in the
  Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, the one-hundred-and-fifteenth canto, named “The Dwelling at
  Nandigrāma.”
