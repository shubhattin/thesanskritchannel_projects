  Now begins the Seventy-second Sarga of the Aranyakanda of the glorious
  Valmiki-Ramayana, entitled “The Means of Finding Sita.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by Kabandha, those two heroic lords of men, having reached a
  mountain-cave, consigned him to the fire.
'2': >-
  Then Lakshmana, on every side with great blazing brands, kindled the funeral
  pyre; and it blazed up all around.
'3': >-
  That vast body of Kabandha, like a great mass of clarified butter, the fire
  consumed slowly, as it was being melted by its fat.
'4': >-
  Shaking off the pyre swiftly, he arose like smokeless fire, mighty of
  strength, wearing spotless garments and a divine garland.
'5': >-
  Then, borne upward by the force of the pyre, radiant and clad in stainless
  raiment, he sprang aloft at once, rejoicing, adorned in all his limbs with
  ornaments.
'6': >-
  Standing in a shining aerial car, yoked with swans and conferring renown, that
  great and radiant one, by his splendor, illumined the ten directions.
'7': >-
  Having gone into the sky, Kabandha spoke these words to Rama: “Hear, O
  Raghava, in truth, how you shall regain Sita.”
'8': >-
  “O Rama, there are six strategies in the world by which everything is
  deliberated; but he who examines by ten—by the full tenfold measure—employs a
  tenth part in serviceable action.”
'9': >-
  “You, O Rama, together with Lakshmana, are fallen short by a tenth part; for
  which deficiency you have met with calamity—the violation of your wife.”
'10': >-
  “Therefore you must surely make that one your friend, O best of friends; for
  without doing so, as I ponder, I do not see success for you.”
'11': >-
  “Listen, O Rama, I shall tell you: there is a vanara named Sugriva, driven out
  by his wrathful brother Vali, son of Indra.”
'12': >-
  “On the excellent mountain Rishyamuka, beautified up to the borders of Pampa,
  that self-possessed hero dwells with four vanaras.”
'13': >-
  “That lord of the vanaras is of great valor, full of splendor, of immeasurable
  radiance; true to his vows, disciplined, steadfast, intelligent, and great.”
'14': >-
  “Skilful, bold, lustrous, of mighty strength and prowess—he, that great-souled
  hero, has been exiled by his brother for the sake of the kingdom.”
'15': >-
  “He shall be your helper and your friend in the search for Sita; therefore, O
  Rama, do not set your mind upon grief.”
'16': >-
  “That too is destined to be, and here it cannot be otherwise, O tiger among
  the Ikshvakus; for Time is indeed hard to pass beyond.”
'17': >-
  “Go quickly from here, O hero, to that mighty Sugriva. Make him your
  companion-friend without delay, O Raghava, going to him this very day.”
'18': >-
  “Approach him without treachery, while the fire yet blazes; and you must not
  show contempt toward Sugriva, the lord of the vanaras.”
'19': >-
  “Grateful, able to assume forms at will, seeking an ally, and valorous—he has
  the power today to accomplish the deed that he desires, with you two.”
'20': >-
  “Whether he is one whose purpose has been fulfilled or not fulfilled, he will
  do what is to be done for you. He is the son of Riksharajas and wanders by
  Pampa, ever wary.”
'21': >-
  “Vali—own son of the Sun—has wronged him. Having set aside your weapons,
  quickly approach that vanara in the abode of Rishyamuka.”
'22': >-
  “O Raghava, in good faith make friendship with that forest-dwelling one, for
  that elephant among monkeys knows all places in their entirety.”
'23': >-
  “In the world, through his skill, he ranges even among man-eating beings; and
  there is nothing whatsoever in the world unknown to him, O Raghava.”
'24': >-
  “So long as the thousand-rayed Sun scorches, O scorcher of foes, he will,
  having searched rivers, vast mountains, mountain-fastnesses, and caves—”
'25': >-
  “—together with the vanaras, find your wife; and he will dispatch great-bodied
  vanaras as well, O Raghava,”
'26': >-
  “to traverse the quarters in search of that Sita who mourns because of
  separation from you; he will seek the fair-hipped Maithili in Ravana’s abode.”
'27': >-
  “Whether she be on the summit of Meru, faultless one; or having entered even
  to the nether regions and taken refuge on the floor of the underworld—he, the
  bull among the monkey-tribe, will slay the rakshasas and restore your beloved
  to you again.”
'28': >-
  Thus ends the Seventy-second Sarga in the Aranyakanda of the glorious
  Valmiki-Ramayana, the primeval epic, entitled “The Means of Finding Sita.”
