  Now begins the first chapter, named “Rāma’s Entrancement in the Delusion of
  Separation,” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, accompanied by Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), went to that lotus-lake
  (Puṣkariṇī), thronged with lotuses, water-lilies, and fish; and with his
  senses disquieted, he lamented.
'2': >-
  There, on merely beholding it, his senses trembled with gladness; but being
  overpowered by desire, he spoke thus to Saumitri.
'3': >-
  “Saumitri, Pampa is resplendent—its waters are clear as vaidūrya (lapis
  lazuli), abounding in fully-blown lotuses and lilies, and beautified by trees
  of many kinds.”
'4': >-
  “Saumitri, behold Pampa’s woodland, fair to see, where mountains and trees
  appear to shine, as though the trees were peaks with their crests.”
'5': >-
  “But for me, scorched by sorrow, afflictions indeed torment me—both because of
  Bharata’s grief and because of the abduction of Vaidehī (Sītā).”
'6': >-
  “Even for me, though distressed by grief, Pampa with her wondrous groves is
  beautiful—strewn with many kinds of flowers, cool-watered, and auspicious.”
'7': >-
  “Covered over with lotuses too, exceedingly delightful to behold, frequented
  by serpents and fierce creatures, and filled with deer and birds.”
'8': >-
  “All the more this blue-and-yellow meadow-grass shines, as though offered up
  with many kinds of floral strewn coverings from the trees.”
'9': >-
  “On every side the mountain ridges are rich with the weight of blossoms, and
  everywhere they are closely embraced by creepers whose tips are in flower.”
'10': >-
  “This is a season of gentle breezes, Saumitri, and abundant love’s desire;
  this fragrant month is sweet-smelling, and the trees have put forth flowers
  and fruit.”
'11': >-
  “See, Saumitri, the forms of these forests laden with blossoms, pouring forth
  showers of flowers like rain-clouds sending down rain.”
'12': >-
  “And on lovely rock-slabs, diverse forest-trees, stirred by the force of the
  wind, scatter flowers upon the earth.”
'13': >-
  “With flowers fallen, falling, and still upon the trees, the wind—look,
  Saumitri—seems to sport everywhere with those blossoms.”
'14': >-
  “Scattering the many blossom-heavy branches of the mountains’ trees, the wind
  is accompanied as though with song by bees, displaced from their
  resting-places.”
'15': >-
  “Making the trees dance, as it were, with the calls of intoxicated cuckoos,
  the breeze that issues from mountain-caves sounds as though it were singing.”
'16': >-
  “Driven and tossed about so greatly by that wind on every side, these trees
  with intertwined branch-tips appear as though they were knotted together.”
'17': >-
  “The same breeze, pleasant to the touch and cool as sandalwood, bears a holy
  fragrance and is a remover of fatigue.”
'18': >-
  “These trees, shaken by the wind, seem as though they are making sounds, in
  honey-fragrant woods, with bees humming in accompaniment.”
'19': >-
  “On delightful mountain-slopes, charming with flowering trees, the mountains
  with peaks close set together shine, adorned with great trees.”
'20': >-
  “With flower-covered crests and swaying under the wind’s lifting, these trees
  crowned with bees appear as though they are chanting.”
'21': >-
  “Behold on every side these karṇikāra trees in full bloom, as though covered
  with gold—like men clad in yellow garments.”
'22': >-
  “This springtime, Saumitri—resounding with the cries of many birds—kindles my
  grief, for I am separated from Sītā.”
'23': >-
  “Indeed Kāma (the god of love) burns me who am overwhelmed by sorrow; and the
  cuckoo, speaking as though in delight, seems to call me.”
'24': >-
  “This delighted dātyūha bird, sounding out beside the lovely forest-stream,
  will make me—who am seized by passion—lament, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'25': >-
  “Formerly, on hearing this bird’s call, my beloved, dwelling in the hermitage,
  would summon me and, rejoicing, would be supremely delighted.”
'26': >-
  “Thus these wondrous birds of many kinds, crying out with varied calls—behold
  the trees, shrubs, and creepers all around, filled with them as they alight.”
'27': >-
  “The birds are mingled—males with females—pleased with their own formations;
  gladdened like the bhṛṅgarāja, sweet-voiced, O Saumitri.”
'28': >-
  “On this bank, the birds here, in flocks and rejoicing, cry out—with the
  amorous calls of dātyūhas and also with the notes of male cuckoos.”
'29': >-
  “And these trees resound—kindling my love—like the ashoka whose clusters are
  as glowing coals, with the buzzing hum of bees.”
'30': >-
  “This spring-fire, with its reddish flame of tender shoots, will surely
  consume me; for I do not behold her—the fine-lashed, dark-haired lady of
  gentle speech.”
'31': >-
  “For me, who do not see her, Saumitri, life has no purpose; for this is her
  delightful season and this is the delightful forest-time.”
'32': >-
  “This spring, with its borders crowded with cuckoos, O sinless one, for my
  beloved, arises from the exertion of Kāma and is heightened by the qualities
  of spring.”
'33': >-
  “This sorrow-fire will quickly burn me, as though before long—when I do not
  see that woman, even while I behold these lovely trees.”
'34': >-
  “This sorrow, born of my own self, will come upon me again and again; Vaidehī,
  unseen, increases my grief here.”
'35': >-
  “And springtime, seen, taints me with the contact of sweat; she—my
  doe-fawn-eyed one—has brought me under the force of anxiety and grief.”
'36': >-
  “O Saumitri, the cruel forest-breeze of Caitra torments me; and there peacocks
  appear, dancing here and there.”
'37': >-
  “With their wings lifted by the wind like crystal windows, surrounded by
  peahens—those peacocks, intoxicated, are as though in a swoon.”
'38': >-
  “Though I am afflicted by Kāma, these are increasers of Kāma—behold, Lakṣmaṇa:
  the peahen dances, and the peacock dances after her.”
'39': >-
  “This peahen, distressed by love, turns toward her mate on the mountain-slope;
  and the peacock too follows only her—his Rāmā—in his mind.”
'40': >-
  “Spreading out his lovely wings, and with his cries as though mocking—surely
  in this forest the peacock’s beloved has not been carried off by a rākṣasa.”
'41': >-
  “Therefore he dances in delightful forests along with his mate; but for me,
  dwelling without her in the flower-month is utterly unbearable.”
'42': >-
  “Behold, Lakṣmaṇa, passion exists even among those born in animal wombs—since
  this peahen, out of desire, approaches her mate.”
'43': >-
  “So too would my wide-eyed Jānakī, stirred with longing, approach me through
  the power of Love—if she had not been abducted.”
'44': >-
  “Behold, Lakṣmaṇa: for me flowers become fruitless, when the cold season has
  ended and the forests are rich with the weight of blossoms.”
'45': >-
  “Even the lovely, exceedingly splendid flowers of the trees fall upon the
  earth as though fruitless—along with swarms of bees.”
'46': >-
  “In flocks the birds, delighted, cry out sweetly at will, as if calling to one
  another—driving me mad with love.”
'47': >-
  “If spring exists even there where my beloved dwells, then surely Sītā, under
  another’s power, grieves as I grieve.”
'48': >-
  “Surely spring does not touch that region where she is; for how could she—the
  dark-lotus-eyed one—live without me?”
'49': >-
  “Or else spring does prevail there where my beloved is; yet what will that
  fair-hipped lady do, when she is rebuked and abused by others?”
'50': >-
  “My beloved is dark-hued, lotus-leaf-eyed, and gentle-spoken; surely, on the
  coming of spring, she will abandon her life.”
'51': >-
  “Indeed my resolve in my heart turns over and over firmly: Sītā, the chaste
  one, is not able to endure separation from me.”
'52': >-
  “Vaidehī’s love is truly fixed in me; and my love too is in every way fixed in
  Sītā.”
'53': >-
  “This flower-bearing breeze, pleasant to the touch and cool, for me—who think
  upon my beloved—becomes like fire.”
'54': >-
  “I used to consider that wind always delightful when I was formerly with Sītā;
  but that same breeze, without Sītā, now produces sorrow in me.”
'55': >-
  “And without her, even that bird—then—cries out: a crow perched on a tree
  calls loudly in exhilaration.”
'56': >-
  “This bird is indeed there as Vaidehī’s messenger; it will bring me near to my
  wide-eyed lady.”
'57': >-
  “Behold, Lakṣmaṇa, the clamor in the forest that increases my passion—the
  chirping of birds upon the flowering tree-tops.”
'58': >-
  “To this tilaka flower-cluster, scattered by the wind, a bee suddenly
  comes—like a lover hastening to a beloved stirred by intoxication.”
'59': >-
  “For lovers this aśoka tree, though named ‘griefless,’ becomes one that
  increases grief—standing as if threatening me with clusters tossed up by the
  wind.”
'60': >-
  “These mango trees, Lakṣmaṇa, are seen full of blossoms—like men whose minds
  are excited by amorous sport and who are colored with passion.”
'61': >-
  “Saumitri, look: in the wondrous forest-stretches of Pampa, kiṃnaras wander
  here and there, O tiger among men.”
'62': >-
  “Look, Lakṣmaṇa, on every side: these lotuses of auspicious fragrance shine in
  the water like the young sun.”
'63': >-
  “This is Pampa with her clear waters, with lotuses and blue water-lilies,
  thronged with swans and kāraṇḍavas, and endowed with the fragrance of
  saugandhika lotuses.”
'64': >-
  “In the water Pampa is adorned, surrounded on every side with lotuses whose
  sheen is like the young sun, their filaments struck by bees.”
'65': >-
  “Ever accompanied by cakravāka birds, with forests in the intervals of her
  variegated plateaus, she is beautified also by herds of elephants and deer
  seeking water.”
'66': >-
  “In the spotless water, with waves whose speed is driven by the wind, the
  lotuses shine as they are buffeted, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'67': >-
  “For me, who do not behold Vaidehī—she of lotus-petal-wide eyes, ever fond of
  dear lotuses—life is not pleasing.”
'68': >-
  “Ah, the perversity of Kāma—he who will make me remember that auspicious lady,
  hard to attain even though she is gone, she whose words are more auspicious
  still.”
'69': >-
  “Desire could be borne by me, once it has arisen—if only spring, with its
  blossoming trees, would not strike me again and again.”
'70': >-
  “Those very things that were delightful for me when they were with her—those
  become undelightful for me without her.”
'71': >-
  “These lotus-bud petals—my sight thinks them like Sītā’s eyelids, O Lakṣmaṇa,
  resembling the corners of her eyes.”
'72': >-
  “This enchanting breeze, coming out from between trees and mingled with
  lotus-filaments, blows like Sītā’s very breath.”
'73': >-
  “Saumitri, look on Pampa’s southern mountain-slopes: the staff-like stem of
  the karṇikāra in bloom, most splendid.”
'74': >-
  “This lordly mountain, adorned with minerals, casts forth wondrous pollen,
  struck and scattered by the force of the wind.”
'75': >-
  “The mountain ridges, Saumitri, everywhere are in full bloom; with leafless,
  altogether lovely kiṃśuka trees, they blaze as though lit up.”
'76': >-
  “And these trees upon Pampa’s bank, well sprinkled, fragrant with
  honey—mālatī, mallikā, lotus, and karavīra—are in bloom.”
'77': >-
  “Ketakī, sinduvāra, and vāsantī are beautifully flowered; and mādhavī, full of
  fragrance, and clusters of kunda as well, on every side.”
'78': >-
  “Ciribilva and madhūka, vañjula and bakula likewise; campaka and tilaka, and
  nāga-trees too, are in flower.”
'79': >-
  “Padmaka trees also shine, and blue aśoka trees in bloom; and on the
  mountain-backs, lodhra trees, tawny like a lion’s mane.”
'80': >-
  “Aṅkola and kuraṇṭa, cūrṇaka and pārijāta; mango and pāṭala, and kovidāra as
  well, are in bloom.”
'81': >-
  “Mucukunda and arjuna are seen on the mountain-slopes; and ketaka, uddālaka,
  as well as śirīṣa, śiṃśapā, and dhava.”
'82': >-
  “Śālmali and kiṃśuka too; red kurabaka likewise; tiniśa and naktamāla, and
  sandalwood and syandana likewise.”
'83': >-
  “Hintāla and tilaka too, and nāga-trees in bloom—trees in flower, wrapped
  about by creepers whose tips are in blossom.”
'84': >-
  “Behold here, Saumitri, many lovely trees on Pampa’s shore—these trees with
  boughs tossed by the wind, standing close together as they are.”
'85': >-
  “Creepers follow along from tree to tree like intoxicated noble women—going
  from tree to tree, from mountain to mountain, from forest to forest.”
'86': >-
  “The breeze blows as though delighted by tasting many kinds of nectar-essence;
  and certain trees, abundant in blossoms, are fragrant with honey.”
'87': >-
  “Some, covered with buds, appeared as though dark-hued; as though saying,
  ‘This is delectable, this is sweet, this is fully blossomed,’ as it were.”
'88': >-
  “The bee, reddened with passion, hides itself among the flowers; then, after
  hiding, it springs up again and suddenly goes elsewhere. That bee, greedy for
  honey, moves among the trees upon Pampa’s bank.”
'89': >-
  “This ground, made pleasant, is strewn with heaps of blossoms—like beds and
  couches, as though made of flowers fallen of themselves.”
'90': >-
  “With diverse flowers of many kinds, on those very mountain-slopes, broad
  rock-slabs—yellow and red in hue—have been formed, O Saumitri.”
'91': >-
  “In the end of winter, see, Saumitri, the arising of blossoms on the trees;
  for in the flower-month the trees blossom as though from mutual friction.”
'92': >-
  “The mountains, resounding with the hum of bees, seem as though they call to
  one another; their branches, adorned with floral crowns, shine greatly, O
  Lakṣmaṇa.”
'93': >-
  “This kāraṇḍava bird, plunging into the auspicious water, sports along with
  his mate, as though kindling desire.”
'94': >-
  “As for Mandākinī—such is her charming beauty; rightly are her delightful
  qualities famed throughout the world.”
'95': >-
  “If only that chaste lady could be seen, and if we could dwell here—then I
  would not covet Indra’s heaven, nor even Ayodhyā, O best of the Raghu line.”
'96': >-
  “For if I were sporting with her on such delightful grassy meadows, no anxiety
  would arise in me, nor would there be desire for other things.”
'97': >-
  “These trees of many hues, with flowers of diverse kinds, in this
  woodland—without my beloved—produce anxiety in me.”
'98': >-
  “Behold, Saumitri, this cool-watered lake full of lotuses, frequented by
  cakravāka birds and resorted to by kāraṇḍavas.”
'99': >-
  “Filled with plavas and krauñcas, visited by great beasts, Pampa shines all
  the more with birds calling out.”
'100': >-
  “These diverse, joyous birds seem to kindle my love, as I remember my
  beloved—dark-hued, moon-faced, lotus-eyed.”
'101': >-
  “See, on the variegated slopes, deer accompanied by does—moving here and
  there—seem to afflict my heart again, for I am made bereft of Vaidehī, the
  doe-fawn-eyed one.”
'102': >-
  “On this lovely mountain-slope, filled with flocks of intoxicated birds—if I
  could see that beloved, then there would be well-being for me.”
'103': >-
  “Surely I would live, Saumitri, if Vaidehī, the slender-waisted one, would
  enjoy with me the auspicious breeze of Pampa.”
'104': >-
  “Bearing the fragrance of lotuses and saugandhikas, auspicious and a destroyer
  of grief—blessed indeed are those, Lakṣmaṇa, who enjoy the forest-breeze of
  Pampa.”
'105': >-
  “My beloved—dark-hued, lotus-leaf-eyed—is separated from me; how does Janaka’s
  daughter, helpless, sustain her life-breaths?”
'106': >-
  “What shall I say in the assembly of people to that knower of dharma, that
  truth-speaking king Janaka, when he asks after Sītā’s welfare?”
'107': >-
  “Sītā—who followed me when I was sent forth by my father to the forest,
  meekly, upholding dharma—where now does that beloved dwell?”
'108': >-
  “Bereft of her, wretched as I am, how shall I endure, Lakṣmaṇa—she who
  followed me when I was fallen from the kingdom and my mind was shattered?”
'109': >-
  “Not beholding her face—beautiful with lotus-eyes, fragrant, auspicious, and
  unblemished—my understanding seems to sink.”
'110': >-
  “That incomparable speech of Vaidehī—mixed with smiles and laughter, possessed
  of virtue, sweet, and wholesome—when shall I hear it, O Lakṣmaṇa?”
'111': >-
  “Having come to hardship in the forest, that dark-hued chaste lady, seeing me
  drawn by Love, spoke as though her own grief were gone—cheerful, even
  delighted.”
'112': >-
  “What shall I say in Ayodhyā to Kauśalyā, O prince—when that high-minded lady
  asks, ‘Where is that daughter-in-law?’”
'113': >-
  “Go, Lakṣmaṇa—go and see Bharata, who is devoted to his brothers; for I am not
  able to live without Janaka’s daughter.”
'114': >-
  Thus, while the great-souled Rāma lamented like one without refuge, his
  brother Lakṣmaṇa spoke to him words that were fitting and sound.
'115': >-
  “Compose yourself, Rāma; well-being to you. Grieve not, O best of men. Such a
  dullness of mind does not befit those whose selves are stainless.”
'116': >-
  “Remembering the pain born of separation, abandon excessive clinging to the
  beloved. For even a wet wick is burned by the close embrace of too much
  flame.”
'117': >-
  “Even if he goes down into Pātāla, or even beyond it—Rāvaṇa will in no manner
  remain alive, O Rāghava.”
'118': >-
  “First let us obtain intelligence and tidings of that sinful rākṣasa; then
  either he will restore Sītā, or he will go to his destruction.”
'119': >-
  “Even if Rāvaṇa, along with Sītā, enters into the womb of Diti (the nethermost
  region), there too I shall slay him—if he does not give up Maithilī.”
'120': >-
  “Abide in health and well-being, noble sir; let this wretched disposition be
  cast aside. A purpose whose means are lost is not gained without effort.”
'121': >-
  “Energy, noble sir, is powerful—there is no strength greater than energy. For
  one who possesses energy, nothing at all is difficult to attain in the
  worlds.”
'122': >-
  “Men of energy do not sink in undertakings. Relying on energy alone, we shall
  regain Jānakī.”
'123': >-
  “Let the tendency to be ruled by desire be abandoned; casting sorrow behind
  you, do you not recognize your own self—great-souled and self-mastered?”
'124': >-
  Thus addressed by him, Rāma—whose mind was struck by grief—abandoning sorrow
  and delusion, attained firmness and composure.
'125': >-
  Then Rāma, of inconceivable prowess and now unconfused, passed beyond that
  exceedingly lovely and delightful Pampa, adorned with trees along her banks.
'126': >-
  Beholding at once the entire forest—its cascades and its caverns—this
  great-souled one, though with an agitated mind and afflicted by sorrow, set
  forth after deliberation, together with Lakṣmaṇa.
'127': >-
  As that great-souled Rāghava went, moving with the graceful gait of an
  intoxicated elephant and with mind untroubled, Lakṣmaṇa—whose conduct was dear
  to him—protected him with righteousness and with strength as well.
'128': >-
  As they moved near Ṛṣyamūka, Sugrīva, the mighty lord of the monkeys, beheld
  those two wondrous and most sightly ones; and he became afraid, and did not
  move, and ceased his intended actions.
'129': >-
  That great monkey, moving with the slow gait of an elephant, while roaming
  there, on seeing those two as they wandered, fell into deep dejection—beset by
  anxious thought and broken by the burden of fear.
'130': >-
  Seeing those two—Rāghava and Lakṣmaṇa—of great splendor, the monkeys,
  frightened, approached that hermitage which was holy, pleasant, and a refuge,
  and whose precincts were ever frequented by monkeys.
'131': >-
  Thus ends the first chapter, named “Rāma’s Entrancement in the Delusion of
  Separation,” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primeval epic.
