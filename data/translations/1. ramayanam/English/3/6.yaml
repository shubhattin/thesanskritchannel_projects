  Now begins the sixth sarga of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Vow to Slay the Rākṣasas.”
'1': >-
  When Śarabhanga had attained heaven, hosts of sages assembled and approached
  Kakutstha—Rāma of blazing splendour.
'2': >-
  There were Vaikhānasas and Vālakhilyas, the well-purified ascetics, the
  followers of Marīci; many were those who lived by grinding stones, and others
  who subsisted only on leaves—men of austerity.
'3': >-
  Some had their teeth as their mortar and pestle; likewise others were those
  who plunged into water repeatedly; some made their own bodies their couch,
  others lay on no bed at all; and some never granted themselves any leisure.
'4': >-
  There were sages who lived only on water, and others who fed on air; some
  dwelt in the open sky, and others slept upon bare ground.
'5': >-
  So too there were the restrained ones who remained standing with arms
  upraised; likewise those clothed in damp garments; those engaged in japa,
  those steadfast in tapas, and those practising the fivefold austerity.
'6': >-
  All of them, endowed with brahmanic splendour and firmly established in yoga
  and deep concentration, came—those ascetics—to Rāma at Śarabhanga’s hermitage.
'7': >-
  Having approached Rāma—knower of dharma, the foremost among those who uphold
  dharma—the assembled company of sages spoke to him, who was supremely versed
  in dharma:
'8': >-
  “You are the great chariot-warrior of this Ikṣvāku line and of the whole
  earth; you are also the foremost lord and protector—like Maghavān (Indra)
  among the gods.
'9': >-
  Renowned in the three worlds for fame and for valour, you possess true
  devotion to your father’s vow, and in you dharma abides in fullness.
'10': >-
  “Having reached you, the great-souled one—knower of dharma and tender toward
  dharma—O lord, we shall speak as supplicants; please bear with us for that.
'11': >-
  Great would be the unrighteousness of that king, O lord, O ruler of men, who
  takes the sixth share of offerings (taxes/tribute) and yet does not protect
  his subjects as a son.
'12': >-
  Striving as though their lives were his own—cherishing them with his very life
  as though they were beloved sons—ever vigilant and always protecting all who
  dwell in his realm,
'13': >-
  such a one, O Rāma, attains enduring renown through many years; and, reaching
  the station of Brahmā, is honoured there as well.
'14': >-
  Whatever supreme dharma a sage who lives on roots and fruits performs, of that
  a king obtains one-fourth, provided he protects his subjects in accordance
  with dharma.
'15': >-
  “But this great multitude of forest-dwelling ascetics—mostly brahmins—though
  having you as their lord, O Rāma, are being violently slain by rākṣasas, as if
  they had no protector.
'16': >-
  Come, behold the bodies of many sages—men of disciplined and purified
  selves—slain in diverse ways in the forest by dreadful rākṣasas.
'17': >-
  A great devastation is being wrought upon the dwellers by the Pampā river,
  along the Mandākinī as well, and upon those who reside at Citrakūṭa.
'18': >-
  Thus we cannot endure the persecution of the ascetics—the dreadful havoc
  wrought in the forest by rākṣasas of fearsome deeds.
'19': >-
  Therefore we have approached you, the refuge of those who seek refuge. Protect
  us, O Rāma, who are being slain by the night-rangers.
'20': >-
  For us, O hero, no higher recourse upon earth is possible apart from you.
  Protect all of us from the rākṣasas, O prince.
'21': >-
  Hearing this from those tapasvins, Kakutstha, righteous-souled, spoke these
  words to all the ascetics:
'22': >-
  “You should not speak to me in this manner; I am one to be commanded by
  ascetics. For my part, I entered the forest solely for my own purpose.
'23': >-
  Yet I have entered this forest in obedience to my father’s command, in order
  to drive away this persecution of you by the rākṣasas.
'24': >-
  I have come here, as it so happened, for the fulfilment of your need;
  therefore my dwelling in this forest will bring great fruit.
'25': >-
  I desire to slay the rākṣasas—enemies in battle—for the sake of the ascetics.
  Let the sages, rich in austerity, behold my prowess—together with my brother.
'26': >-
  Thus, the hero—steadfast in dharma—having granted the boon (assurance) of
  these austerity-rich sages, and accompanied by Lakṣmaṇa, proceeded with those
  tapasvins, and came indeed to Sūtīkṣṇa.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the sixth sarga of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the venerable, glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Vow to Slay the
  Rākṣasas.”
