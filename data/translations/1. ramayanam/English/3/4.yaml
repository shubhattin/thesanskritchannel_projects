  Now, in the revered Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the Fourth
  Sarga, entitled “The Burial of Virādha.”
'1': >-
  But seeing Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa of the Raghu line being carried off, Sītā—seizing
  hold of those two mighty-armed heroes—cried aloud in a piercing voice.
'2': >-
  “This is Rāma, son of Daśaratha—truthful, of noble conduct, and pure—who,
  along with Lakṣmaṇa, is being borne away by a rākṣasa of dreadful form!”
'3': >-
  “Bears will devour me; and tigers and leopards likewise will eat me! Leave me
  behind and carry away the two Kakutsthas. Salutations to you, O best of
  rākṣasas!”
'4': >-
  Hearing those words of Vaidehī, the two heroes Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa swiftly set
  their effort toward the slaying of that wicked-souled being.
'5': >-
  Against that fierce one, Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) shattered the left arm; and Rāma,
  with great force, broke the right arm of that rākṣasa.
'6': >-
  His arms broken, agitated and bewildered, he at once fell down senseless upon
  the earth—cloud-like in aspect, like a mountain cloven by a thunderbolt.
'7': >-
  Then, striking the rākṣasa with fists, arms, and feet, and repeatedly lifting
  and dashing him down, they crushed him upon the ground.
'8': >-
  Though pierced by many arrows and hewn by their swords, and though crushed
  again and again upon the earth, that rākṣasa did not die.
'9': >-
  Beholding him—most exceedingly unkillable, like an immovable
  mountain—illustrious Rāma, the giver of fearlessness amidst perils, spoke
  these words:
'10': >-
  “O tiger among men, because of austerities this rākṣasa cannot be overcome in
  battle by weapons. Let us bury this rākṣasa.”
'11': >-
  “O Lakṣmaṇa, for this fierce rākṣasa—terrible like a raging elephant—dig here
  in this forest a very large pit, for one of dreadful radiance.”
'12': >-
  Having thus spoken to Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma said, “Let the cleft (the pit) be dug,”
  and, full of valor, stood pressing down Virādha, setting his foot upon the
  rākṣasa’s throat.
'13': >-
  Hearing what Rāghava had said, the rākṣasa—speaking in a subdued
  voice—addressed Kakutstha, Virādha speaking to that bull among men:
'14': >-
  “I am slain, O tiger among men, by one whose strength is indeed equal to
  Indra’s. In delusion, however, I did not earlier recognize you, O best of
  men.”
'15': >-
  “You are Rāma, son of Kauśalyā, blessed with noble offspring, dear one—thus
  are you known to me; and Vaidehī, most fortunate; and Lakṣmaṇa, of great
  renown.”
'16': >-
  “Through a terrible curse I entered into a rākṣasa body. I am the Gandharva
  named Tumburu, cursed indeed by Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera).”
'17': >-
  “And when I sought to propitiate him, that great-glorious one said to me:
  ‘When Rāma, son of Daśaratha, shall slay you in battle,’”
'18': >-
  “‘Then you will return to your own natural state and go to heaven.’ Being
  unappeased by me, he, angered, spoke thus.”
'19': >-
  “Thus did King Vaiśravaṇa speak—to one attached to Rambhā. By your grace I am
  freed from that exceedingly dreadful curse.”
'20': >-
  “I shall go to my own world. May welfare be yours, O scorcher of foes. Not far
  from here dwells the righteous-souled and mighty Śarabhanga, possessed of
  great splendor.”
'21': >-
  “At a distance of one and a half yojanas, dear one, is that great seer,
  radiant like the sun. Go quickly to him; he will declare to you what is for
  your highest good.”
'22': >-
  “And, O Rāma, having cast me into the pit, go on in safety. This is the
  eternal ordinance concerning rākṣasas whose life-breath has departed.”
'23': >-
  “For those who are placed in a pit, their worlds are everlasting.” Thus
  speaking to Kakutstha, Virādha—afflicted by arrows—
'24': >-
  attained heaven; his body laid aside, though of mighty strength. Hearing those
  words, Rāghava then instructed Lakṣmaṇa:
'25': >-
  “O Lakṣmaṇa, for this fierce rākṣasa—terrible like a raging elephant—dig here
  in this forest a very large pit for him of dreadful deeds.”
'26': >-
  Having thus spoken to Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma said, “Let the cleft (the pit) be dug,”
  and, full of valor, stood pressing down Virādha, setting his foot upon the
  rākṣasa’s throat.
'27': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, taking a digging tool, dug an excellent pit at the side of that
  great-souled Virādha.
'28': >-
  Lifting up Virādha—tawny-eared, huge-roaring, with his throat free—he cast him
  into the pit, even as he cried out with a dreadful sound.
'29': >-
  In battle, those two steadfast and swift-acting ones, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa,
  lifted up with strength that fearsome rākṣasa who was roaring, and, rejoicing,
  hurled him down.
'30': >-
  Seeing that mighty asura to be unkillable, those two bulls among men, skilled
  exceedingly and fully equal to the task, contrived the slaying of Virādha by
  means of casting him into the pit.
'31': >-
  Indeed, by Virādha himself was the manner of his own death, as truly desired,
  forcibly disclosed to Rāma—the forest-dweller himself declaring: “My death
  will not be wrought by weapons.”
'32': >-
  Hearing those very words spoken by him, Rāma resolved upon his being made to
  enter the pit; and as that exceedingly strong rākṣasa was being thrust into
  it, the forest resounded.
'33': >-
  Then Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, their faces as if radiant with delight, having felled
  Virādha into the cleft in the earth, rejoiced in that great forest, their fear
  dispelled, and covered over the rākṣasa within with rocks.
'34': >-
  Then those two, bearers of golden, beautifully adorned bows, having slain that
  rākṣasa and taking Maithilī with them, wandered joyfully in the great
  forest—like the Moon and the Sun stationed in the sky.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the Fourth Sarga, named “The Burial of Virādha,” in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa
  of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
