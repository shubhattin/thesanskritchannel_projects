  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the fortieth chapter,
  called “The Resolve concerning the Assumption of the Form of the Illusory
  Deer.”
'1': >-
  But Rāvaṇa, to whom that speech of Mārīca was fitting and well-reasoned, did
  not accept it—like a man desirous of death refusing a healing medicine.
'2': >-
  Then the lord of the rākṣasas addressed Mārīca, that speaker of wholesome and
  beneficial counsel, with harsh words—unreasonable, impelled as he was by Time.
'3': >-
  “O Mārīca, why is this improper, base, and ill-purposed speech spoken to
  me—utterly fruitless, like seed sown in barren soil?
'4': >-
  “By your words I cannot be made to turn back from battle with Rāma—especially
  with that foolish, sinful-natured mere man.
'5': >-
  “He who, abandoning friends, kingdom, and also mother and father, upon hearing
  the commonplace words of a woman, went to the forest in a single step—
'6': >-
  “Surely, in your very presence, I must carry off Sītā—dearer to him than
  life-breath—him who is the slayer of Khara, in the midst of conflict.
'7': >-
  “Thus, Mārīca, this resolve is fixed in my heart; it cannot be turned back
  even by gods and asuras, even with Indra among them.
'8': >-
  “When asked about fault or merit, you ought to speak in such a
  manner—regarding the danger or the means, in deciding this undertaking.
'9': >-
  “But a discerning counsellor, if he desires his own welfare, should speak only
  when questioned—standing with joined palms before the king.
'10': >-
  “And the lord of the earth should be addressed with words that are not
  adverse—gentle in the first place, auspicious, beneficial, and proper, spoken
  with due courtesy.
'11': >-
  “But a king who seeks honor would not commend speech that is contemptuous—even
  if it is said to be ‘for one’s good’—for such speech is devoid of respect.
'12': >-
  “Kings of immeasurable might assume five forms: of Fire, of Indra, of Soma, of
  Yama, and of Varuṇa.
'13': >-
  “Heat, valor, gentleness, punishment, and graciousness—these great-souled
  kings bear, O ranger of the night.
'14': >-
  “Therefore, in all conditions they are ever to be honored and revered; but
  you, not understanding dharma, cling only to delusion.
'15': >-
  “And through your wickedness you speak such harsh words to one who has
  approached you. I do not ask about your merits and faults, nor do I ask about
  your own safety, O rākṣasa.
'16': >-
  “Even this much has been spoken by me to you, O you of boundless prowess; now,
  in this matter you ought to render assistance to me.”
'17': >-
  “Hear, then, what task you must do for me as aid: becoming a golden deer,
  variegated with silver spots—
'18': >-
  “Roam in front of Sītā, at the hermitage of that Rāma; having enticed the
  princess of Videha, you may then go wherever you please.
'19': >-
  “For when Maithilī, marveling, beholds you—golden and made by illusion—she
  will quickly say to Rāma, ‘Bring that one.’”
'20': >-
  “And when the son of Kakutstha has gone away, even after going far, cry out,
  ‘Ha, Sītā! Ha, Lakṣmaṇa!’—in a manner befitting Rāma’s voice.
'21': >-
  “Hearing that, and urged on by Sītā to follow Rāma’s track, even Saumitrī will
  go after him in agitation, out of affection.
'22': >-
  “And when the son of Kakutstha has gone away, and Lakṣmaṇa too—then, at my
  ease, I shall carry off the princess of Videha, as the thousand-eyed Indra
  carried off Śacī.
'23': >-
  “Having thus done this task, go wherever you desire, O rākṣasa; I shall give
  you half the kingdom, O Mārīca, you of good observances.
'24': >-
  “Go, gentle one—may the path be auspicious—for the fulfillment of this
  undertaking. I shall follow you, mounted on my chariot, to the Daṇḍaka forest.
'25': >-
  “Having obtained Sītā without battle, and having deceived Rāghava, I shall go
  toward Laṅkā—successful in purpose—together with you.”
'26': >-
  “If you do not do this, O Mārīca, I shall slay you this very day. This task I
  shall accomplish without fail, even by force. One who stands contrary to a
  king never prospers in happiness.”
'27': >-
  “Having come to oppose me, your life is in doubt; indeed, death is certain for
  you today if you contend with me. Therefore, having duly weighed this with
  your understanding, do here what is wholesome—do so accordingly.”
'28': >-
  Thus ends the fortieth chapter of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “The Resolve concerning the Assumption of
  the Form of the Illusory Deer.”
