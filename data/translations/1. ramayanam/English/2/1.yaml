  Now begins the first chapter, named “The Resolve for Rama’s Consecration,” in
  the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  When Bharata, O sinless one, had gone to his maternal uncle’s household,
  Śatrughna—ever the slayer of foes—was taken along with him, with affection set
  foremost (as the motive).
'2': >-
  There he dwelt together with his brother, honoured and duly received; and by
  his maternal uncle, the lord of horses (Aśvapati), he was cherished with a
  father’s fondness.
'3': >-
  Even while they lived there, and were gratified in every way as they wished,
  the two heroic brothers—remembering—kept thinking of the aged king Daśaratha.
'4': >-
  And the mighty king too remembered his two absent sons, Bharata and
  Śatrughna—both like Indra and Varuṇa.
'5': >-
  Indeed, all four of his sons, those best of men, were dear to him—like four
  arms, as it were, sprung forth from his own body.
'6': >-
  And among them, the great and radiant Rāma was the delight of his father; like
  the Self-born Creator among beings, he excelled in virtues.
'7': >-
  For, sought by the gods—who, being afflicted by Rāvaṇa, desired his
  slaying—eternal Viṣṇu was born in the world of men.
'8': >-
  Kauśalyā shone resplendent by that son of immeasurable splendour, even as
  Aditi among the gods by her boon—Vajrapāṇi (Indra).
'9': >-
  He was endowed with beauty, possessed of valour, free from envy; on earth he
  was an incomparable son, in virtues like Daśaratha.
'10': >-
  And he was ever of tranquil soul, and spoke gently; even when addressed
  harshly, he returned no harsh reply.
'11': >-
  At times he was satisfied by a single service rendered; but, by his
  self-restraint, he did not remember even a hundred injuries.
'12': >-
  Conversing always with the good—those advanced in conduct, advanced in
  knowledge, and advanced in age—he would remain (with them) even during
  intervals between exercises in the use of weapons.
'13': >-
  Wise, sweet of speech, speaking first (with courtesy), pleasant in
  utterance—valiant, yet not made proud or astonished by his own great prowess.
'14': >-
  And he spoke no falsehood; learned, a reverent honourer of elders; beloved of
  the subjects, and the subjects too were devoted to him.
'15': >-
  Compassionate, having conquered anger, a venerater of brāhmaṇas; sympathetic
  to the distressed, knower of dharma, ever self-controlled, and pure.
'16': >-
  His understanding conformed to his lineage; he greatly esteemed the kṣatriya’s
  own duty, and, with highest joy, regarded it as bearing the great fruit of
  heaven.
'17': >-
  Not intent upon what is unwholesome, nor fond of talk that is opposed (to
  propriety); he spoke ever higher and higher reasonings, like Bṛhaspati
  himself.
'18': >-
  Free from illness, youthful, eloquent, handsome, knower of place and time; in
  the world he knew the essence of men—one perfected as a noble person.
'19': >-
  That prince, the king’s son, endowed with the best of qualities, became dear
  to the people by his virtues—like the vital breath moving outside (the body),
  indispensable to all.
'20': >-
  Having bathed (i.e., been fully trained) in all branches of learning,
  accomplished in vows and disciplines, knowing the Vedas with their limbs in
  proper manner, he surpassed his father in archery and the science of
  missiles—the elder brother of Bharata.
'21': >-
  Of auspicious lineage, virtuous, not mean-spirited, truthful in speech and
  straightforward; he was well trained by aged brāhmaṇas who perceived dharma
  and artha.
'22': >-
  Knowing the true principles of dharma, kāma, and artha; possessed of retentive
  memory and brilliance; in worldly conventions and customary conduct he was
  well instructed and skilful.
'23': >-
  Reserved, restrained in outward demeanour, keeping counsel secret, supported
  by allies; unerring in wrath and in joy (never misplacing either), and knowing
  the proper time for renunciation and for restraint.
'24': >-
  Of firm devotion, of steady understanding; not taking up what is base, not
  harsh of speech; free from sloth, vigilant, and knowing both his own faults
  and others’.
'25': >-
  Knowing the śāstras and grateful, skilled in discerning the inner nature of
  men; judicious, according to justice, in both restraint and favour.
'26': >-
  Skilled in winning and showing favour to the good, and in punishing—knowing
  place and occasion for restraint; knowing the means in matters of revenue, and
  understanding expenditure as well as action.
'27': >-
  Having attained excellence in assemblies of weapons, and also in mixed and
  complex encounters; embracing both artha and dharma, governing with ease, and
  not indolent.
'28': >-
  In sportive arts and crafts he knew the divisions and their purposes; and in
  mounting and in training he was adept with elephants and horses.
'29': >-
  Foremost among those who know the science of the bow; in the world renowned as
  an atiratha (a peerless chariot-warrior); an assailant and a smiter, and well
  skilled in the leading of armies.
'30': >-
  Unassailable in battle even by gods and asuras when enraged; free from envy,
  having conquered anger; neither arrogant nor jealous.
'31': >-
  Not to be despised by any creature, nor one who submits to the sway of Time;
  thus the prince, endowed with the best of qualities, (stood among) the people.
'32': >-
  Approved in the three worlds; by forbearance like the Earth herself; in
  intellect equal to Bṛhaspati, and in prowess also to the lord of Śacī (Indra).
'33': >-
  Thus, by all those qualities—dear to all subjects, producing affection in his
  father—Rāma shone forth, blazing like the sun with his rays.
'34': >-
  The earth desired such a lord—endowed with such conduct and excellence, of
  irresistible might—like the protector of the world itself.
'35': >-
  Beholding that son endowed with many incomparable virtues, King Daśaratha,
  scorcher of foes, fell into deep reflection.
'36': >-
  Then to that aged king, long-lived, this very joy arose: “How may Rāma become
  king while I yet live?”
'37': >-
  For this supreme delight of his kept turning within his heart: “When indeed
  shall I see my beloved son consecrated?”
'38': >-
  Desirous of the world’s prosperity, compassionate to all beings—more dear to
  the world than I, like a rain-bearing cloud.
'39': >-
  Equal to Yama and Indra in prowess, equal to Bṛhaspati in counsel; equal to a
  mountain in steadfastness, and superior to me in virtues.
'40': >-
  “May I attain heaven, as it were, having seen my son, at this very age, ruling
  this entire great earth.”
'41': >-
  Thus, by such varied qualities—rare even among other kings—refined,
  immeasurable, and in the world surpassing worldly measure,
'42': >-
  Having then examined him—fitting, endowed with amassed virtues—the king,
  having decided together with his ministers, resolved upon the installation in
  the office of heir-apparent (yuvarāja).
'43': >-
  And that wise king perceived fearsome portents in the divine sky, in the
  mid-region, and upon the earth—and he perceived old age in his own body as
  well.
'44': >-
  Then he understood the great-souled Rāma’s exceeding belovedness in the
  world—of him whose face was like the full moon, and who dispelled his (the
  king’s) sorrow.
'45': >-
  For the welfare of himself and of his subjects, and out of love as well, when
  the proper time had come, that righteous king hastened with devotion (to act).
'46': >-
  Men dwelling in many cities, and also distinct inhabitants of the
  countryside—leaders—did the lord of the earth summon together on the land.
'47': >-
  The king, adorned, beheld them—honoured according to their worth with diverse
  garments and ornaments—like Prajāpati beholding his creatures.
'48': >-
  But the king did not, in haste, send for the Kekaya king, nor for Janaka;
  afterwards those two would hear the pleasing matter.
'49': >-
  Then, when that king—the crusher of hostile cities—had taken his seat, the
  remaining kings, honoured by the world, entered.
'50': >-
  And when various seats had been assigned by the king, the kings sat down,
  disciplined and facing the king alone.
'51': >-
  Surrounded by kings endowed with honour and humility, and by men from cities
  and countryside seated near him, the lord of men shone forth—like the Blessed
  Thousand-eyed (Indra) amid the immortals.
'52': >-
  Thus ends the first chapter, named “The Resolve for Rama’s Consecration,” in
  the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
