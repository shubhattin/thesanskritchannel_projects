  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-ninth sarga, called “The Capturing of Vāsava (Indra).”
'1': >-
  Then, when darkness had set in, all those Devas and Rākṣasas, maddened with
  the force of battle, fought on, slaying one another.
'2': >-
  Thereafter, by the army of the Gods, a great host of the Rākṣasas—one tenth of
  it—was stood up against in the battle, and the remainder was sent to the abode
  of Yama (to destruction).
'3': >-
  And in that battle of darkness, all those Devas and Rākṣasas, while fighting
  each other, could not recognize one another.
'4': >-
  Yet Indra, and Rāvaṇa, and the mighty Rāvaṇi (Meghanāda/Indrajit)—those three
  did not fall into delusion, though that place was covered with a net of
  darkness.
'5': >-
  But Rāvaṇa, seeing in an instant all his forces struck down, was seized by
  fierce wrath, and he uttered a mighty roar.
'6': >-
  In anger, the unassailable one spoke to his charioteer, who stood upon the
  chariot: “Drive me, right through the midst of the enemy host, until we reach
  its far end.”
'7': >-
  “Today, I myself, by my prowess in battle, with many kinds of exceedingly
  dreadful weapons, shall send all these gods to Yama’s dwelling.”
'8': >-
  “I shall slay Indra, and Kubera the Lord of Wealth, and Varuṇa, and Yama.
  Having slain the gods, I shall then stand supreme above all. Do not give way
  to despair—quickly drive my chariot!”
'9': >-
  “Indeed, I tell you again and again today: drive me onward until we reach the
  far end (of the enemy ranks).”
'10': >-
  “This is that region of Nandana (Indra’s divine grove) in which we now are.
  Drive me today to that place where the Udaya Mountain stands.”
'11': >-
  Hearing his words, the charioteer, swift as thought, commanded the horses, and
  drove on through the midst of the enemy host.
'12': >-
  Knowing that resolve of his, Śakra, the Lord of the Gods, then—standing on his
  chariot in the very press of battle—spoke these words to the Devas:
'13': >-
  “O Gods, listen to my words, according to what pleases my judgment: let this
  Daśagrīva, that evil Rākṣasa, be seized alive.”
'14': >-
  “For he is of exceeding strength, with armies, and with a chariot swift with
  the speed of the wind; he will advance like the ocean, swelling with high
  waves at the time of the full moon.”
'15': >-
  “Truly, today he cannot be slain, being fearless because of a boon. Therefore
  let us seize the Rākṣasa—this is what becomes you in battle.”
'16': >-
  “Just as, with Bali bound and restrained, the three worlds were enjoyed by me,
  so does the restraining of this sinner commend itself to me.”
'17': >-
  Then Śakra, taking position in another place, abandoning engagement with
  Rāvaṇa, fought on, O King, terrifying the Rākṣasas in battle.
'18': >-
  Daśagrīva pressed in from the northern side, without turning back; but
  Śatakratu (Indra) pressed in from the southern flank.
'19': >-
  Then the lord of the Rākṣasas, having penetrated a hundred yojanas, showered
  down torrents of arrows upon the entire host of the Gods.
'20': >-
  Thereupon Śakra, looking and seeing his own army scattered and lost,
  unperturbed, turned back, surrounding Daśānana (Rāvaṇa).
'21': >-
  In the meantime, a great cry was raised by the Dānavas and Rākṣasas—“Alas, we
  are slain!”—when they saw Rāvaṇa being seized by Śakra.
'22': >-
  Then Rāvaṇi, mounting his chariot, his mind overwhelmed with wrath,
  exceedingly enraged, entered that most dreadful battlefield and host.
'23': >-
  Entering that vast magical display—formerly obtained by the Lord of the
  Cowherds (Indra)—he rushed in, highly inflamed, and charged straight at that
  army.
'24': >-
  Casting aside all the other Devas, he rushed only at Śakra; and Mahendra of
  great splendour did not perceive the enemy’s son (who had come upon him).
'25': >-
  There, though his armour had been torn away, and though he was being struck
  down, Rāvaṇi—of very great valour among the gods—did not yield in the least.
'26': >-
  Striking the approaching Mātali with excellent arrows, he once more covered
  Mahendra with a rain of shafts.
'27': >-
  Then Śakra, abandoning his chariot, dismissed his charioteer, and mounting
  Airāvata, sought after Rāvaṇi.
'28': >-
  Thereupon, possessed of magical power, becoming invisible and moving through
  the sky, he surrounded Indra with illusion and assailed him with arrows.
'29': >-
  And when Rāvaṇi knew Indra to be weary, then, binding him by magic, he led him
  away into the midst of his own army.
'30': >-
  Seeing Mahendra being carried off by him by force from that great battle, all
  the Immortals pondered, “What indeed is to happen now?”
'31': >-
  That magical one—Indrajit, conqueror in battle—was not to be seen; and though
  Indra is learned in arts and powers, by him Indra was borne away by force
  through illusion.
'32': >-
  At that time all the hosts of the Gods, enraged, turning upon Rāvaṇa, poured
  upon him showers of arrows.
'33': >-
  But Rāvaṇa, encountering then the Ādityas and the Vasus, being tormented by
  enemies, could not withstand fighting in that battle.
'34': >-
  Seeing him wearied and faint, shattered and mangled by blows, Rāvaṇi, standing
  within sight in the battle, spoke to his father thus:
'35': >-
  “Come, dear father—let us go; let this act of battle cease. Let it be known to
  you: we have conquered. Be at ease, free from fever (from the heat of
  combat).”
'36': >-
  “For this lord of the gods’ host, the ruler of the three worlds, has been
  seized by the force of destiny; the Gods have had their pride broken.”
'37': >-
  “Enjoy at your pleasure the three worlds, having subdued your enemy by your
  might. Why vainly toil here? Today battle is without fruit.”
'38': >-
  Then those companies of the Gods withdrew from the work of battle; and Rāvaṇa,
  hearing Rāvaṇi’s words, became composed in mind.
'39': >-
  Then the lord of the night-rangers, his fever of battle gone, having attained
  victory, went joyfully toward his own abode; and having regained his son, he
  spoke these words.
'40': >-
  “By exploits like these, of surpassing strength, the honour of my lineage has
  been increased—since today, by you, of unequalled might, the lord of the gods
  and the gods themselves have been conquered.”
'41': >-
  “Mounting him upon the chariot, lead Vāsava (Indra) away; go from here to the
  city, surrounded by the army. And I too, as you go, will swiftly follow behind
  with my ministers.”
'42': >-
  Then that mighty Rāvaṇi, encompassed by forces and with his conveyance, having
  seized the lord of the gods, reached his own abode; and, having accomplished
  the battle, he dismissed the Rākṣasas.
'43': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-ninth sarga in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “The Capturing of Vāsava (Indra).”
