'0': >-
  Now begins the Forty-first Canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Angada’s Embassy (as messenger)”.
'1': >-
  Then, seeing those omens, Rāma—the elder brother of Lakṣmaṇa—embraced Sugrīva
  and spoke these words.
'2': >-
  “Without taking counsel with me, this very act of daring has been done by you.
  Deeds undertaken in such rash daring are not performed by lords of men.”
'3': >-
  “Having placed me in doubt, and this army, and even Vibhīṣaṇa as well—this is
  a grievous deed, O hero, O lover of daring: this rash exploit has been
  committed.”
'4': >-
  “Now, O hero, O crusher of foes, do not act in such a manner. If any harm
  should befall you even slightly, what use would Sītā be to me?”
'5': >-
  “By Bharata, O mighty-armed one; by younger Lakṣmaṇa; and by Śatrughna, O
  slayer of foes—or even by my own body again (i.e., even by my very life)…”
'6': >-
  “This is my settled conviction: that I shall not (take such steps) before you
  have returned. And yet, knowing your valour, O hero—like unto Mahendra and
  Varuṇa—(still I feared).”
'7': >-
  “Having slain Rāvaṇa in battle—together with his sons, his forces, and his
  mounts—and then having anointed Vibhīṣaṇa in Laṅkā as king…
'8': >-
  “…and placing Bharata upon the kingdom, I shall abandon this body, O greatly
  mighty one.” Thus spoke Rāma; and Sugrīva replied to him.
'9': >-
  Sugrīva said: “O Rāghava, having beheld Rāvaṇa, the abductor of your consort,
  how can I, O hero, knowing my own prowess, endure it (without acting)?”
'10': >-
  Thus, praising that hero who spoke so, Rāghava then addressed Lakṣmaṇa—endowed
  with auspicious fortune—with these words:
'11': >-
  “Taking cool water, and (entering) the forests rich with fruit, and
  distributing this massed force (into divisions), let us array (the troops) and
  stand firm, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'12': >-
  “I see a dreadful fear standing near—bringing destruction to the worlds—(a
  conflict) that will be the annihilation of foremost warriors: bears, monkeys,
  and rākṣasas.”
'13': >-
  “For the winds blow harshly, and the earth trembles; the mountain-peaks quake,
  and the very mountains roar.”
'14': >-
  “Clouds, resembling flesh-eaters, harsh and of harsh voice—cruel—rain cruelly,
  mingled with drops of blood.”
'15': >-
  “The twilight is exceedingly terrible, like red sandalwood in hue; and this
  solar orb, as though a circle of fire, burns as it sinks.”
'16': >-
  “Beasts and birds, uttering cries before the sun, produce great fear—wretched,
  of wretched voice, dreadful, inauspicious.”
'17': >-
  “In the night the moon gives no light, and it scorches; its rays are bordered
  with black and red, as at the dissolution of the world.”
'18': >-
  “A small, rough, inauspicious, very red halo is seen; and in the disc of the
  sun a blue mark is visible, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'19': >-
  “The constellations are not seen as they should be; they appear distorted.
  Behold, O Lakṣmaṇa—this portends the world’s end, as it were.”
'20': >-
  “Crows, hawks, and vultures fly low; and jackals too, inauspicious, utter
  cries with loud sound.”
'21': >-
  “With rocks, with spears, and with swords hurled by monkeys and rākṣasas, the
  earth will be covered, a mire of flesh and blood.”
'22': >-
  “Quickly today, surrounded everywhere by the monkeys, let us assail at speed
  that city, hard to overcome, guarded by Rāvaṇa.”
'23': >-
  Speaking thus, the mighty hero—the elder brother of Lakṣmaṇa—swiftly descended
  from the mountain-peak.
'24': >-
  Having descended from that mountain, that righteous-souled Rāghava beheld his
  own army—supremely hard for enemies to assail.
'25': >-
  Then, together with Sugrīva, having marshalled the great monkey-king’s host,
  time-knowing Rāghava, at the fitting time, urged (them) on toward battle.
'26': >-
  Then, at that time, the great-armed archer, encompassed by a vast force, set
  forth in front, facing Laṅkā, the city.
'27': >-
  Vibhīṣaṇa and Sugrīva, Hanūmān, Jāmbavān, Nala, the lord of bears, and
  likewise Nīla, and Lakṣmaṇa followed him then.
'28': >-
  Thereafter, the exceedingly great host of bears and monkeys, covering the wide
  earth, followed after Rāghava.
'29': >-
  The monkeys, resembling elephants and acting as mighty warders, seized
  hundreds of mountain-peaks and great trees grown tall.
'30': >-
  After a long time, those two brothers—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, crushers of
  foes—reached Laṅkā, the city of Rāvaṇa.
'31': >-
  (They beheld it) lovely, garlanded with banners, adorned with groves and
  gardens; having wondrous ramparts, most difficult to approach, with lofty
  walls and gateways.
'32': >-
  Urged by Rāma’s words, the forest-dwellers, as commanded, pressed close and
  encamped—(before) that city, hard to assail even for the gods.
'33': >-
  At Laṅkā’s northern gate—lofty like a mountain-peak—Rāma, with his younger
  brother, the bowman, kept watch and also blockaded it.
'34': >-
  Thus did Rāma, son of Daśaratha, take position before
  Laṅkā—Rāvaṇa-guarded—while the heroic Lakṣmaṇa attended upon him.
'35': >-
  Reaching the northern gate where Rāvaṇa held his station, none but Rāma was
  capable of guarding that gate.
'36': >-
  (Laṅkā was) terrible, occupied by Rāvaṇa, like the ocean by Varuṇa—protected
  all around by dreadful rākṣasas with weapons.
'37': >-
  Like Pātāla with dānavas—causing fear to the timid—many diverse arrays and
  dispositions of warriors had been set in place.
'38': >-
  He saw nets of weapons, and likewise coats of armour. But first, having
  reached the gate, Nīla, the commander of the monkey host, (stood there).
'39': >-
  That valiant one stood together with Mainda and Dvivida; and Angada, of very
  great strength, took charge of the southern gate.
'40': >-
  With Ṛṣabha, Gavākṣa, Gaja, and Gavaya, Hanūmān—the mighty monkey—guarded the
  western gate.
'41': >-
  Along with Pramāthin and Praghasa and other heroes assembled, Sugrīva himself
  stood firm in the central division.
'42': >-
  Together with all the foremost monkeys—like Garuḍa and the Wind in
  swiftness—there were famed troop-leaders among the monkeys: thirty-six crores
  (of companies).
'43': >-
  Where Sugrīva the monkey had encamped after pressing close, there—by the
  command of Rāma—Lakṣmaṇa, together with Vibhīṣaṇa, (made dispositions).
'44': >-
  At each and every gate he stationed crores upon crores of monkeys. And on the
  western side of Rāma (stood) Suṣeṇa together with Jāmbavān.
'45': >-
  Not far away, in the central division, he stood, followed by many forces.
  Those tiger-like monkeys, like fanged tigers, grasping trees and
  mountain-tops, stood joyfully ready for battle.
'46': >-
  All with twisted tails; all armed with fangs and claws; all with strange and
  variegated limbs; and all with fearsome faces.
'47': >-
  Some had the strength of ten elephants; some were tenfold greater; and some
  were equal in prowess to a thousand elephants.
'48': >-
  Some possessed strength in surging masses; some were a hundredfold greater;
  and others there, the monkey troop-leaders, had immeasurable might.
'49': >-
  Wondrous and strange was their gathering; there arose there the monkey armies
  like a swarm of locusts taking wing.
'50': >-
  The sky seemed filled, and the earth indeed seemed filled, by monkeys who had
  encamped around Laṅkā and by those leaping and flying about.
'51': >-
  Hundreds of thousands of hosts of bears and forest-dwellers came up to the
  gates of Laṅkā, others (approaching) all around to fight.
'52': >-
  That mountain (by Laṅkā) was covered on all sides by those monkeys; and a
  thousand tens of thousands (i.e., a vast multitude) surrounded that city.
'53': >-
  With mighty monkeys bearing trees in their hands, Laṅkā was encompassed on
  every side—hard to enter even for the wind.
'54': >-
  The rākṣasas fell into astonishment, suddenly pressed upon by monkeys
  resembling clouds, equal to Indra in prowess.
'55': >-
  A great roar arose there as the massed force surged forward, like the sound of
  waters when the ocean is broken open.
'56': >-
  By that mighty sound, all Laṅkā—with her walls and gateways, with her
  mountains, forests, and groves—shook and quivered.
'57': >-
  That army, protected by Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, and by Sugrīva, became even more
  invincible—even to all gods and asuras.
'58': >-
  Rāghava, having thus encamped his own army for the slaying of the rākṣasas,
  and having consulted with his counsellors, and having determined again and
  again,
'59': >-
  desiring continuity and proper sequence, knowing the true principles of
  ordered action, and—having obtained Vibhīṣaṇa’s consent—remembering the duties
  of kingship,
'60': >-
  summoned Angada, the son of Vāli, and spoke these words: “Go, gentle one, to
  Daśagrīva and speak to him my message, O monkey.”
'61': >-
  “Leaping over the city of Laṅkā, casting away fear, and free from distress—(go
  and speak to) him whose fortune is fallen, whose sovereignty is lost, who is
  about to die, whose mind is ruined.”
'62': >-
  “Of ṛṣis, of devas, of gandharvas and apsarases; of nāgas, and then of yakṣas;
  and of kings, O ranger of the night—”
'63': >-
  “—and whatever sin has been done through delusion by you, an arrogant rākṣasa:
  surely your pride, born of Brahmā’s boon, has now departed. Today has come
  upon you the hard-to-ward-off ripening of that sin.”
'64': >-
  “I, your wielder of punishment, tormented by the abduction of my wife, stand
  at Laṅkā’s gate bearing the rod of chastisement.”
'65': >-
  “O rākṣasa, standing firm in battle, you shall go to the station of the devas
  and great ṛṣis—and of all royal seers as well (i.e., you shall be slain and
  attain their realm).”
'66': >-
  “By what strength and by what magic, O vilest of rākṣasas, did you carry off
  Sītā after overstepping me? Show that now.”
'67': >-
  “I shall make this world free of rākṣasas with my keen arrows—unless you come
  seeking refuge, bringing the daughter of Janaka, Maithilī, (back with you).”
'68': >-
  “This righteous-souled Vibhīṣaṇa, foremost of rākṣasas, has come (to me). This
  illustrious one shall surely attain the sovereignty of Laṅkā, free of thorns
  (i.e., without enemies).”
'69': >-
  “For you, even for a moment, it is not possible to enjoy kingship through
  unrighteousness—supported by fools, sinful, and not knowing your own self.”
'70': >-
  “Fight, O rākṣasa, holding fast your courage, clinging to your heroism. When
  you are brought to rest in battle by my arrows, then you will become
  purified.”
'71': >-
  “Even if you enter the three worlds, becoming a bird, O night-ranger, once you
  come within the range of my sight you shall not go back alive.”
'72': >-
  “I speak to you words for your good: let the rites due after death be done
  (for you). Let Laṅkā be well-ordered; your life rests in my hands.”
'73': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma of unwearied deeds, that son of Tārā (Angada) entered
  the sky and departed—like embodied fire (leaping upward).
'74': >-
  In but a moment, the illustrious Angada flew past and beheld Rāvaṇa’s palace;
  he saw Rāvaṇa seated without agitation, together with his ministers.
'75': >-
  Then, falling down not far from him, the best of monkeys—Angada, wearing
  golden armlets—stood there, blazing like fire.
'76': >-
  Having announced himself in person, he caused (Rāvaṇa and) his ministers to
  hear that entire message of Rāma—excellent, neither deficient nor excessive
  (in any part).
'77': >-
  “I am the messenger of Rāma, lord of Kośala, of unwearied deeds. I am named
  Angada, the son of Vāli—if that has reached your ear.”
'78': >-
  “Rāghava Rāma, increaser of Kauśalyā’s joy, says to you: ‘Come forth and fight
  in return; become a man, not a barbarous wretch.’”
'79': >-
  “I shall slay you together with your ministers, your sons, your kinsmen, and
  your relatives. When you are slain, the three worlds shall be free from
  anxiety.”
'80': >-
  “Today I shall deliver (the worlds) from you—the enemy of devas, dānavas,
  yakṣas, gandharvas, serpents, and rākṣasas, and a thorn in the side of the
  ṛṣis.”
'81': >-
  “When you are slain, Vibhīṣaṇa’s sovereignty shall come to be—unless, having
  honoured Vaidehī, you bow down and give her back.”
'82': >-
  While the best of monkeys was speaking such harsh words, the lord of the
  hordes of night-rangers was overcome by intolerable wrath.
'83': >-
  Then, seized by anger, that evil-minded one ordered his ministers again and
  again: “Seize him!” and “Slay him!”
'84': >-
  Hearing Rāvaṇa’s command, four dreadful night-rangers then seized him, blazing
  in splendour like a flaming fire.
'85': >-
  But the son of Tārā, strong-souled, allowed himself to be seized, so that he
  might display his strength to that host of rākṣasas.
'86': >-
  Then Angada, taking those (rākṣasas) clinging to his two arms as though they
  were birds, sprang up to a palace resembling a mountain.
'87': >-
  By the force of his upward leap, those rākṣasas were flung off there; all of
  them fell upon the ground, before the very eyes of the lord of rākṣasas.
'88': >-
  Then, upon the palace-top, lofty like a mountain-peak, that valiant son of
  Vāli strode about before the lord of rākṣasas.
'89': >-
  And it cracked beneath his tread, before Daśagrīva’s eyes, like a peak of
  Himavat split asunder by a thunderbolt.
'90': >-
  Having broken the palace-top, and having made his own name renowned, and
  roaring with a very great cry, he leapt up into the sky.
'91': >-
  Afflicting all the rākṣasas and gladdening the monkeys, he came, amid the
  monkey hosts, to Rāma’s side.
'92': >-
  Rāvaṇa, however, grew exceedingly wrathful at the violation of his palace;
  and, seeing his own destruction, he became one whose very breath was a sigh.
'93': >-
  But Rāma, surrounded by many rejoicing monkeys roaring aloud, longing for the
  slaying of the foe, advanced toward battle alone.
'94': >-
  Suṣeṇa, the great hero, the monkey like a mountain-peak, surrounded there by
  many monkeys able to assume forms at will,
'95': >-
  restraining the gates by Sugrīva’s word, that invincible monkey moved about
  (guarding them) like the moon moving among the stars.
'96': >-
  Seeing the hundred akṣauhiṇīs of the forest-dwellers, encamped around Laṅkā
  and surging like the ocean,
'97': >-
  the rākṣasas fell into astonishment; others fell into fear; and others, in
  battle, through delight, attained delight alone (i.e., exulted).
'98': >-
  For the rākṣasas, dejected, saw the entire space between wall and moat
  pervaded by monkeys; they beheld the rampart made as it were ‘monkey-filled’,
  and crying “Alas! Alas!” the rākṣasas, seized by fear, raised a great lament.
'99': >-
  When that tumult, most dreadful, had arisen, the warriors of the rākṣasa king
  seized great weapons, and moved to and fro like the winds at the end of an age
  (yuga).
'100': >-
  Thus ends the Forty-first Canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “Angada’s Embassy (as messenger)”.
