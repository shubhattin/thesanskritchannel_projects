  Having spoken thus, Hanumān then addressed that most fortunate woman, the
  ascetic who followed the path of righteousness, she who was clad in
  bark-garments and black antelope-skin.
'2': >-
  “We have suddenly entered this cavern, covered over with darkness; and we are
  worn out by hunger and thirst, utterly exhausted and distressed on every side.
'3': >-
  “We entered a vast fissure in the earth, tormented by thirst; and here we
  behold various conditions of things—manifold marvels comparable to wonders
  beyond belief.
'4': >-
  “Seeing these, we have become deeply shaken, bewildered, our minds confounded,
  and our senses as though lost. Whose are these trees of gold, shining like the
  newly risen sun?
'5': >-
  “And these roots and fruits that are pure and fit for food; these aerial cars
  made of gold, and these dwellings fashioned of silver—whose are they?
'6': >-
  “These windows are of refined gold; they are covered with lattices of jewels;
  the trees are in blossom and laden with fruit—auspicious, fragrant, and of
  holy delight.
'7': >-
  “By whose splendour are these trees made of Jāmbūnada-gold? And how is it that
  golden lotuses have sprung up in this spotless water?
'8': >-
  “How is it that fish of gold are seen here together with tortoises? Is it by
  the power of your own might, or by whose ascetic energy is all this wrought?
'9': >-
  “Since none of us knows, you ought to tell us everything.” Thus addressed by
  Hanumān, that ascetic, steadfast in dharma, replied.
'10': >-
  She, devoted to the welfare of all beings, answered Hanumān: “O bull among
  monkeys, a mighty and radiant one named Maya, a master of illusion, (was
  concerned with this place).
'11': >-
  By his magic this entire golden forest was fashioned. In former times, among
  the foremost of the Dānava chiefs, there was one who was (as) Viśvakarmā
  himself.
'12': >-
  By him this divine golden, excellent mansion was constructed. And he,
  performing great austerities in a vast forest for thousands of years,
'13': >-
  obtained a boon from the Grandfather (Brahmā), and gained all the wealth of
  Uśanas (Śukra). Having thus brought everything into being, that powerful one
  then became lord of all desired things.
'14': >-
  For some time he dwelt happily in this great forest. But Indra, the slayer of
  Pūrandara, saw that chief of Dānavas attached to the apsaras Hemā,
'15': >-
  and, advancing, he seized his thunderbolt and slew him. And this excellent
  forest was given by Brahmā to Hemā.
'16': >-
  “Eternal is the enjoyment of pleasures here, and this house is made wholly of
  gold. I am Swayamprabhā, the daughter of Merusāvarṇi.
'17': >-
  “O foremost of monkeys, I guard this mansion for Hemā. My beloved friend Hemā
  is skilled in dance and song.
'18': >-
  “And by her I have received a boon; therefore I guard this great mansion. What
  is your purpose, and for whose sake have you come into these wild tracts?
'19': >-
  “And how was this inaccessible forest discovered by you? Having eaten these
  pure roots and fruits and having drunk water, you ought to tell me
  everything.”
'20': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-first canto, named “The Hospitality of Swayamprabhā,” in
  the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic.
