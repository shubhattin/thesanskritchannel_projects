'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-twenty-third sarga, called “Indra’s Bestowal of Boons.”
'1': >-
  When the son of Kakutstha (Rāma) had departed (from the gods after their
  purpose was fulfilled), Mahendra—Indra, the chastiser of Pāka—exceedingly
  delighted, spoke to Rāghava, who stood with joined palms.
'2': >-
  “Unfailing and most auspicious is thy sight, O Rāma, bull among men. We are
  filled with joy because of it. Therefore speak—what is desired in thy heart?”
'3': >-
  Thus addressed by great-souled Mahendra, serene and gracious, Rāghava—his mind
  wholly pleased and himself rejoicing—spoke these words.
'4': >-
  “If, O Lord of the gods, thou hast indeed conceived goodwill toward me, then I
  shall declare it. Make true my word, O best of speakers.”
'5': >-
  “For my sake, those valiant ones who have gone to the abode of Yama—let all
  those vānaras regain life and arise again.”
'6': >-
  “Those vānaras who, for my sake, have been separated from their sons and
  wives—O giver of honor—desiring them with joyful hearts, I wish to behold them
  all.”
'7': >-
  “Heroic and mighty, and counting not death, they strove their utmost and yet
  fell. Revive them, O Purandara.”
'8': >-
  “Those who, devoted to what is dear to me, regarded not death—by thy grace may
  they come together again. This boon I choose.”
'9': >-
  “Free from sickness, free from wounds, endowed with complete strength and
  manly vigor—I wish to see the monkeys and likewise the bears, O giver of
  honor.”
'10': >-
  “And let there be, even out of season, blossoms, roots, and fruits; and let
  the rivers there be clear and stainless—wherever the vānaras may dwell.”
'11': >-
  Having heard the words of that great-souled Rāghava, Mahendra replied with
  words filled with delight.
'12': >-
  “Great indeed is this boon, dear child—this which thou hast spoken, O best of
  the Raghus. Never before have I spoken thus twice; therefore this shall surely
  come to pass.”
'13': >-
  “Let all those arise again who were slain in battle by the rākṣasas—both the
  bears and the monkeys, even those whose tails were cut, whose faces were
  marred, and whose arms were severed.”
'14': >-
  “Free from sickness, free from wounds, endowed with full strength and prowess,
  the monkeys shall rise up—as though awakened after the ending of sleep.”
'15': >-
  “With friends and kinsmen and relatives, with their own people—all shall come
  together again, united in supreme joy.”
'16': >-
  “And out of season, trees variegated with flowers and laden with fruits shall
  appear, O mighty-armed one; and the rivers shall be filled with water.”
'17': >-
  “At first their bodies were wounded; now they became unwounded and sound.
  Thereupon all those best of vānaras rose up, as though they had merely slept.”
'18': >-
  All the vānaras became astonished, saying, “What is this?” And all the
  foremost of the gods, seeing the son of Kakutstha with his purpose fully
  accomplished, looked on.
'19': >-
  Then, exceedingly delighted, they praised Rāma together with Lakṣmaṇa, and
  said: “Go to Ayodhyā from here, O king, and dismiss the vānaras.”
'20': >-
  “Console Maithilī—faithful to thee, devoted, and illustrious. Behold thy
  brother Bharata, who practices vows, wasted with grief for thee.”
'21': >-
  “And see the great-souled Śatrughna, and all thy mothers, O subduer of foes.
  Have thyself consecrated (as king), and, having gone to the citizens, fill
  them with delight.”
'22': >-
  Having thus spoken, the thousand-eyed Indra, together with the gods, departed
  in joy with Rāma and the son of Sumitrā (Lakṣmaṇa) (duly honored), mounting
  aerial cars radiant as the sun.
'23': >-
  And Kakutstha, having paid reverence to all those foremost among the
  Thirty-three gods, then, together with his brother Lakṣmaṇa, gave the order
  for encampment (and rest).
'24': >-
  Thereafter that vast host—protected by Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—joyous in spirit and
  illustrious, shone on every side; blazing with splendor, it appeared as though
  it were the night made manifest by the cool-rayed moon.
'25': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa— the sacred epic composed by the
  Ṛṣis—within the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the one-hundred-and-twenty-third sarga, called
  “Indra’s Bestowal of Boons.”
