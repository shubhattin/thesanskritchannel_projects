  Now begins the sixty-seventh canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Slaying of Māndhātṛ.”
'1': >-
  Now, when the night had set in, Śatrughna questioned the brāhmaṇa Cyavana, the
  delight of the Bhṛgus, about the manner and measure of Lavaṇa’s strength.
'2': >-
  “And what is the power of that trident, O Brahman? And who in former times
  were destroyed—having come to single combat against him, with that trident as
  his chief weapon?”
'3': >-
  Hearing those words of great-souled Śatrughna, the mighty and radiant Cyavana
  replied to the delight of the Raghus.
'4': >-
  “Countless are the deeds associated with this matter, O Raghunandana; but
  listen from me to what took place in the lineage that sprang from Ikṣvāku.”
'5': >-
  “Formerly, in Ayodhyā, there was a powerful king, the son of Yuvanāśva,
  renowned by the name Māndhātṛ, a hero famed for his prowess in the three
  worlds.”
'6': >-
  “Having brought the entire earth under his rule and sovereignty, that lord of
  men then undertook an effort to conquer even the world of the gods.”
'7': >-
  “A keen fear arose in Indra and in the great-souled gods, when Māndhātṛ made
  preparations with the desire to win the heavenly world.”
'8': >-
  “Honoured by hosts of gods, the earthly king mounted (as it were) a pledge:
  with half the seat of Śakra and half the sovereignty, he would be content.”
'9': >-
  “Knowing the sinful intention within him, Pākaśāsana (Indra), using
  conciliation, spoke these words to Yuvanāśva’s son.”
'10': >-
  “You are a king in the world of men, O bull among men. Without first making
  the earth obedient, you desire here the sovereignty of the gods!”
'11': >-
  “If, O hero, the whole earth—this entire world—is completely under your
  control, then take up the kingdom of the gods as well, together with your
  attendants, forces, and conveyances.”
'12': >-
  Thus addressed by Indra, Māndhātṛ spoke in reply: “Where, O Śakra, is my
  command resisted upon the earth?”
'13': >-
  The thousand-eyed one answered him: “A rākṣasa named Lavaṇa, the son of Madhu,
  in the Madhu forest, does not obey your order, O sinless king.”
'14': >-
  Hearing that dreadful and unwelcome statement spoken by the thousand-eyed
  Indra, the king was ashamed; with face cast down, he was unable to utter a
  word.
'15': >-
  Then, having taken leave of the thousand-eyed one, and still somewhat downcast
  from shame, that illustrious lord of men returned again to this world.
'16': >-
  Nursing wrath within his heart, and accompanied by his attendants, army, and
  mounts, the foe-subduing king came forth to bring Madhu’s son under control.
'17': >-
  Desiring battle with Lavaṇa, that bull among men dispatched a messenger to
  Lavaṇa’s presence.
'18': >-
  Having gone, the messenger spoke many harsh and unwelcome words to Madhu’s
  son; and as he spoke thus, the rākṣasa devoured that envoy.
'19': >-
  When the messenger delayed long, the king, filled with wrath, assailed that
  rākṣasa on every side with a shower of arrows.
'20': >-
  Then, laughing aloud, that rākṣasa seized the trident in his hand, and for the
  destruction of the king together with his retinue, he hurled forth that
  supreme weapon.
'21': >-
  That blazing trident reduced to ashes the king along with his attendants,
  forces, and mounts, and then returned again into Lavaṇa’s hand.
'22': >-
  Thus that exceedingly great king was slain, together with his army and
  conveyances. Such, O gentle one, is the immeasurable and unsurpassed might of
  the trident.
'23': >-
  “At dawn tomorrow you will slay Lavaṇa—of this there is no doubt. Quickly,
  once you have taken up your weapons, victory will surely be yours.”
'24': >-
  “And the worlds shall have well-being when this deed is accomplished by you.
  Thus have I told you everything concerning that evil-souled Lavaṇa—”
'25': >-
  “—and also the dreadful, immeasurable power of the trident, O bull among men,
  and the destruction of King Māndhātṛ that came about through it, O sovereign.”
'26': >-
  “You, O great-souled one, will slay Lavaṇa at dawn tomorrow; of this I have no
  doubt at all. For, O king of men, if he goes forth without the trident in
  search of flesh, your victory will assuredly come to pass.”
'27': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-seventh canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Slaying of Māndhātṛ.”
