'0': Om. Salutations to the Supreme Self (Paramatman).
'1': Now begins the revered Bhagavad Gita.
'2': >-
  Now, the Fifteenth Chapter: The Yoga of the Supreme Person (Purushottama
  Yoga).
'3': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'4': >-
  They speak of the imperishable Ashvattha (the sacred fig-tree) with its root
  above and its branches below; its leaves are the Vedic hymns (the metres). He
  who knows that tree thus is the knower of the Vedas.
'5': >-
  Its branches extend both downward and upward, nourished and strengthened by
  the modes of Nature (gunas); their tender shoots are the objects of the
  senses. And its roots, stretching downward, spread forth in the world of men,
  binding one through action (karma) and its consequences.
'6': >-
  Its true form is not perceived here (in this world) as such—neither its end,
  nor its beginning, nor its firm foundation. Having cut down this deeply rooted
  Ashvattha with the strong axe of non-attachment,
'7': >-
  then that Supreme Abode is to be sought, having reached which one does not
  return again. To that primal Person indeed I take refuge, from whom this
  ancient stream of activity has flowed forth.
'8': >-
  Free from pride and delusion, having conquered the fault of attachment, ever
  steadfast in the Self (inward spirit), with desires turned away and brought to
  cessation, liberated from the pairs of opposites known as pleasure and
  pain—such undeluded ones go to that imperishable state.
'9': >-
  There the sun does not illumine, nor the moon, nor fire. Having gone there,
  they do not return. That is My supreme Abode.
'10': >-
  An eternal portion of Mine, having become the individual soul (jiva) in the
  world of living beings, draws to itself the senses—of which the mind is the
  sixth—abiding in Nature (prakriti), and struggles on.
'11': >-
  When the Lord (the embodied self) obtains a body, and when He departs from it,
  He takes these (the mind and senses) and goes, just as the wind carries
  fragrances from their seat (the flowers).
'12': >-
  Presiding over the ear and the eye, the sense of touch, and the tongue, and
  the nose—and also over the mind—this one experiences and enjoys the objects of
  the senses.
'13': >-
  The deluded do not perceive Him when He departs, or when He abides, or when He
  experiences, endowed with the modes of Nature; but those who possess the eye
  of knowledge behold Him.
'14': >-
  Striving yogins behold Him established within the Self; but those who strive
  without self-mastery, whose minds are not refined and who are lacking
  discernment, do not behold Him.
'15': >-
  That radiance which dwells in the sun and illumines the whole universe, and
  that which is in the moon and in fire—know that radiance to be Mine.
'16': >-
  Entering the earth, I sustain all beings by My power; and becoming the moon,
  of the nature of sap, I nourish all herbs and plants.
'17': >-
  Becoming the fire of digestion (Vaishvanara) and abiding in the bodies of
  living beings, united with the incoming and outgoing breaths (prana and
  apana), I digest the four kinds of food.
'18': >-
  And I am seated in the heart of all; from Me arise memory, knowledge, and also
  their removal (forgetfulness). By all the Vedas I alone am to be known; I am
  indeed the author of the Vedanta and the knower of the Vedas.
'19': >-
  Two kinds of beings (purushas) are spoken of in this world: the perishable and
  the imperishable. The perishable is all beings; the imperishable is called the
  immutable (the Kutastha).
'20': >-
  But distinct from these is the Supreme Person, proclaimed as the highest Self
  (Paramatman), who, entering the three worlds, sustains them—the imperishable
  Lord.
'21': >-
  Because I transcend the perishable, and am even higher than the imperishable,
  therefore in the world and in the Veda I am renowned as the Supreme Person
  (Purushottama).
'22': >-
  He who, undeluded, thus knows Me as the Supreme Person—he is the knower of
  all, and he worships Me with his whole being, O Bharata.
'23': >-
  Thus this most secret teaching has been spoken by Me, O sinless one.
  Understanding this, a man becomes wise, and all his duties are fulfilled, O
  Bharata.
'24': >-
  Om—That is the Real (Tat Sat). Thus, in the Upanishads of the Bhagavad Gita,
  in the science of Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue between
  Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the Fifteenth Chapter, entitled “The Yoga of the
  Supreme Person (Purushottama Yoga).”
