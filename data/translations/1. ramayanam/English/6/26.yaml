  Now begins the twenty-sixth chapter in Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Surveying of the Monkey-Host.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words—truthful and unmanly in no way—spoken by Sāraṇa, King
  Rāvaṇa replied to Sāraṇa.
'2': >-
  Even if the devas, gandharvas, and dānavas were to assail me, I would not give
  up Sītā—not even out of fear of all the worlds.
'3': >-
  But you, gentle one, greatly terrified and sorely oppressed by the monkeys,
  deem it right this very day to hand Sītā back!
'4': >-
  “Who indeed is there as an adversary that is fit to conquer me in
  battle?”—having thus spoken harsh words, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas,
'5': >-
  then mounted a splendid palace, white as snow, towering to the height of many
  tālas, being eager to behold (the enemy host).
'6': >-
  Accompanied by those two spies, Rāvaṇa—his mind possessed by wrath—looked upon
  that ocean, the mountains, and the forests.
'7': >-
  He beheld a region of the earth completely filled with plavaṅgamas, and that
  boundless, unbearable might of the great-powerful vānaras.
'8': >-
  Having gazed upon them, King Rāvaṇa questioned Sāraṇa again and again: “Which
  among these are the foremost monkeys? Which are the valiant? Which are of
  great strength?”
'9': >-
  “Which very mighty ones advance in the forefront on every side? To whose
  counsel does Sugrīva listen? And who are the troop-leaders and leaders of
  troop-leaders?”
'10': >-
  “Sāraṇa, tell me everything—what is the prowess of these plavaṅgamas?” Thus
  questioned by the lord of the rākṣasas, Sāraṇa,
'11': >-
  who knew the chiefs, then began to speak of the foremost forest-dwellers
  there: “This monkey who stands facing Laṅkā, roaring,”
'12': >-
  “is surrounded by a hundred thousands of troop-leaders; by his mighty roar,
  with its walls and its gateways,”
'13': >-
  “all Laṅkā, along with her mountains, forests, and groves, is shaken—this lord
  of all monkeys is the great-souled Sugrīva.”
'14': >-
  “At the head of the forces stands a hero, a troop-leader named Nīla, mighty;
  raising up his arms, he goes stamping the earth with his feet.”
'15': >-
  “Facing Laṅkā, again and again he stretches himself in wrath; he is like a
  mountain-peak in form, and resembles the pollen of a lotus in hue.”
'16': >-
  “In exceeding fury he snaps his tail again and again; by the sound of his tail
  the ten quarters resound.”
'17': >-
  “This is Aṅgada, installed by King Sugrīva as crown-prince; he challenges you
  to battle.”
'18': >-
  “The son resembling Vālin, ever dear to Sugrīva—he exerts his might for
  Rāghava’s sake, as Varuṇa does for Indra’s.”
'19': >-
  “All this resolve of his arose once Janaka’s daughter was seen by swift
  Hanūmān, the well-wisher of Rāghava.”
'20': >-
  “This mighty one, taking with him many troops of monkey-lords, advances
  against you with his own division, to crush you.”
'21': >-
  “And, encompassed by the great strength of Anuvāli’s son also, a hero stands
  firm in battle—this is Nala, the cause of the bridge (builder of the
  causeway).”
'22': >-
  “Those who brace their limbs, bellow and roar, and who rise up and yawn again
  and again in wrath—those foremost of monkeys—”
'23': >-
  “they are dreadful, hard to withstand, fierce, and of fierce valor. Eight
  hundred thousand and also a hundred million—these heroes, dwellers in Candana
  (the Candana region), follow him.”
'24': >-
  “He too hopes to crush Laṅkā with his own division—Śveta, white like silver,
  swift, and of terrible prowess.”
'25': >-
  “A wise monkey, a hero renowned in the three worlds—he quickly goes to Sugrīva
  and then returns again.”
'26': >-
  “Apportioning the monkey army, gladdening the divisions, he who formerly
  ranged about a lovely mountain on the bank of the river Gomati—”
'27': >-
  “that mountain, endowed with many peaks, is called by name Saṃrocana; there
  rules a troop-leader named Kumuda.”
'28': >-
  “He drags along, with delight, hundreds of thousands; his hosts have tails of
  many spans and are furnished with long tails.”
'29': >-
  “Coppery, yellow, pale, and white—scattered about, terrible to
  behold—undaunted and fierce, that monkey longs for battle; he also hopes to
  crush Laṅkā with his own division.”
'30': >-
  “And this one, lion-like, tawny, with long mane—silent, he gazes upon Laṅkā as
  though he would burn it with his eyes—”
'31': >-
  “the Vindhya, the Kṛṣṇa mountain, the Sahya, and the fair-looking Sudarśana
  mountain he continually inhabits, O king—he is the troop-leader named Rambha;
  and his foremost monkeys are a hundred hundred-thousands and thirty (i.e., ten
  million and thirty hundred-thousands).”
'32': >-
  “Him, as he goes, dreadful monkeys—fierce and of fierce valor—surround and
  follow, to crush Laṅkā by their might.”
'33': >-
  “But he who spreads his ears, and yawns again and again—yet does not tremble
  at death, nor does he rush about among the army—”
'34': >-
  “he quivers with anger and again casts sidelong glances. Behold the flinging
  of his tail—this great-powerful one is bellowing.”
'35': >-
  “Swift as the wind, fearless, he continually inhabits the lovely Sālvēya
  mountain, O king—he is the troop-leader named Śarabha.”
'36': >-
  “All the troop-leaders named Vihāra belong to this strong one; O king, they
  are forty and a hundred thousand.”
'37': >-
  “And he who, like a cloud, stands covering the sky, great among the
  monkey-heroes—like Vāsava among the gods—”
'38': >-
  “whose mighty sound is heard like the blare of kettledrums—the roar of the
  lords of monkeys who yearn for battle—”
'39': >-
  “he inhabits the excellent Pariyātra mountain; ever hard to withstand in war,
  he is the troop-leader named Panasa.”
'40': >-
  “A half of a hundred thousand troop-leaders attend upon him; he is best of
  troop-leaders, and their troops are arranged in divisions.”
'41': >-
  “And he who stands adorning a fearsome, leaping host, stationed on the shore
  of the ocean—like a second sea—”
'42': >-
  “this troop-leader is named Vinata, resembling a frog; he roams about drinking
  of the Veṇā, the best of rivers.”
'43': >-
  “Sixty hundred-thousands of plavaṅgamas are his force; a monkey named Krodhana
  challenges you to battle.”
'44': >-
  “Valiant and strong—such are the troops, in divisions; and the monkey who
  possesses a body of reddish-ochre hue—”
'45': >-
  “ever despising all monkeys, intoxicated with the pride of strength, the
  radiant one named Gavaya advances upon you in wrath.”
'46': >-
  “Seventy hundred-thousands attend upon him; he too hopes to crush Laṅkā with
  his own division.”
'47': >-
  “These are heroes hard to withstand, whose number cannot be
  determined—troop-leaders, best of troop-leaders; and their troops are arranged
  in divisions.”
'48': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-sixth chapter of Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the sacred, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first poet, called “The Surveying of the
  Monkey-Host.”
