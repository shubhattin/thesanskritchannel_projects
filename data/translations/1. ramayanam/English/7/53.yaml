  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, begins the fifty-third
  canto, named “The Account of King Nṛga’s Curse.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those exceedingly wondrous words of Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma became greatly
  delighted, and he spoke these words.
'2': >-
  In this age, especially, such a kinsman is hard to find—one like you, O gentle
  one, of great understanding, who follows the desire of my heart.
'3': >-
  And whatever intent abides in my heart, O you of auspicious marks—listen to
  it; having heard it, carry out my command.
'4': >-
  For four days, O gentle one, the work of the townsmen has indeed not been
  attended to; and that, O Saumitre, cuts into my very vitals.
'5': >-
  Let the citizens and the people of the realm be summoned, and also the family
  priest and the ministers; and let men and women who seek redress of their
  affairs come forth, O bull among men.
'6': >-
  That king who does not, day by day, attend to the business of the
  townspeople—having fallen into a dreadful, enclosed hell, he remains there; of
  this there is no doubt.
'7': >-
  For it is heard that formerly there was a king named Nṛga, of great renown—a
  protector of the earth, devoted to the brāhmaṇas, truthful in speech, and
  pure.
'8': >-
  Once, that lord among men—at Puṣkara—gave to the brāhmaṇas herds numbering a
  crore of cows, each with her calf and adorned with ornaments of gold.
'9': >-
  Then, O sinless one, a cow with her calf—being jostled in the crowd—strayed
  away and came into the keeping of a brāhmaṇa who maintained the sacred fires,
  who was poor, and who lived by gleaning.
'10': >-
  Tormented by hunger, that brāhmaṇa searched here and there for his lost cow,
  but for many years and throughout all the kingdoms he did not find her.
'11': >-
  Thereafter, going to Kanakhala, he saw his own cow—her calf now grown old yet
  herself healthy—in the dwelling of another brāhmaṇa.
'12': >-
  Then that twice-born man called her by her own familiar name, saying, “Come,
  Śabala!”—and the cow heard the voice.
'13': >-
  Recognizing that voice of the hungry brāhmaṇa, the cow followed behind him as
  he went—he who was like fire in splendour.
'14': >-
  And the brāhmaṇa who was maintaining her also quickly followed the cow, and
  going to that sage, he hastily declared, “This cow is mine.”
'15': >-
  “She was touched by the lion among kings, and given to me by Nṛga!”—thus
  between those two brāhmaṇas, both learned, there arose a great dispute.
'16': >-
  Then, disputing with one another, they approached the giver. And they reached
  the gate of the royal palace under Nṛga’s rule, seeking him.
'17': >-
  Dwelling there for many days and nights, they came to anger. And those two
  great-souled best of brāhmaṇas, wrathful and fully provoked, spoke words
  fraught with dreadful intent:
'18': >-
  “Since, for the accomplishment of the aims of petitioners, you do not grant
  them audience, you shall become unseen by all beings—a lizard.”
'19': >-
  “For many thousands of years, and for many hundreds of years besides, in this
  pit you shall dwell for a long time as a lizard.”
'20': >-
  “In this world, there shall arise one who increases the fame of the Yadus,
  renowned as Vāsudeva—Viṣṇu, having assumed a human form.”
'21': >-
  “He shall deliver you, O king, from that curse; and in due time, through him,
  your expiation and release shall come to pass.”
'22': >-
  “For the purpose of lightening the burden of the earth, the two—Nara and
  Nārāyaṇa—mighty in valour, shall be born when the Kali age has come.”
'23': >-
  Thus, having pronounced the curse, the two brāhmaṇas—freed from agitation—gave
  that cow, weak and aged, to the brāhmaṇa indeed.
'24': In this manner that king undergoes that most dreadful curse.
'25': >-
  For indeed, the thwarting of those who seek redress becomes a fault in kings.
  Therefore, let those who have business with me quickly be admitted to my
  presence.
'26': >-
  For the fruit of a righteous act does not depart from a ruler. Therefore go, O
  Saumitre; wait there, desiring the accomplishment of what is to be done.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-third canto, named “The Account of King Nṛga’s Curse,” in
  the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
