  Now begins the forty-eighth sarga of the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Abandonment of Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Hearing Lakṣmaṇa’s cruel words, the daughter of Janaka—Vaidehī—was plunged
  into the deepest grief and fell down.
'2': >-
  For a moment she lay as though unconscious, her eyes troubled and clouded with
  tears; then Janaka’s daughter spoke to Lakṣmaṇa in a piteous voice.
'3': >-
  “This body of mine, Lakṣmaṇa, has surely been fashioned for sorrow
  alone—created by the Disposer in such a way that today my very form appears as
  a personification of grief.
'4': >-
  “What sin did I commit in a former time, or who has ever been parted from his
  beloved as I have been—though I am of pure conduct and, being faithful, have
  been abandoned by the king?
'5': >-
  “Formerly I dwelt in the hermitage, ever following the feet of Rāma; and
  though I entreated you, Saumitrī, I still shared in his hardships and
  underwent affliction with him.
'6': >-
  “How indeed, gentle Saumya, shall I now live in the hermitage, made solitary
  and left alone? And to whom shall I tell my sorrow— I, whose whole being is
  devoted to sorrow?
'7': >-
  “What shall I say among the sages? What act of mine shall be spoken of as
  worthy? For on what account have I been cast off by the great-souled Rāghava?
'8': >-
  “Indeed, Saumitrī, I would not give up my life today in the waters of the
  Jāhnavī; yet the royal line of my husband would be mocked because of me.
'9': >-
  “Therefore do as you have been commanded, Saumitrī—abandon me, a sharer in
  misery; stand firm in the king’s आदेश, and listen also to these words of mine.
'10': >-
  “To my mothers-in-law, without distinction, with joined palms and with
  respectful restraint, bow your head and salute their feet, and speak to the
  lord of the earth of my welfare.
'11': >-
  “With your head bowed, Lakṣmaṇa, speak to all of them; and the king too should
  be addressed as one well-composed and firmly established in dharma.
'12': >-
  “You know, Rāghava, that Sītā is pure in very truth, endowed with supreme
  devotion, and ever intent upon your welfare.
'13': >-
  “I have been abandoned by you, O hero, because you fear disgrace among the
  people; and whatever you may have to say arising from calumny, that must be
  endured by me—for you are my highest refuge.
'14': >-
  “And the king must indeed be spoken to, being well-settled in dharma: ‘As you
  behave towards your brothers, so should you ever behave towards the
  citizens.’”
'15': “For that is your highest dharma; therefore your fame is unsurpassed.”
'16': >-
  “But whatever the townspeople may, O king, obtain in accordance with dharma—of
  that I do not grieve; I do not lament for my own body, O best of men.
'17': >-
  “In accordance with the citizens’ accusations, O delight of the Raghu line, so
  be it; for to a woman the husband is her deity, the husband is her kinsman,
  the husband is her guru.
'18': >-
  “Therefore, what is dear to one’s husband must be done—especially even at the
  cost of one’s very life. Thus, from my words, Rāma should be told this sum of
  my intent: ‘Do not look upon me today; go— I have passed beyond the season
  (and am not in ṛtu).’”
'19': >-
  As Sītā spoke thus, Lakṣmaṇa, wretched at heart, bowed his head to the earth,
  but was unable to utter a reply.
'20': >-
  Having circumambulated her, weeping with a great cry, he reflected for a
  moment and then said to her: “O fair one, what shall I say to you?
'21': >-
  “Never before have I seen you in such a plight, O blameless one; I have seen
  your feet. How indeed can I behold you here in the forest, separated from
  Rāma?
'22': >-
  So saying, having saluted her, he again embarked upon the boat; and having
  mounted it, he urged the boatman onward.
'23': >-
  Reaching the northern bank, burdened with the weight of sorrow and as though
  bewildered by grief, he quickly mounted the chariot.
'24': >-
  Again and again turning back and looking at Sītā as if she were without a
  protector, as she stood on the farther bank and moved about, Lakṣmaṇa then
  departed.
'25': >-
  Seeing from afar the chariot, and Lakṣmaṇa again and again, as she anxiously
  kept looking, Sītā was overcome by grief.
'26': >-
  That illustrious lady, bowed down beneath the burden of sorrow, rich in honor
  yet not seeing her lord though she was faithful, wept; wholly given to grief,
  she cried aloud with a mighty wail in the forest resounding with the cries of
  peacocks.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the forty-eighth sarga of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the sacred, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādikāvya, called “The Abandonment of Sītā.”
