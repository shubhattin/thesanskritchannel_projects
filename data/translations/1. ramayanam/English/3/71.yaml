  Now begins the seventy-first canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Account of Kabandha’s Curse.”
'1': >-
  “Formerly, O Rāma of mighty arms, possessed of great strength and prowess, my
  form was inconceivably splendid, and renowned throughout the three worlds.
'2': >-
  Even as is the radiance and beauty of Sūrya, of Soma, and of Śakra, so was my
  person; but assuming this form, I became a great terror, causing fear in the
  worlds.
'3': >-
  O Rāma, I used to frighten the sages who dwelt in the forest, now here, now
  there; then a great seer named Sthūlaśirā became angered by me.
'4': >-
  While gathering various forest produce, he was outraged and violated by me in
  this very form; seeing me thus, that terrible ascetic, who uttered dread
  curses, spoke to me.
'5': >-
  ‘Let this cruel form of yours become loathsome and despised!’—so he declared;
  and I, in my distress, entreated that enraged sage, asking, ‘When will the
  curse come to an end?’
'6': >-
  To me—thus afflicted by the curse—he spoke these words: ‘When Rāma, having cut
  off your arms, shall burn you in a lonely forest,’
'7': >-
  ‘then you will regain your own vast and auspicious form, resplendent with
  prosperity. Know, O Lakṣmaṇa, that you are the son of Danu.’
'8': >-
  “Through Indra’s wrath this form came upon me in that manner on the
  battlefield; for indeed, by the power of my austerities I had propitiated the
  Grandsire, Brahmā.
'9': >-
  He granted me long life; then delusion seized me, and I thought, ‘Having
  obtained longevity, what can Śakra do to me?’
'10': >-
  Thus, taking refuge in that misguided notion, I assaulted Śakra in battle.
  Then, with his thunderbolt—hundred-jointed—hurled from his arm,
'11': >-
  my thighs and my head were driven into my body. And though I besought him, he
  did not send me to the abode of Yama.
'12': >-
  He said to me, ‘Let the word of the Grandsire prove true.’ Then he added: ‘How
  can one whose thighs are broken, whose head and mouth are crushed, live long
  without food,
'13': >-
  though struck by the thunderbolt and fated to live for a very long time?’ Thus
  addressed, Śakra made for me arms extending a full yojana in length.
'14': >-
  Then he fashioned for me a mouth in my belly, set with sharp fangs. And so,
  with these long arms, I seize the creatures that roam this forest,
'15': >-
  and devour on every side lions, leopards, deer, and tigers. Then Indra spoke
  to me: ‘When Rāma, together with Lakṣmaṇa,
'16': >-
  shall cut off your arms in battle, then you will go to heaven. With this body,
  O dear one, you are to remain in this forest, O best of kings.
'17': >-
  Whatever I behold, of all beings, I take hold of—I delight in seizing. Surely,
  I think, Rāma will inevitably come within my grasp.’
'18': >-
  “Holding to that thought and worn out by the hardship of laying aside the
  body, you indeed are that Rāma—blessing be upon you. I do not seek anyone
  else, O Rāghava,
'19': >-
  for as the great sage declared, you alone can slay me in truth. I shall, O
  bull among men, serve you with counsel and guidance,
'20': >-
  and I shall instruct you in friendship—once I have been purified by fire.”
  Thus addressed by that Danu-born being, the righteous-souled Rāghava,
'21': >-
  with Lakṣmaṇa looking on, spoke these words: “My illustrious consort Sītā has
  been carried off by Rāvaṇa.
'22': >-
  After I had departed from Jana-sthāna together with my brother, as we moved at
  our ease, I know only his name and not the form of that rākṣasa.
'23': >-
  Nor do we know his dwelling-place or his might. We are afflicted with grief
  and without refuge, wandering about in confusion.
'24': >-
  Have compassion befitting your nature, and act to help us: bringing pieces of
  wood—broken, and dried with time, shattered by elephants—
'25': >-
  we shall burn you, O hero, in a great pit prepared for the purpose. You, then,
  must tell us of Sītā—by whom she was taken, and where, and by what means.
'26': >-
  Do what is supremely beneficial, if you know the truth.” Thus spoken to by
  Rāma, Danu’s peerless son,
'27': >-
  skilled in speech, replied to the speaker himself, Rāghava: “I do not possess
  divine knowledge; I do not recognize Maithilī.
'28': >-
  When I have spoken with one who will tell of her, then I shall tell you—after
  being burned and restored to my own proper form. Whoever knows that
  rākṣasa—him I shall name, O Rāma, with full resolve.
'29': >-
  For, O lord, while I remain unburned, I have no power to know that mighty and
  valiant rākṣasa by whom your Sītā was carried away.
'30': >-
  Indeed, great discernment has been lost through the fault of the curse, O
  Rāghava; because of my own deeds I obtained this form, condemned by the world.
'31': >-
  But before the Sun sets—while your beasts of burden are not yet wearied—cast
  me into a pit and burn me, O Rāma, according to the proper rite.
'32': >-
  When I have been rightly burned by you in the pit, O delight of the Raghu
  line, I shall tell you, O mighty hero, of him who will know that rākṣasa.
'33': >-
  With that one, O Rāghava, you must form friendship—he is righteous in conduct.
  He will arrange for you, O hero of swift valor, effective assistance.
'34': >-
  For to him nothing is unknown in the three worlds, O Rāghava; formerly, for a
  certain reason, he ranged about, surveying all the worlds in their entirety.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-first canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Account of Kabandha’s
  Curse.”
