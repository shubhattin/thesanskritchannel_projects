'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, is the
  one-hundred-and-tenth canto, entitled “The Ascent of Śrī Rāma to Heaven,
  together with His Younger Brothers.”
'1': >-
  Having gone a measure of one and a half yojanas, Raghunandana beheld the river
  Sarayū, whose sacred waters flowed with merit, lying with her course turned
  westward.
'2': >-
  Following that river, with its whirlpools in tumult, the king—Rāma, together
  with his people—arrived at that region, O delight of the Raghu race.
'3': >-
  Then, at that very moment, Brahmā, the grandsire, the father of the worlds,
  came, surrounded on every side by all the gods and by great-souled seers.
'4': >-
  He arrived at the place where the son of Kakutstha stood, prepared to go to
  heaven—Brahmā being encompassed by tens of crores of divine aerial cars.
'5': >-
  The firmament became covered with divine splendor—unsurpassed, turned into
  very radiance—by the heavenly beings, doers of righteous deeds, shining of
  themselves with their own innate lustre.
'6': >-
  Pure breezes blew, fragrant and bestowing delight; and a rain of flowers fell,
  released by the gods, like a vast and mighty downpour.
'7': >-
  There, with hundreds of musical instruments resounding, and thronged with
  Gandharvas and Apsarases, Rāma began to enter the waters of Sarayū with his
  feet.
'8': >-
  Then the Grandsire spoke from the sky: “Come, O Viṣṇu; blessings be upon you.
  By good fortune you have arrived, O Rāghava!”
'9': >-
  “Together with your brothers, who are like gods, enter your own proper form.
  Whatever form you desire, O mighty-armed one—enter that form which is truly
  yours: that Vaiṣṇava, exceedingly radiant, eternal form, belonging to the
  undying ether.”
'10': >-
  “For you, O Lord, are the course and final refuge of the worlds; none truly
  know you—apart from your wide-eyed Māyā, your former and primordial consort.
  You are the unthinkable, the Great Being, imperishable, the comprehender and
  support of all.”
'11': “Whatever form you wish, O great in splendor—enter that form yourself.”
'12': >-
  Hearing the words of the Grandsire and having firmly resolved, the high-minded
  Rāma entered the Vaiṣṇava radiance—bodily, together with his younger
  brothers—along with that wide-eyed Māyā, his former and primordial consort.
'13': >-
  Then the deities worshipped that God who was made manifest as Viṣṇu—along with
  the Sādhyas, the hosts of the Maruts, and Indra with Agni at their head.
'14': >-
  And the divine companies of seers; and the Gandharvas and Apsarases; and the
  Suparṇas, Nāgas, and Yakṣas; and the Daityas, Dānavas, and Rākṣasas—
'15': >-
  All were well-nourished and rejoicing, their desires completely fulfilled.
  Those gods, their sins gone as they moved in the threefold heaven, cried out,
  “Well done! Well done!”
'16': >-
  Then mighty and radiant Viṣṇu spoke to the Grandsire: “O you of excellent
  vows, you ought to grant these multitudes of people a world (a heavenly
  abode).”
'17': >-
  “For all these illustrious ones have followed after me out of affection; they
  are devoted—devotees who should indeed be cherished—and they have renounced
  themselves for my sake.”
'18': >-
  Hearing Viṣṇu’s words, Brahmā—the lord, the preceptor of the
  worlds—(ordained): “Let these who have assembled go to the worlds called
  Sāntānika.”
'19': >-
  “And whatever being has gone into an animal birth, if it likewise meditates
  upon you in this manner, it will indeed give up its life out of devotion and
  will dwell in that same lineage (of that heavenly state).”
'20': >-
  (Those worlds are) endowed with all the qualities of Brahmā, and are next
  after the Brahmaloka.
'21': >-
  The monkeys and the bears too entered their own proper wombs (origins), for
  all of them had issued forth from the gods—born of the Suras.
'22': >-
  Among them, Sugrīva entered the solar orb, before the eyes of all the gods,
  attaining his own father.
'23': >-
  When the Lord of the gods had thus spoken, all those who had come—like cows at
  a ford—entered the Sarayū, their hearts full of joy, their eyes troubled with
  tears.
'24': >-
  Whichever living being plunged into the water, becoming delighted, cast off
  the human body and mounted an aerial car.
'25': >-
  And hundreds of those gone to animal wombs, reaching the waters of Sarayū,
  went to the threefold heaven, their forms shining like light; and, with divine
  bodies, they became as though gods, blazing with radiance.
'26': >-
  Having reached the waters of Sarayū, the immovable and the movable beings
  alike—having obtained that moisture born of those waters—went up to the world
  of the gods.
'27': >-
  There too arrived the bears, monkeys, and rākṣasas; they also entered heaven,
  having laid aside their bodies in the waters.
'28': >-
  Then the preceptor of the worlds, having established all those who had
  assembled in heaven, departed to the vast celestial realm together with the
  thrice-ten gods, ever rejoicing.
'29': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa— the sacred work of the seers, the
  illustrious epic— in the Uttarakāṇḍa, the one-hundred-and-tenth canto,
  entitled “The Ascent of Śrī Rāma to Heaven, together with His Younger
  Brothers.”
