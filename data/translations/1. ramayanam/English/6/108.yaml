  Now, in the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, is the
  one-hundred-and-eighth sarga, named “The Beholding of Auspicious and
  Inauspicious Omens.”
'1': >-
  That charioteer, delighted at heart, urged on the chariot—one that crushed the
  hostile host—resembling a city of the Gandharvas, and lofty with its banners
  raised aloft.
'2': >-
  It was yoked with excellent, richly endowed horses adorned with golden
  garlands; furnished full with implements of war; and decked with flags and
  ensigns in abundance.
'3': >-
  It seemed as though it were devouring the sky and making the very earth
  resound—portending destruction to the enemy’s forces and gladdening one’s own
  host.
'4': >-
  Then the charioteer swiftly drove forth Rāvaṇa’s chariot—its great standard
  sounding as it rushed headlong, suddenly charging on.
'5': >-
  The king among men (Rāma) beheld the chariot of the lord of Rākṣasas, yoked
  with black horses and endowed with a dreadful splendor.
'6': >-
  It shone in the sky like a celestial car, radiant as the sun; dense with
  banners like flashes of lightning, and displaying the lustre of Indra’s
  rainbow.
'7': >-
  It discharged torrents of arrows, like a rain-bearing cloud pouring down
  showers. Seeing that enemy’s chariot, cloud-like, rushing on,
'8': >-
  and hearing a sound like that of a mountain being split asunder after being
  struck by a thunderbolt, he swiftly stretched his bow, bent like the young
  crescent-moon.
'9': >-
  Rāma spoke to Mātali, the charioteer of the Thousand-eyed (Indra): “Mātali,
  behold—the enemy’s chariot comes on, fiercely driven, towards us!
'10': >-
  Rushing in a great and violent speed, swerving to the left, he has surely
  resolved in battle to strike down even me in this manner.
'11': >-
  Therefore, keep yourself free from heedlessness; go forth to meet the foe’s
  chariot. I desire to shatter it, like the wind rising up to scatter a cloud.”
'12': >-
  Steady and unconfounded, with a mind and gaze untroubled and unimpeded—guide
  the chariot swiftly, keeping the reins in proper control.
'13': >-
  Truly you need not be instructed—fit indeed for Purandara’s chariot (Indra’s).
  I, intent on battle, only remind you; I do not presume to teach you.”
'14': >-
  Pleased with Rāma’s words, Mātali—the excellent charioteer of the gods—drove
  the chariot onward.
'15': >-
  Then, moving to the left and circling against Rāvaṇa’s great car, he shook
  Rāvaṇa with the dust raised by the wheels.
'16': >-
  Thereupon Daśagrīva, enraged, his coppery eyes wide with fury, assailed Rāma
  front to front with flights of arrows.
'17': >-
  Rāma, provoked by that assault and enduring it, gathered steadfastness through
  wrath, and in battle seized the mighty, swift bow of Indra.
'18': >-
  And he took up arrows of exceedingly great speed, radiant like the sun’s rays.
  Thus that great battle drew near—each desiring the other’s death—like two
  proud lions facing one another.
'19': >-
  Then the gods, together with Gandharvas, Siddhas, and supreme Ṛṣis, assembled
  to behold that duel of chariots, longing for Rāvaṇa’s destruction.
'20': >-
  There arose portents from the chariots—terrible and hair-raising—foretelling
  Rāvaṇa’s ruin and Rāghava’s rise to victory.
'21': >-
  The deity poured down blood upon Rāvaṇa’s chariot; and fierce, whirling winds
  began to blow, driving all awry and to the left.
'22': >-
  A great multitude of vultures wheeled in the sky about him; whichever way his
  chariot went, that way they ran and followed.
'23': >-
  Laṅkā was covered over with a twilight hue like hibiscus blossoms; and even by
  day the earth appeared as though it were ablaze.
'24': >-
  With thunderous crashes, great meteors fell with a mighty noise—casting the
  rākṣasas into dejection; these had arisen for Rāvaṇa’s harm.
'25': >-
  And wherever Rāvaṇa moved, there the earth shook; and as the rākṣasas struck,
  their arms felt as though they were seized and held fast.
'26': >-
  Reddish, yellow, pale, and white sunbeams appeared fallen before Rāvaṇa—like
  mineral ores upon a mountain.
'27': >-
  Followed by vultures, and spewing fire from their mouths, the jackals (śivāḥ)
  cried out, fixing their gaze upon his face—fierce and inauspicious.
'28': >-
  A contrary wind blew on the battlefield, raising up dust and causing the
  rākṣasa-king’s sight to be obscured.
'29': >-
  Indra’s thunderbolts fell all around upon his army—terrible, with unbearable
  sound—even though no rain-clouds had formed.
'30': >-
  All the quarters and intermediate directions were covered with darkness; with
  a great rain of dust, the sky too became hard to see.
'31': >-
  Raising a dreadful clamor against that chariot, mynas (sārikāḥ), harsh-voiced
  and terrible, fell there by the hundreds.
'32': >-
  From the hindquarters of his horses sparks flew; from their eyes tears flowed
  continuously; and they let forth alike fire and water.
'33': >-
  In this manner many fearsome portents arose—dreadful indeed—bringing about
  Rāvaṇa’s destruction.
'34': >-
  For Rāma also, auspicious and благоприятные (śivāni) signs appeared
  everywhere—gentle in nature and proclaiming victory.
'35': >-
  Beholding these favorable omens here for his own triumph, Rāghava became
  exceedingly delighted and deemed Rāvaṇa already slain.
'36': >-
  Then Rāghava, skilled in discerning omens, having observed in battle the signs
  that had arisen for himself, attained great joy and supreme contentment—and in
  the combat he performed yet greater deeds of valor.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-eighth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the
  venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Beholding of
  Auspicious and Inauspicious Omens.”
