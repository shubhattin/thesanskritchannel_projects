  Now begins the sixty-eighth chapter in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Dispute between Lavaṇa and Śatrughna.”
'1': >-
  While they were thus conversing and desiring an auspicious victory, the night
  swiftly passed for the great-souled Śatrughna.
'2': >-
  Then, when the spotless morning had come at that time, that rākṣasa—steadfast
  and resolute—went out from the city, urged on by his craving for prey and
  food.
'3': >-
  In the meanwhile, the hero Śatrughna, having crossed the river Yamunā, stood
  at the gate of Madhupura with his bow in hand.
'4': >-
  Then, when half the day had passed, that rākṣasa of cruel deeds came forth,
  bearing a burden consisting of many thousands of living beings.
'5': >-
  Then he saw Śatrughna standing at the gate with his weapon ready; and that
  demon addressed him, saying, “What will you do with this?”
'6': >-
  “Thousands like you—armed—O vilest of men, have been devoured by me in wrath.
  Do you, then, long for your appointed time of death?”
'7': >-
  “And my meal is complete—this wretch of a man! How, O evil-minded one, have
  you today come of your own accord into my very mouth?”
'8': >-
  As he spoke thus and laughed again and again, Śatrughna—endowed with mighty
  prowess—shed tears out of wrath.
'9': >-
  Overpowered by anger, that great-souled Śatrughna emitted, from all his limbs,
  rays of fiery radiance.
'10': >-
  And Śatrughna, exceedingly enraged, said to that night-roaming rākṣasa: “I
  desire to fight, O dull-witted one—single combat with you.”
'11': >-
  “I am the son of Daśaratha, the brother of wise Rāma—Śatrughna, ever the
  slayer of enemies—come here desiring your death.”
'12': >-
  “Therefore, to me who am eager for battle, grant this duel. You are an enemy
  of all beings; you shall not depart from here alive.”
'13': >-
  When he spoke thus, the rākṣasa, as though laughing aloud, replied to the best
  of men: “By good fortune you have come, O evil-minded one!”
'14': >-
  “Rāvaṇa, the lord of rākṣasas, the brother of my mother’s sister, was slain by
  Rāma, O foolish one—because of a woman, O vilest of men!”
'15': >-
  “Yet I have endured all that—the destruction of Rāvaṇa’s lineage—having set
  aside the insult; but you men, in particular, have been treated with contempt
  by me.”
'16': >-
  “Indeed, all of mine have been slain—trampled and made as nothing, like blades
  of grass; and you too—men of the past and men yet to be, and you yourself—are
  vilest of men.”
'17': >-
  “To you, eager for battle, I shall give battle, O foolish one. Stand for a
  moment, while I fetch my weapons—until I arm myself with such weapons as you
  desire, and make them ready.”
'18': >-
  Śatrughna swiftly said to him: “Where will you go alive from me? An enemy
  encountered by chance is not to be released by a man of steady self-mastery.”
'19': >-
  “For he who, with wavering judgment, grants an enemy room and opportunity—he
  is slain through foolishness, just like a cowardly man.”
'20': >-
  “Therefore, take a good look upon the world of the living: with sharp and
  various arrows I shall send you forth—O sinful one—toward Yama’s abode, you
  who are an enemy of the three worlds and of Rāghava.”
'21': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-eighth chapter of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Dispute between Lavaṇa and
  Śatrughna.”
