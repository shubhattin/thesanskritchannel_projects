'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (Paramātman).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': >-
  Now, the Sixteenth Chapter: The Yoga of the Division between the Divine and
  the Demoniac Endowments.
'3': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'4': >-
  Fearlessness; purity of being; steadfastness in the Yoga of knowledge;
  charity; self-restraint; sacrifice; study of the sacred lore; austerity; and
  straightforwardness—
'5': >-
  Non-violence; truthfulness; absence of anger; renunciation; peace; absence of
  slander; compassion toward all beings; freedom from covetousness; gentleness;
  modesty; and absence of fickleness—
'6': >-
  Vigour (spiritual splendour); forgiveness; fortitude; purity; absence of
  hatred; and absence of excessive pride—these belong to the one born with the
  divine endowment, O Bhārata.
'7': >-
  Hypocrisy; arrogance; self-conceit; anger; harshness; and ignorance—these, O
  Pārtha, belong to the one born with the demoniac endowment.
'8': >-
  The divine endowment is held to be for liberation, and the demoniac is
  considered for bondage. Grieve not, O Pāṇḍava—you are born with the divine
  endowment.
'9': >-
  There are two kinds of created beings in this world—the divine and the
  demoniac. The divine has been spoken of in detail; now hear from Me about the
  demoniac, O Pārtha.
'10': >-
  The demoniac people do not know what is to be done (rightful action) and what
  is to be refrained from (rightful abstention). Neither purity, nor proper
  conduct, nor truth is found in them.
'11': >-
  They say that the world is without truth, without a moral foundation, without
  a Lord; born not of any righteous order, but from mutual union alone—what else
  but desire as its cause?
'12': >-
  Holding fast to this view, these lost-souled people of little
  understanding—becoming engaged in dreadful actions—arise as enemies of the
  world, for its destruction.
'13': >-
  Taking refuge in insatiable desire, possessed of hypocrisy, pride, and
  intoxication of arrogance, they—deluded—cling to false notions and proceed
  with impure vows and observances.
'14': >-
  Resorting to immeasurable anxieties that endure until the end of life, taking
  enjoyment of sense-objects as their highest aim, convinced that ‘this alone is
  all’—
'15': >-
  Bound by hundreds of fetters of hope, devoted to desire and anger, they strive
  to amass wealth by unjust means for the sake of sensual enjoyment.
'16': >-
  ‘This has been gained by me today; this desire I shall fulfil; this wealth is
  mine, and this also shall be mine again in the future.’
'17': >-
  ‘That enemy has been slain by me, and I shall slay others also. I am the lord;
  I am the enjoyer; I am successful; I am powerful and happy.’
'18': >-
  ‘I am wealthy and of noble birth; who else is equal to me? I shall sacrifice,
  I shall give, I shall rejoice’—thus deluded by ignorance,
'19': >-
  Bewildered by many thoughts, enveloped in the net of delusion, intensely
  attached to pleasures of desire, they fall into an impure hell.
'20': >-
  Self-exalting, stubborn, filled with the intoxication of wealth and pride,
  they perform sacrifices in name only—out of hypocrisy, and not according to
  prescribed rule.
'21': >-
  Resorting to egoism, power, arrogance, desire, and anger, they hate Me, ever
  finding fault, in their own bodies and in the bodies of others.
'22': >-
  Those hateful, cruel ones—the lowest among men in the world—those ever impure,
  I cast continually into demoniac wombs in saṁsāra.
'23': >-
  Entering demoniac births, deluded from birth to birth, and not attaining Me, O
  son of Kuntī, they then go to the lowest state.
'24': >-
  This is the threefold gate of hell, destructive of the self: desire, anger,
  and greed. Therefore, one should abandon these three.
'25': >-
  Freed from these three gates of darkness, O son of Kuntī, a person practises
  what leads to his own highest good; thereafter he attains the Supreme Goal.
'26': >-
  He who, casting aside the ordinances of scripture, acts under the impulse of
  desire—he attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the Supreme Goal.
'27': >-
  Therefore, let scripture be your authority in determining what ought to be
  done and what ought not to be done. Knowing what is declared by the
  injunctions of scripture, you ought to perform action here in this world.
'28': >-
  “Om Tat Sat”—thus in the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, among the Upaniṣads, in the
  Brahma-vidyā (science of the Absolute), in the Yoga-śāstra, in the dialogue
  between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, ends the Sixteenth Chapter entitled “The Yoga of
  the Division between the Divine and the Demoniac Endowments.”
