  Now begins the second canto, named “Sugrīva’s Counsel,” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa
  of the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Seeing those two great-souled brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—heroic warriors
  bearing excellent weapons—Sugrīva became filled with apprehension.
'2': >-
  With his heart agitated, the foremost of monkeys looked about in every
  direction, and could not remain settled in any one place.
'3': >-
  Nor could he compose his mind, as he gazed upon those two mighty men; the mind
  of that monkey, terrified to the utmost, sank into dejection indeed.
'4': >-
  Having reflected, that righteous-souled Sugrīva, weighing what was heavy and
  what was light (what was grave and what was trivial), became exceedingly
  disturbed, together with all those monkeys.
'5': >-
  Then Sugrīva, lord of the hosts that leap, seeing Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, spoke in
  great agitation to his ministers.
'6': >-
  “These two have surely been sent by Vāli into this difficult forest; disguised
  in bark-garments, they have come here, moving about.”
'7': >-
  Then the ministers of Sugrīva, seeing the two supreme archers, went from that
  mountainside to another excellent peak.
'8': >-
  Having swiftly approached, the leaders of the troops—monkeys—gathered around
  the best of monkeys, the bull among troop-leaders, and stood attending upon
  him.
'9': >-
  Thus, moving along a single route, leaping from mountain to mountain, they
  shook with their speed the summits of the mountains as well.
'10': >-
  Then all those powerful monkeys, leaping about, broke there the flowering
  trees upon the mountains that rose in those hard-to-reach places.
'11': >-
  Leaping all around that great mountain, those excellent monkeys then went on,
  frightening the deer, the wildcats, and the tigers.
'12': >-
  Then the ministers of Sugrīva, assembled upon the lordly mountain, met with
  the chief of monkeys; and all stood with joined palms.
'13': >-
  Then Hanumān, skilled in speech, addressed Sugrīva—terrified by fear, and
  suspecting danger from Vāli’s offence—with these words:
'14': >-
  “Let this great alarm on account of Vāli be cast off by all. This is the
  excellent mountain Malaya; here there is no fear from Vāli.”
'15': >-
  “Since, O foremost of monkeys, you have fled with an anxious mind, I do not
  see here that Vāli—cruel, of cruel aspect.”
'16': >-
  “Since, dear one, your fear arises from earlier evil deeds, that wicked-souled
  Vāli is not here; I do not see any cause for your fear here.”
'17': >-
  “Ah! Your very nature as a branch-roaming beast is manifest, O ranger of the
  woods—since, through fickleness of mind, you do not steady yourself in
  resolve.”
'18': >-
  “Endowed with intelligence and discernment, act in every matter by observing
  signs and gestures; for a king who has fallen into folly does not truly govern
  all beings.”
'19': >-
  Sugrīva, having heard all those auspicious words of Hanumān, then spoke to
  Hanumān words even more fitting and auspicious.
'20': >-
  “Long-armed, wide-eyed, bearing arrows, bow, and sword—who would not feel fear
  on seeing these two, who are like sons of the gods?”
'21': >-
  “I suspect, O best of men, that they have indeed been dispatched by Vāli.
  Kings have many allies, and in such a matter trust is not proper.”
'22': >-
  “Enemies are to be recognized as men who move in disguise. Even those who are
  trusted—if untrustworthy—strike at the vulnerable points.”
'23': >-
  “Vāli is skilled in expedients; kings are far-seeing. Those who become slayers
  of others—such men are to be recognized by simple folk.”
'24': >-
  “Therefore you, going as though an ordinary monkey, should ascertain these
  two, O ranger of the woods—by the varieties of their gestures, by their form,
  and by their manner of speech.”
'25': >-
  “Mark their disposition—whether their minds are glad—and, winning their
  confidence by praises and by repeated signs (friendly gestures), again and
  again.”
'26': >-
  “Standing facing me, O foremost of monkeys, you should ask those two bowmen
  the purpose of their entry into this forest.”
'27': >-
  “If these two are pure in heart, then know it, O ranger of the woods; by their
  speech or by their appearance the wickedness in them, if any, is to be
  discerned.”
'28': >-
  Thus instructed by the king of monkeys, the son of the Wind-god resolved to go
  to where Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were.
'29': >-
  “So be it,”—thus honoring the words of that exceedingly frightened and
  unapproachable monkey—great-souled Hanumān then went there, where was Rāma of
  surpassing strength, together with Lakṣmaṇa.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the second canto, named “Sugrīva’s Counsel,” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa
  of the venerable Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
