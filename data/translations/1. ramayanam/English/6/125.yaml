  Now begins the one-hundred-and-twenty-fifth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the
  holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Ascent of the Puṣpaka (Aerial Car).”
'1': >-
  Having had the Puṣpaka—adorned with flowers—made ready and brought near,
  Vibhīṣaṇa, standing not far away, spoke these words to Rāma:
'2': >-
  Then the lord of the rākṣasas, with palms joined in reverence, humble and
  courteous, spoke to Rāghava in haste: “What shall I do?”
'3': >-
  While Lakṣmaṇa listened nearby, the mighty Rāghava, after due reflection,
  spoke to him this affectionate word, born of regard:
'4': >-
  “All these forest-dwellers have accomplished their labor and achieved the
  purpose. Do you, Vibhīṣaṇa, have them all honored with various jewels and
  riches.
'5': >-
  “Along with your allies, O lord of the rākṣasas, Laṅkā has been conquered—by
  those who are joyful, who have cast away the fear of death, and who do not
  turn back from battles.
'6': >-
  “All these forest-dwellers here have completed the work undertaken. By
  granting wealth and jewels, make their service bear fruit.”
'7': >-
  “When thus honored by you and duly praised, these leaders of the monkey hosts
  will be satisfied, for you are grateful.”
'8': >-
  “All men resort to one who is generous, who gathers and holds others together,
  who is compassionate, and who has conquered his senses. Therefore I instruct
  you thus.
'9': >-
  “But an army, alarmed and distressed, abandons that king, O lord of men, who
  is bereft of every winning virtue and who is merely a slayer in battle.”
'10': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, Vibhīṣaṇa honored all those vānaras by distributing
  jewels and wealth among them.
'11': >-
  Then, seeing those leaders of monkey hosts honored with jewels and riches,
  Rāma ascended that unsurpassed aerial car.
'12': >-
  Taking Vaidehī upon his lap—she, the high-minded lady, bashful—Rāma sat there
  together with his brother Lakṣmaṇa, the valiant archer.
'13': >-
  Seated in the aerial car, while honoring all the vānaras, the Kakutstha
  spoke—to Sugrīva of great valor, and also to Vibhīṣaṇa:
'14': >-
  “This duty of friendship has been accomplished by you, O bulls among vānaras.
  All of you are released by me—depart as you desire.”
'15': >-
  “And whatever task was done by the friend—affectionate, well-wishing, and
  dear—O Sugrīva, all that has been done by you, who are fearful of adharma.”
'16': >-
  “Go quickly toward Kiṣkindhā, surrounded by your army. And you, Vibhīṣaṇa,
  dwell in your own kingdom in Laṅkā, which has been bestowed by me. Even the
  dwellers in heaven, though led by Indra, are not able to overpower you.”
'17': >-
  “I shall go toward Ayodhyā, the capital city of my father. I wish to take
  leave—therefore I bid you all farewell.”
'18': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, the monkey kings and the monkeys likewise, and the
  rākṣasa Vibhīṣaṇa as well, all with joined palms, spoke:
'19': >-
  “We wish to go to Ayodhyā. Let your lordship take us all there. We shall roam
  about delighted—through forests and groves.”
'20': >-
  “Having seen you, moistened by the waters of consecration at your coronation,
  and having paid homage to Kausalyā, we shall soon return to our own homes, O
  best of kings.”
'21': >-
  Thus spoken to by the vānaras together with Vibhīṣaṇa, righteous-souled Rāma
  said to the vānaras—along with Sugrīva and Vibhīṣaṇa:
'22': >-
  “I have gained something dearer than the dearest—namely that, together with
  all my friends and kinsmen, and accompanied by all of you, I shall attain joy
  on reaching the city.”
'23': >-
  “Quickly ascend the aerial car, O Sugrīva, along with the vānaras. And you too
  ascend with your ministers, O rākṣasa-king Vibhīṣaṇa.”
'24': >-
  Then Sugrīva, together with the vānaras, gladly mounted that divine Puṣpaka;
  and Vibhīṣaṇa too mounted, along with his ministers.
'25': >-
  When all had mounted, that foremost seat of Kubera, having received Rāghava’s
  permission, sprang up into the sky.
'26': >-
  In that radiant aerial car moving through the heavens, yoked with swans,
  Rāma—exceedingly delighted and content—shone forth like Kubera himself.
'27': >-
  All those mighty ones—vānaras, bears, and rākṣasas—sat at ease, uncramped and
  unhindered, within that divine aerial car.
'28': >-
  Thus ends, in the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the one-hundred-and-twenty-fifth sarga, entitled “The Ascent of
  the Puṣpaka.”
