  Now begins the Fifty-fifth Sarga, named “The Crossing of the Yamunā,” in the
  Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Having dwelt there for that night, the two princes—subduers of foes—then paid
  obeisance to the great sage and set out towards that mountain.
'2': >-
  And the great sage duly performed for them the rites and blessings for a safe
  and auspicious journey; and, watching them depart, he followed after them for
  a while, as a father follows his sons.
'3': >-
  Thereupon that mighty ascetic, Bharadvāja of great splendour, began to speak
  words of counsel to Rāma, whose valour is ever true to his word.
'4': >-
  Reaching the confluence of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā, O best of men, you should
  then follow the river Kālindī (Yamunā), keeping to the western-facing course
  of its stream.
'5': >-
  Then, having come to Kālindī—the river of swift current—(and approaching) the
  bank where the stream meets you as you go against its flow, the two Rāghavas
  beheld an ancient and well-frequented ford upon that river.
'6': >-
  There you should make a raft and cross that radiant river. Thereafter,
  reaching a great banyan tree with fresh green foliage,
'7': >-
  grown vast, surrounded by many trees, dark-hued, and honoured by perfected
  beings (siddhas), to that tree Sītā should offer her reverent salutation with
  joined palms and pray for auspicious blessings.
'8': >-
  Having reached that tree, you may rest there—or pass beyond it; then, going a
  distance of a krośa, you will behold a dark-blue forest.
'9': >-
  Delightful, mingled with palāśa and badarī trees, and with bamboos along the
  Yamunā; that is the path to Citrakūṭa which I have traversed many times.
'10': >-
  It is a fair path, easy to tread, and free from the afflictions caused by
  forest-conflagrations. Having thus described the way, the great sage turned
  back.
'11': >-
  Rāma, having saluted him and saying, “So be it,” dismissed him; and when that
  sage had returned, Rāma spoke to Lakṣmaṇa:
'12': >-
  “We are truly fortunate, O Saumitri, in that the sage shows us compassion.”
  Thus the two high-souled tigers among men took counsel together,
'13': >-
  and placing Sītā foremost, they went to the river Kālindī. Then, having
  reached Kālindī, the river that bears a swift current,
'14': those two set about making a great raft from a mass of timber.
'15': >-
  It was strewn with dried bamboos and covered over with reeds; then the valiant
  Lakṣmaṇa also cut and added branches of vetasa and branches of jambu,
'16': >-
  and, after cutting them, he fashioned for Sītā a comfortable seat. There the
  son of Daśaratha, Rāma, looked upon his beloved—like Lakṣmī herself, beyond
  all reckoning in splendour.
'17': >-
  Then, arranging the raft properly and securing the necessary articles, he
  placed beside Vaidehī her garments and other essentials (to keep them safe and
  dry).
'18': >-
  And Rāma also, together with their weapons, made the raft firm and fit for
  crossing. First placing Sītā upon it, and then taking hold of the raft
  together, the two (brothers) began to guide it.
'19': >-
  Thereafter the two heroes, sons of Daśaratha, propelled the raft onward; and
  when they had reached the middle of Kālindī, Sītā paid reverence to the river.
'20': >-
  “May auspiciousness be yours, O goddess! I cross over you; may my husband’s
  vow be fulfilled! When my desire is accomplished, I shall worship you with a
  thousand cows and with a hundred jars of surā.”
'21': >-
  “May auspiciousness be ours when Rāma returns to the city protected by the
  Ikṣvāku line!” Thus did Sītā, with joined palms, pray to Kālindī.
'22': >-
  And that fair-complexioned lady reached the southern bank. Then, by that raft,
  (crossing) the radiant river—swift-going and wreathed with waves—
'23': >-
  they crossed the Yamunā, aided by many trees growing upon the banks. Having
  crossed, they left the raft behind and set forth from the Yamunā-woodland.
'24': >-
  They reached a dark-hued banyan, cool and shaded with green leaves.
  Approaching that banyan, Vaidehī spoke these words:
'25': >-
  “Salutation to you, O great tree! May my husband’s vow be fulfilled; and may I
  behold Kauśalyā and the illustrious Sumitrā again.”
'26': >-
  Thus having made her salutation with joined palms, Sītā circumambulated that
  lord of trees. Then, seeing Sītā—blameless—thus praying,
'27': >-
  Rāma spoke to Lakṣmaṇa, (about) his beloved who was gentle and obedient:
  “Taking Sītā, do you go in front, O younger brother of Bharata.
'28': >-
  I shall go behind, armed, O best among bipeds. Whatever fruit or flower the
  daughter of Janaka may desire,
'29': >-
  give that, that very thing, to Vaidehī—wherever her mind finds delight.” As
  the two brothers walked on, Janaka’s daughter came between them,
'30': >-
  like a noble young elephant-cow moving between two mighty tuskers. She looked
  at each tree in turn, or shrub, or flowering creeper,
'31': >-
  and, seeing many charming trees laden with blossoms—such as she had never seen
  before—that delicate lady questioned Rāma about them.
'32': >-
  At Sītā’s words, Lakṣmaṇa led them onward to a place with marvellous sandy
  banks and waters, resonant with the calls of swans and cranes.
'33': >-
  Then the daughter of King Janaka delighted in beholding that river. After they
  had gone a distance of a krośa, the two brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
'34': >-
  slew many pure (fit-for-offering) deer and ranged about in the woodland along
  the Yamunā. Sporting there, in that auspicious forest resounding with flocks
  of peacocks, thronged with monkeys and elephants, they reached, as agreed, a
  suitable spot by the river-bank and made their dwelling there—the two who
  delight in beholding streams and rivers.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the Fifty-fifth Sarga, named “The Crossing of the Yamunā,” in the
  Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of the sacred Rāmāyaṇa, the work of Vālmīki, the primeval epic.
