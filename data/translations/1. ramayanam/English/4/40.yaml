  Now begins the fortieth canto in the Kishkindha-kanda of the glorious
  Valmiki-Ramayana, entitled “The Dispatch to the Eastern Quarter.”
'1': >-
  Then King Sugriva, lord of the monkeys, whose purpose had prospered, spoke to
  Rama—the tiger among men, the destroyer of foes’ strength:
'2': >-
  “Mighty monkey-lords, able to assume forms at will, have come and taken their
  seats—those who dwell within my realm, radiant like Mahendra himself.
'3': >-
  These fierce monkeys have arrived—many of them great heroes, strong and of
  dreadful prowess—terrible to behold, resembling Daityas and Danavas.
'4': >-
  They are renowned for their deeds and exploits; strong, tireless, famed for
  valor in battle, and excellent in resolve and enterprise.
'5': >-
  O Rama, these are dwellers on earth and in waters, inhabiting various
  mountains; and crores and hosts of such monkeys—your servants—have assembled
  here.
'6': >-
  All are obedient to command; all stand intent upon their elder’s welfare; and,
  O subduer of enemies, they will be able to carry out what you desire.
'7': >-
  These terrible monkeys have come with many thousands of divisions, of fearful
  prowess—fierce like Daityas and Danavas.
'8': >-
  Whatever you deem timely, O tiger among men—let that be spoken. This army is
  disciplined under your control; you are worthy to command it.
'9': >-
  Indeed, their task is fully known to me in truth; yet even so, you are worthy
  to direct them in the proper manner.
'10': >-
  As Sugriva spoke thus, Rama, son of Dasharatha, embraced him with both arms
  and spoke these words:
'11': >-
  “Let it be ascertained, gentle friend, whether Vaidehi lives or does not live;
  and also that land, O greatly wise one, wherein Ravana dwells.
'12': >-
  And having found Vaidehi and also the abode of Ravana, at the proper time, in
  that time, I shall act together with you.
'13': >-
  In this matter neither I nor Lakshmana is the master, O lord of monkeys. You
  are the cause of this undertaking and the master as well, O sovereign of the
  Vanaras.
'14': >-
  Therefore you yourself, O mighty one, command the execution of my purpose. For
  you know my task, O hero—of that there is no doubt.
'15': >-
  Valiant, wise, knowing the distinctions of time, a friend and
  companion—devoted to our welfare, a trusted well-wisher, and best among those
  who know what is advantageous—such are you.
'16': >-
  Thus addressed, Sugriva spoke to the troop-leader named Vinata, in the
  presence of Rama and the wise Lakshmana:
'17': >-
  “O best of monkeys, take with you that powerful lord of the monkeys,
  mountain-like and thunderous as a cloud, along with monkeys radiant like the
  moon and the sun;
'18': >-
  and he—skilled in deciding what is to be done, equipped with knowledge of
  place, time, and policy—shall be accompanied by a hundred thousand swift and
  mighty monkeys.
'19': >-
  Proceed to the eastern direction, with its mountains, forests, and groves; and
  there seek Sita Vaidehi and also the dwelling-place of Ravana.
'20': >-
  Search in mountain fastnesses, in forests, and in rivers—along the lovely
  river Bhagirathi, and Sarayu, and also Kaushiki;
'21': >-
  the beautiful Kalindi, Yamuna, and the great mountain called Yamuna as well;
  and Sarasvati and Sindhu, and the Shona whose waters gleam like jewels;
'22': >-
  and the land called Mahi and also Kalamahi adorned with woods and mountains;
  the Brahmamalas and the Videhas, the Malavas, the Kashi and Kosala regions;
'23': >-
  and the Magadhas with their great villages; the Pundras and the Angas too; and
  the land of the weavers, and the land of the silver-mines;
'24': >-
  and all those places are to be thoroughly examined, searching here and there,
  for Sita—Rama’s beloved wife, the daughter-in-law of Dasharatha.
'25': >-
  Examine also mountains that plunge into the sea, and cities and ports; and
  those dwellings that some have made, clinging to the flank of Mandara
  mountain.
'26': >-
  There are also beings with ears that cover them like cloaks, and others with
  lips and ears of monstrous size; and dreadful ones with faces of iron; and the
  Javanas, and beings with but one foot.
'27': >-
  And the Akshayas—mighty ones—as well as man-eaters; Kiratas with sharp
  topknots, golden-hued and pleasing to behold;
'28': >-
  Kiratas too who eat raw fish, dwellers on islands; terrible beings who move
  within the waters—these, it is said, are ‘tigers among men.’
'29': >-
  All the haunts of these forest-dwellers are to be investigated—places
  approached by mountains, and by leaps and bounds, and by springing from crag
  to crag.
'30': >-
  With effort, explore Yavadvipa, adorned by seven kingdoms; and also the island
  rich in gold and silver, embellished with mines of gold.
'31': >-
  Having passed beyond Yavadvipa, there is a mountain named Shishira, whose peak
  touches the heavens, frequented by gods and Danavas.
'32': >-
  In these mountain-forts, at waterfalls, and in forests, all of you together
  must search for the illustrious wife of Rama.
'33': >-
  Then, having reached the swiftly flowing river called Shona, with its
  blood-red waters, and having gone to the farther shore of the ocean, a region
  frequented by Siddhas and Charanas,
'34': >-
  in its lovely fords and in its diverse forests, Ravana together with Vaidehi
  must be sought repeatedly, searching place by place.
'35': >-
  Rivers springing from mountains, very formidable and with many thickets;
  caverns, mountains, and forests—these must be searched.
'36': >-
  Thereafter you must behold the fearsome islands of the ocean, and the sea
  itself—full of waves, greatly terrible, roaring, driven by the wind.
'37': >-
  There colossal Asuras, ever hungry for a long time, seize upon
  shadows—permitted by Brahma to do so—day after day.
'38': >-
  Approaching that great-sounding ocean, vast and dark like a rain-cloud at the
  end of time, frequented by mighty serpents, cross it by a ford alone.
'39': >-
  Then you shall reach the dreadful sea named Lohita, with its blood-red waters;
  and you shall behold also that immense silk-cotton tree with a lofty crest
  (Kuta-shalmali).
'40': >-
  And you shall see the abode of Vainateya (Garuda), adorned with many kinds of
  jewels—made by Vishvakarman, resembling Mount Kailasa.
'41': >-
  There dwell the terrible rakshasas called Mandehas, mountain-like in form, of
  many shapes and fearsome; they hang down from the mountain-peaks.
'42': >-
  They fall into the waters every day, facing the rising of the sun; scorched by
  the sun’s heat, they hang again and again, repeatedly.
'43': >-
  Struck down day after day by the blazing energy of Brahma, those rakshasas are
  destroyed; then you shall reach the ocean named Kshiroda, white like a pale
  cloud.
'44': >-
  There, O unconquerable ones, you shall behold it—its waves like strings of
  pearls; and in its midst is a great white mountain named Rishabha.
'45': >-
  It is surrounded by lovely peaks strewn with blossoms of divine fragrance; and
  there is a lake blazing with silver lotuses, with golden filaments.
'46': >-
  That lake is named Sudarshana, filled with royal swans; and gods, Charanas,
  Yakshas, Kinnaras, and hosts of Apsaras,
'47': >-
  delighted, go there longing to sport in that lotus-lake. Having crossed beyond
  the Milk Ocean, you monkeys shall then behold
'48': >-
  the sea called Jaloda—swift, and terrifying to all beings. There the mighty
  energy born of its wrath has taken the form of a great mare-faced fire.
'49': >-
  They say its tremendous, impetuous force consumes the world, with all that
  moves and does not move. There is heard the clamorous cries of beings dwelling
  in the sea; and those who are powerless, upon seeing the mare-faced fire,
  become overwhelmed.
'50': >-
  On the northern shore of the Sweet-water ocean, at a distance of thirteen
  yojanas, there is a very great mountain called Jatarupashila, resplendent with
  the radiance of gold.
'51': >-
  There, O monkeys, you shall behold a serpent, a mountain-bearer, shining like
  the moon, with eyes vast like lotus-leaves;
'52': >-
  seated on the mountain’s summit, worshipped by all the gods—the deity Ananta,
  thousand-headed, clad in blue.
'53': >-
  A golden banner with three heads, and a palm-standard belonging to that
  great-souled one, is set upon the mountain-top, shining, with its altar-base.
'54': >-
  In the eastern direction that structure was fashioned by the lords of the
  thirty gods; beyond it lies the glorious Udaya Mountain, made of gold.
'55': >-
  Its flank, stretching a hundred yojanas, touches the heavens; and a divine
  platform of gold stands resplendent there.
'56': >-
  With flowering sala, tala, tamala, and karnikara trees—divine and
  golden—shining like the sun, it is beautified.
'57': >-
  There is a peak named Saumanasa, fixed and wholly of gold, ten yojanas high
  and one yojana in breadth.
'58': >-
  There, in ancient times, Vishnu, in his three strides, placed his first step;
  and the Supreme Person placed the second upon the peak of Meru.
'59': >-
  Circling Jambudvipa on its northern side, the Sun becomes visible there in
  fullest measure—upon that exceedingly lofty summit.
'60': >-
  There the great sages called Vaikhanasas, the Valakhilyas—ascetics shining
  forth, of the color of the sun—are seen.
'61': >-
  This island called Sudarshana shines in front of it; in it abide radiance and
  sight even for all living beings.
'62': >-
  Upon the ridges of that mountain, in its caves, hollows, and forests, Ravana
  together with Vaidehi must be searched for, place by place.
'63': >-
  On that golden mountain and around the great-souled Sun, the eastern twilight,
  pervaded by his splendor, appears red and luminous.
'64': >-
  This is declared to be the eastern quarter—the gateway made of old for the
  earth and the world, and also the place of the Sun’s rising.
'65': >-
  On the backs of that mountain—in its cascades and caverns—Ravana together with
  Vaidehi must be searched for, again and again.
'66': >-
  Beyond that, the eastern direction becomes exceedingly difficult to
  traverse—encircled by the gods—devoid of moon and sun, unseen, shrouded in
  darkness.
'67': >-
  In all those mountains, in their caves and in their rivers, and in the regions
  not mentioned by me, Janaki must be searched for.
'68': >-
  So far only is it possible for monkeys to go, O foremost of monkeys. Beyond
  that we do not know—where there is no sun, without bounds and beyond rule.
'69': >-
  Having found Vaidehi and also the abode of Ravana, return when a full month is
  completed, reaching Udaya Mountain.
'70': >-
  You must not remain beyond a month; if any stays, he shall be liable to death
  by my command. Having achieved your purpose and found Maithili, return.
'71': >-
  Having traversed that direction lovely as Mahendra and adorned with groves, O
  skilled monkeys, once you obtain Sita, beloved of the descendant of Raghu,
  then returning, you shall be happy.
'72': >-
  Thus ends the fortieth canto in the Kishkindha-kanda of the sacred,
  illustrious Ramayana composed by Valmiki, the first poet, entitled “The
  Dispatch to the Eastern Quarter.”
