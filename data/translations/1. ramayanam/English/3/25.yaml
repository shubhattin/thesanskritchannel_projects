  Then, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, the twenty-fifth
  canto, entitled “The Crushing of Khara’s Army.”
'1': >-
  Khara, together with those who went before him, came up to the hermitage and
  beheld Rāma—his bow firmly braced, inflamed with wrath, and a slayer of foes.
'2': >-
  Seeing him with his bow strung, and hearing that dreadful sound of Khara, he
  commanded his charioteer, “Drive the chariot straight against Rāma!”
'3': >-
  Thus ordered by Khara, the charioteer urged on the horses toward the place
  where mighty-armed Rāma stood alone, twanging and shaking his bow.
'4': >-
  But when they saw him rushing forth, the night-rangers, raising a great uproar
  on every side, surrounded him—his counsellors hemming him in.
'5': >-
  Amidst those rākṣasas, Khara, stationed upon his chariot, shone forth in their
  midst like the red-limbed sun rising among the stars.
'6': >-
  Then Khara, assailing Rāma of incomparable prowess with a thousand arrows,
  roared a mighty roar upon the battlefield.
'7': >-
  Thereupon, all those night-rangers, enraged at that wielder of the terrible
  bow, rained upon unconquerable Rāma weapons of many kinds.
'8': >-
  With iron maces, tridents, spears, swords, and axes, the rākṣasas—intent on
  their fury—struck at the heroic one in battle.
'9': >-
  Those huge-bodied, mighty-strong rākṣasas, resembling rain-clouds, charged at
  Kakutstha in chariots and with horsemen as well.
'10': >-
  And with elephants like mountain-peaks, desiring to slay Rāma in fight, those
  bands of rākṣasas discharged showers of arrows at him.
'11': >-
  Like great clouds pouring torrents upon a mountain-lord, Rāma was surrounded
  on every side by rākṣasas of cruel aspect.
'12': >-
  As Mahādeva on holy days is encompassed by hosts of his attendants, so
  Rāghava, facing the weapons hurled by the night-rangers—
'13': >-
  —received them with his keen shafts, even as the ocean receives the rushing
  floods of rivers; and though his limbs were struck by those dreadful missiles,
  he did not waver.
'14': >-
  Like a mighty mountain struck by many blazing thunderbolts, so was Rāghava
  pierced—his whole body smeared with blood.
'15': >-
  Rāma appeared as the sun enveloped by twilight-clouds; and the gods,
  gandharvas, siddhas, and great seers were cast into despondency.
'16': >-
  Seeing the one hero hemmed in then by thousands on every side, Rāma grew
  exceedingly enraged and wheeled his bow in a circle.
'17': >-
  Thereafter he launched hundreds and then thousands of sharp
  arrows—irresistible, unbearable, like the noose of Time itself in battle.
'18': >-
  With effortless ease he loosed arrows feathered with heron-plumes and adorned
  with gold; and those shafts, released by Rāma as though in sport, flew into
  the enemy hosts.
'19': >-
  They seized away the lives of the rākṣasas like snares fashioned by Death; and
  after piercing those rākṣasa bodies, those arrows were drenched in blood.
'20': >-
  In mid-air they shone with the splendour of blazing fire—those countless
  missiles of Rāma that issued from the circle of his bow.
'21': >-
  Most fierce, and stealing the very breath of the rākṣasas, they darted forth;
  and by them were shattered bows, banner-tops, shields, and coats of mail.
'22': >-
  Arms adorned with bracelets, thighs like the trunks of elephants—Rāma in
  battle hewed them down by hundreds and by thousands.
'23': >-
  Horses harnessed to chariots with golden trappings, together with their
  charioteers; elephants along with their riders; and horsemen with their
  mounts—then,
'24': >-
  —all these were cut down and pierced by Rāma’s arrows, slipped from the
  bowstring; and having slain the foot-soldiers in battle, he sent them to
  Yama’s abode.
'25': >-
  Then, being cut down by barbed shafts and iron arrows with sharp points and
  forked heads, the night-rangers raised a dreadful cry of anguish.
'26': >-
  That army, tormented by diverse arrows that split vital parts, found no ease
  at Rāma’s hands—like a dry forest in the grip of fire.
'27': >-
  Some rākṣasas, of terrible strength and heroic, in supreme fury hurled spears,
  tridents, and axes at Rāma.
'28': >-
  But the mighty-armed, valiant one warded off their weapons with his arrows,
  took away their lives in battle, and severed their heads.
'29': >-
  With heads cut off, with shields and bows severed, they fell—like trees on the
  earth scattered by the wind of Garuḍa’s wings.
'30': >-
  And those night-rangers who remained there, struck by arrows and utterly
  downcast, ran only toward Khara, seeking refuge.
'31': >-
  Then Dūṣaṇa, taking up his bow and giving them encouragement, rushed forward
  in great wrath—like Death himself enraged against one who is enraged.
'32': >-
  Then, regaining courage by resorting to Dūṣaṇa, all of them turned back again
  without fear and charged at Rāma, bearing sāla and tāla trees and rocks as
  weapons.
'33': >-
  Greatly powerful, some with tridents and maces in hand, some holding nooses,
  they poured forth showers of arrows and showers of weapons in the melee.
'34': >-
  Casting down showers of trees and showers of stones, the rākṣasas made that
  battle wondrous—tumultuous and hair-raising.
'35': >-
  In that exceedingly terrible fight of Rāma against those rākṣasas, they,
  enraged on every side, again oppressed Rāghava.
'36': >-
  Then, seeing all the directions and the intermediate quarters covered, with
  rākṣasas arriving from every side, he was enveloped by showers of arrows.
'37': >-
  Uttering a fearsome cry, that mighty one invoked the supremely radiant
  Gāndharva weapon against the rākṣasas.
'38': >-
  Then thousands of arrows streamed forth from the circle of his bow, and all
  the ten directions were filled with those converging shafts.
'39': >-
  The rākṣasas—tormented by arrows—beheld him drawing and releasing dreadful
  shafts, the finest of missiles, without ceasing.
'40': >-
  The sky was covered over with the darkness of arrows, as though without the
  sun; and Rāma stood as if casting forth those arrows in an unbroken torrent.
'41': >-
  With multitudes falling at once, and multitudes being violently slain at once,
  and multitudes collapsing at once, the earth became strewn and scattered.
'42': >-
  Slain, fallen, exhausted; severed, split, and torn—there and there were seen
  those rākṣasas by the thousand.
'43': >-
  With turbans and heads, with arms still bearing armlets, with thighs and arms
  cut off—together with ornaments of many shapes,
'44': >-
  —with horses, and foremost elephants, and many shattered chariots; with
  yak-tail fans, parasols, and banners of diverse kinds as well,
'45': >-
  —smitten by Rāma’s arrows; with tridents and battle-axes sundered; with swords
  broken to pieces; with spears scattered; with axes strewn about,
'46': >-
  —and with rocks crushed and with many wondrous shafts, the battlefield ground
  lay spread out, torn asunder, vast and terrifying.
'47': >-
  Seeing them all slain, the rākṣasas were in extreme distress; there they were
  not able even to move against Rāma, the conqueror of enemy strongholds.
'48': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fifth canto, called “The Crushing of Khara’s Army,” in
  the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
