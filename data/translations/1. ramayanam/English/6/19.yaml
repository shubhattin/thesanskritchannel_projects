  Now, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  nineteenth sarga, called “The Lying Down upon a Bed of Arrows.”
'1': >-
  When fearlessness (assurance of safety) had been granted by Rāghava, the
  younger brother of Rāvaṇa—Vibhīṣaṇa, the highly wise—bowed down and looked
  upon the ground.
'2': >-
  Rejoicing, he descended from the sky and fell upon the earth together with his
  devoted attendants. That righteous-souled Vibhīṣaṇa then prostrated himself
  before Rāma.
'3': >-
  Then he fell at (Rāma’s) feet, together with four rākṣasas, and at that time
  Vibhīṣaṇa spoke these words to Rāma:
'4': >-
  “In accordance with dharma, fitting and proper, and at this very moment
  exceedingly gladdening—(hear my case): I am the younger brother of Rāvaṇa, and
  by him I have been dishonoured.
'5': >-
  “I have come for refuge to you, the Refuge of all beings, the One worthy to be
  sought as shelter. I have renounced Laṅkā—my friends, and my riches as well.
'6': >-
  “My kingdom, my very life, and my happiness—indeed all these depend upon you.”
  Hearing his words, Rāma spoke in reply.
'7': >-
  Comforting him with gentle speech, as though drinking him in with his eyes,
  (Rāma said): “Tell me truly, as it is in reality, the strength and the
  weakness of the rākṣasas.”
'8': >-
  Thus addressed then by Rāma of unwearied deeds, that rākṣasa (Vibhīṣaṇa) began
  to relate all the might of Rāvaṇa.
'9': >-
  “Daśagrīva, the prince (among rākṣasas), has become invulnerable to all
  beings—to gandharvas, nāgas, and birds—by a boon granted by Svayambhū
  (Brahmā).”
'10': >-
  “Next to Rāvaṇa stands his brother—my elder—mighty in valour: Kumbhakarṇa, of
  great splendour, equal in battle to Śakra (Indra) in strength.”
'11': >-
  “Rāma, his army-commander is Prahasta—if you have heard of him—he by whom, in
  battle upon Kailāsa, Maṇibhadra was defeated.”
'12': >-
  “And Indrajit—whose finger-guards are made of bound iguana-hide, whose armour
  in battle is not to be pierced—taking up his bow, stands so that he becomes
  invisible.”
'13': >-
  “In war, after satisfying the Fire-god (by offerings) in a very great
  battle-array, that illustrious Indrajit, having gone into concealment, strikes
  down (his foes), O Rāghava.”
'14': >-
  “Mahodara and Mahāpārśva, and also the rākṣasa Akampana—these are his leaders
  of armies, in battle equal to the guardians of the worlds.”
'15': >-
  “Ten thousand times ten million rākṣasas—able to assume forms at will—eaters
  of flesh and blood, dwellers in the city of Laṅkā (serve him).”
'16': >-
  “With them accompanying him, that king (Rāvaṇa) fought with the guardians of
  the worlds; and they, together with the gods, were shattered by Rāvaṇa, that
  evil-souled one.”
'17': >-
  Hearing those words of Vibhīṣaṇa, the best of the Raghus reflected in his mind
  upon everything and then spoke these words:
'18': >-
  “The deeds and exploits of Rāvaṇa which you have declared in truth, O
  Vibhīṣaṇa—I understand them all as they really are.”
'19': >-
  “Having slain Daśagrīva, together with Prahasta and with his son, I shall make
  you king. This is truth—hear my vow.”
'20': >-
  “Even if Rāvaṇa were to enter Rasātala, or even Pātāla, or even go into the
  very presence of Pitāmaha (Brahmā), he shall not be released alive by me.”
'21': >-
  “Unless I slay Rāvaṇa in battle, together with his sons, his people, and his
  kinsmen, I shall not enter Ayodhyā—I swear it with those three brothers
  (beside me).”
'22': >-
  Hearing that utterance of Rāma of unwearied deeds, the righteous-souled
  (Vibhīṣaṇa), bowing his head in reverence, began to speak thus:
'23': >-
  “In the slaying of the rākṣasas and in the harrying of Laṅkā, I shall render
  aid with all my strength, and I shall enter the host (of battle) as well.”
'24': >-
  As he spoke thus, Rāma embraced Vibhīṣaṇa and, pleased, said to Lakṣmaṇa:
  “Bring water from the sea.”
'25': >-
  “And with that, quickly consecrate this highly wise Vibhīṣaṇa as king of the
  rākṣasas, O bestower of honour, since I am well-pleased.”
'26': >-
  Thus commanded, Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) consecrated Vibhīṣaṇa, in the midst of the
  foremost of the vānaras, as king, by the king’s (Rāma’s) authority.
'27': >-
  Seeing that grace bestowed by Rāma, the monkeys at once shouted aloud to that
  great-souled one, and said, “Well done! well done!”
'28': >-
  And Hanūmān and Sugrīva spoke to Vibhīṣaṇa: “How shall we cross the unagitated
  ocean, the abode of Varuṇa—while all are surrounded by our armies, the
  great-spirited vānaras?”
'29': >-
  “By what means shall we approach that lord of seas and rivers, so that we may
  all, with our forces, swiftly cross the abode of Varuṇa?”
'30': >-
  Thus addressed, the righteous-souled Vibhīṣaṇa answered: “King Rāghava ought
  to go and seek refuge with the ocean.”
'31': >-
  “This immeasurable great ocean has been dug out (fashioned) by the ocean
  itself (by its own nature and vastness); the great ocean is able to accomplish
  the task of Rāma, his kinsman (an ally who should act for him).”
'32': >-
  Thus spoken to by that discerning rākṣasa Vibhīṣaṇa, Sugrīva then went to the
  place where Rāma was, together with Lakṣmaṇa.
'33': >-
  Then Sugrīva of broad neck began to report the auspicious words of
  Vibhīṣaṇa—(namely) the counsel that Rāma should sit in supplication before the
  ocean.
'34': >-
  And this counsel pleased Rāma, whose nature is ever devoted to dharma—(Rāma),
  together with Lakṣmaṇa, and Sugrīva, the lord of the monkeys, of great
  splendour.
'35': >-
  With a smile, (Rāma) who was skilled in action and attentive to due honour,
  spoke: “This counsel of Vibhīṣaṇa pleases me, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'36': >-
  “Sugrīva is ever learned, and you are discerning in counsel. Let what seems
  proper, after being well considered by you both, be stated.”
'37': >-
  Thus addressed, those two heroes—Sugrīva and Lakṣmaṇa—then spoke this reply,
  accompanied by propriety of conduct:
'38': >-
  “For what reason, O tiger among men, would it not please us, O Rāghava—what
  Vibhīṣaṇa has spoken at this time, bringing advantage and ease?”
'39': >-
  “Without building a bridge across the sea—this dreadful abode of Varuṇa—Laṅkā
  cannot be reached, even by gods and asuras together with Indra.”
'40': >-
  “Let the true words of the valiant Vibhīṣaṇa be carried out. Enough of wasting
  time—let this ocean be employed (approached and made to assist), so that we
  may go with the army to the city protected by Rāvaṇa.”
'41': >-
  Thus addressed, upon the shore of the lord of rivers and streams, strewn with
  kuśa-grass, Rāma then lay down—like the Fire-god upon a sacrificial altar.
'42': >-
  Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Lying Down
  upon a Bed of Arrows.”
