  Then, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa, the twenty-sixth canto,
  called “The Resolution to Give Up Life (the determination to abandon the vital
  breaths).”
'1': >-
  Thus speaking, the daughter of Janaka, her face wet with ceaseless tears, the
  young maiden—her countenance turned downward—began to lament.
'2': >-
  Grieving, she moved about upon the ground like one maddened, like one
  distraught, like one whose mind is bewildered; like a young girl in confusion
  she turned back and forth, writhing restlessly on the earth.
'3': >-
  “While Rāghava was off his guard, I was seized by force—carried away, crying
  aloud—by the shape-shifting rākṣasa Rāvaṇa.”
'4': >-
  “Having fallen under the power of the rākṣasīs, and being cruelly threatened,
  I, afflicted with unbearable sorrow, reflect thus: I do not have the heart to
  go on living.”
'5': >-
  “For me there is no use in life—nor in wealth, nor in ornaments—while I dwell
  amid rākṣasīs, without Rāma, that great charioteer-warrior.”
'6': >-
  “Surely this heart of mine is made of rock-solid substance—or else it is
  ageless and deathless—since it is not shattered by sorrow.”
'7': >-
  “Fie upon me—ignoble and unchaste—that I, made thus without him, live even for
  a moment: a sinful livelihood is this living on.”
'8': >-
  “I would not touch a night-ranger even with my left foot; how much less could
  I ever desire Rāvaṇa, that blameworthy wretch!”
'9': >-
  “He who, of cruel nature, wishes to solicit me understands neither refusal,
  nor himself, nor the lineage from which he comes.”
'10': >-
  “Though I were cut, or split, or pierced through; though I were blazing, set
  aflame in fire—I would not submit myself to Rāvaṇa. Why then prolong this
  wailing?”
'11': >-
  “Rāghava is renowned—wise, grateful, and compassionate. Yet I fear that,
  through the wasting away of my own good fortune, he has become one of steady
  conduct but without compassion toward me.”
'12': >-
  “In Janasthāna there were fourteen thousand rākṣasas, and by him alone they
  were laid low. Why, then, does he not come to me?”
'13': >-
  “I have been confined by Rāvaṇa, a rākṣasa of little valor; yet my husband is
  surely capable of slaying Rāvaṇa in battle.”
'14': >-
  “Vīrādha—the bull among rākṣasas in the Daṇḍaka forest—was slain in combat by
  Rāma; why, then, does he not come to me?”
'15': >-
  “Granted, this Laṅkā in the midst of the ocean is hard to assail; yet for the
  arrows of Rāghava there will be no obstruction in their course.”
'16': >-
  “What, then, is the reason for which Rāma, of firm prowess, does not regain
  his beloved wife, carried off by a rākṣasa?”
'17': >-
  “I suspect the elder brother of Lakṣmaṇa does not know that I am here. Would
  that blazing hero, even if he knew, endure this outrage done to me?”
'18': >-
  “He who, learning that I had been stolen, would have reported it to
  Rāghava—the king of vultures himself—was struck down in battle by Rāvaṇa.”
'19': >-
  “That aged Jaṭāyu, even while standing fast for the slaying of Rāvaṇa,
  accomplished a great deed—by striving to rescue me in that manner.”
'20': >-
  “If Rāghava truly knew that I am here, then today, enraged, he would with his
  arrows make the world free of rākṣasas.”
'21': >-
  “He would burn the city of Laṅkā; he would burn even the great ocean; and he
  would destroy the fame and even the name of low-born Rāvaṇa.”
'22': >-
  “Then, in every house of those rākṣasīs whose lords have been slain, they will
  surely cry again and again—even as I am crying now—there is no doubt.”
'23': >-
  “Rāma with Lakṣmaṇa would seek out Laṅkā of the rākṣasas and lay it waste; for
  when those two behold an enemy, he does not live even for a moment.”
'24': >-
  “Its roads choked with the smoke of funeral pyres, adorned with circles of
  vultures, in a short time it would become like a cremation-ground.”
'25': >-
  “In a very short time I shall attain this cherished desire. This departure of
  mine appears dreadful; it will be an utter reversal for you all.”
'26': >-
  “And the inauspicious signs that are seen in Laṅkā—because of them, in a very
  short time she will be bereft of splendor.”
'27': >-
  “Surely, when that sinful Rāvaṇa, lord of rākṣasas, is slain, unconquerable
  Laṅkā will wither away, like a woman become a widow.”
'28': >-
  “Rich with holy festivals and rejoicings, yet bereft of her lord, with her
  rākṣasas—Laṅkā will become like a woman whose husband is lost.”
'29': >-
  “Surely, ere long, I shall hear in house after house the sound of the
  lamentation of rākṣasa maidens, crying in the anguish of sorrow.”
'30': >-
  “Covered in darkness, her lights extinguished, her foremost rākṣasa champions
  slain—Laṅkā will become a city burned by Rāma’s shafts.”
'31': >-
  “If only that hero Rāma, with eyes reddened at the corners in wrath, knew that
  I am present here, in the dwelling of a rākṣasa!”
'32': >-
  “For me, by this merciless and vile Rāvaṇa, the time that was appointed has
  been declared—and now that time has arrived.”
'33': >-
  “And the death ordained for me proceeds because of this wicked one—these
  Niśācaras, evil-doers, do not know what is right conduct.”
'34': >-
  “Indeed, at this very moment, because of unrighteousness there will arise a
  great portent; these flesh-eating rākṣasas do not understand dharma.”
'35': >-
  “Surely the rākṣasa will prepare me at dawn for his meal; and how shall I
  endure that, without him whose sight is dear to me?”
'36': >-
  “Not beholding Rāma of blood-reddened eyes, sunk in deepest sorrow, I would
  swiftly behold Vaivasvata, the god of Death—without my lord.”
'37': >-
  “Rāma, the elder brother of Bharata, does not know that I am alive; but if he
  and Lakṣmaṇa did know, they would not remain on earth without searching for
  me.”
'38': >-
  “Surely, because of my sorrow alone, that hero—the elder brother of
  Lakṣmaṇa—has gone from here to the world of the gods, abandoning his body upon
  the earth.”
'39': >-
  “Blessed are the gods, together with the Gandharvas, the Siddhas, and the
  supreme seers, who behold that hero Rāma, lotus-eyed.”
'40': >-
  “Or else, what need has that wise one—whose aims are dharma and kāma—of me,
  the wife of Rāma, the royal sage, the supreme-souled one?”
'41': >-
  “When one is seen, affection may arise; friendship cannot exist with one
  unseen. The ungrateful destroy (their bonds), but Rāma will not destroy
  (his).”
'42': >-
  “Or are there some faults in me? Or has my good fortune indeed come to
  ruin—since I, Sītā, the fair lady, am bereft of Rāma, worthy of the highest
  choice?”
'43': >-
  “Better for me than living is death, since I am without that great-souled Rāma
  of unblemished conduct, the heroic destroyer of foes.”
'44': >-
  “Or perhaps those two best of men, the brothers, having laid aside their
  weapons, eating roots and fruits in the forest, are roaming as dwellers of the
  woods.”
'45': >-
  “Or perhaps those two heroic brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, have been slain by
  the rākṣasa king, wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, by means of deceit.”
'46': >-
  “At such a time as this, I desire to die in every way; yet the death appointed
  for me does not overtake me in this exceeding sorrow.”
'47': >-
  “Blessed indeed are the great-souled sages, approved by truth,
  self-controlled, most fortunate—those for whom there exist neither the dear
  nor the undear.”
'48': >-
  “From what is dear, sorrow would arise; from what is not dear, it would arise
  all the more. Having separated themselves from both, salutations to those
  great-souled ones.”
'49': >-
  “I, abandoned by my beloved Rāma of known and steadfast nature, having come
  under the power of sinful Rāvaṇa, shall give up my vital breaths.”
'50': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-sixth canto, called “The Resolution to Give Up Life,” in
  Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the primal epic.
