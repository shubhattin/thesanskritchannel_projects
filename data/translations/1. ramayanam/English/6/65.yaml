'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-fifth canto, named “The Arming of Kumbhakarṇa.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed, Kumbhakarṇa—rebuking Mahodara—then spoke to his brother
  Rāvaṇa, the foremost of the Rākṣasas:
'2': >-
  “I shall this very day wipe away that terrible fear of yours—arising from the
  slaying wrought by that wicked-souled Rāma. Be without enmity; become at ease
  and happy.”
'3': >-
  “The roaring of heroes is not vain—like rain-clouds that thunder without
  water. Behold how roaring in battle is made good by deeds upon the field.”
'4': >-
  “For heroes do not brook mere self-display by words alone; without first
  showing their might, they accomplish deeds that are hard to perform.”
'5': >-
  “It is the speech of you men—faint-hearted and witless—kings who imagine
  yourselves wise, that ever pleases you, O Mahodara, when it is being spoken.”
'6': >-
  “By such as you—cowards in battle, ever speaking what is pleasing, and merely
  following the king—every task has been brought to ruin.”
'7': >-
  “Laṅkā has been reduced to a mere remnant of a kingdom; the treasury is
  depleted; the army has been slain—after coming to this king as though a
  friend, while in truth an enemy in the guise of a friend.”
'8': >-
  “Now I shall go forth to battle, intent on the destruction of the foe. This
  day, in the great war, I shall set right your evil policy.”
'9': >-
  When the wise Kumbhakarṇa had spoken thus, the lord of the Rākṣasas, smiling,
  replied to him in words:
'10': >-
  “This Mahodara is indeed frightened of Rāma—of that there is no doubt.
  Therefore, dear one, he does not relish battle, though he is versed in
  warfare.”
'11': >-
  “None is equal to you in affection and in strength. Go you, Kumbhakarṇa, for
  the slaying of the enemy and for victory.”
'12': >-
  “You were awakened by me while lying down, for the destruction of the foe.
  This indeed is a very great moment for the Rākṣasas, O subduer of enemies.”
'13': >-
  “Go forth taking up your spear, like Yama the Ender holding his noose in hand.
  Devour the Vānara hosts and the two princes, blazing like the sun.”
'14': >-
  “Seeing your form, the Vānara warriors will flee; and the hearts of Rāma and
  Lakṣmaṇa too will be rent asunder.”
'15': >-
  Having spoken thus to mighty Kumbhakarṇa, that Rākṣasa bull—Rāvaṇa—deemed
  himself as one born anew.
'16': >-
  The king, knowing Kumbhakarṇa’s strength and understanding his prowess, became
  glad—pure and radiant like the spotless moon.
'17': >-
  Thus addressed, the mighty one, delighted, went forth; and having heard the
  king’s command, he then set himself to fight.
'18': >-
  Swiftly did that destroyer of enemies take up a sharp spear—entirely of black
  iron, blazing, adorned with ornaments of heated gold.
'19': >-
  It was like Indra’s thunderbolt in splendor, weighty like the vajra
  itself—capable of slaying gods, Dānavas, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, and Nāgas.
'20': >-
  Bearing a huge red garland and great wreath, and emitting fire of itself, he
  took up that vast spear, reddened with the blood of foes.
'21': >-
  The mighty and radiant Kumbhakarṇa spoke these words to Rāvaṇa: “I shall go
  alone; let my forces remain here.”
'22': >-
  “Today, hungry and wrathful, I shall devour those Vānara warriors.” Hearing
  Kumbhakarṇa’s words, Rāvaṇa replied:
'23': >-
  “Go surrounded by troops bearing spears and maces. For the Vānara heroes are
  great-souled, valiant, and resolute in action.”
'24': >-
  “They would bring a solitary man—or one who is heedless—to destruction with
  their teeth. Therefore, most hard to assail, go encircled by troops;
  accomplish everything beneficial to the Rākṣasas, and slaughter the enemy
  host.”
'25': >-
  Then, rising from his seat, the glorious Rāvaṇa bound upon Kumbhakarṇa a
  garland set within with gems.
'26': >-
  He fastened upon that great one fine armlets, finger-rings, excellent
  ornaments, and a necklace white as the moon.
'27': >-
  And Rāvaṇa set upon his limbs divine and fragrant garlands and chaplets, and
  upon his ears earrings as well.
'28': >-
  Adorned with golden armlets, bracelets, and golden ornaments, Kumbhakarṇa of
  large ears shone like a well-fed sacrificial fire.
'29': >-
  With a great dark girdle about his hips he gleamed—like Mount Mandara bound by
  the serpent at the churning of the nectar.
'30': >-
  As golden mail—bearing weight, wind-proof, lightning-bright, blazing with its
  own radiance—was being fastened on him, he shone like the king of mountains
  clothed in twilight clouds.
'31': >-
  That Rākṣasa, adorned in every limb with every ornament, spear in hand,
  appeared like Nārāyaṇa—his fervor roused as when Trivikrama strode forth.
'32': >-
  Embracing his brother and also circling him in reverence, he bowed with his
  head to him and set out, that mighty one.
'33': >-
  Rāvaṇa sent him forth with auspicious and laudatory blessings, with the blare
  of conches and kettledrums, and with troops bearing excellent weapons.
'34': >-
  Elephants and horses and chariots resounding like thunderclouds followed him;
  great warriors, chariot-fighters, accompanied the best of chariot-fighters.
'35': >-
  And with serpents, camels, and asses, and with lions, elephants, beasts, and
  birds, they followed that dreadful, mighty Kumbhakarṇa.
'36': >-
  Sprinkled with showers of flowers, holding a parasol aloft, sharp spear in
  hand—intoxicated with pride and maddened by the scent of blood—he strode out,
  the enemy of the gods and Dānavas.
'37': >-
  And many foot-soldiers, loud-voiced and very strong, followed—terrible
  Rākṣasas, fearsome, grim-eyed, weapons in hand.
'38': >-
  Red-eyed, with broad arms, like heaps of dark-blue collyrium, brandishing
  spears, swords, and sharp axes—
'39': >-
  as well as bhindipālas, iron bars, clubs and maces, and great tree-trunks,
  huge missile-weapons, hard to withstand—
'40': >-
  then, taking on yet another terrible body of dreadful appearance, the greatly
  radiant, mighty Kumbhakarṇa sprang forth.
'41': >-
  With a girth like a hundred bows and a height of six hundred, fierce, with
  eyes like cartwheels, resembling a great mountain—
'42': >-
  gathering the Rākṣasas around him, huge like a burnt mountain, Kumbhakarṇa of
  vast mouth laughed and spoke these words:
'43': >-
  “Today, in my wrath, I shall burn up, portion by portion, those troops of the
  foremost Vānara warriors—like fire consuming moths.”
'44': >-
  “The Vānaras that roam the woods have not, in truth, wronged me as I desire;
  such is the kind of birth of those like us—an ornament to the fore-gardens.”
'45': >-
  “But the root of the besieging of the city is Rāghava together with Lakṣmaṇa.
  When he is slain, all is slain. Him will I kill in battle.”
'46': >-
  As Kumbhakarṇa spoke thus, the Rākṣasas raised a most dreadful roar, as though
  they would shake the very ocean.
'47': >-
  As that wise Kumbhakarṇa rushed forth swiftly, terrible omens arose on every
  side.
'48': >-
  Clouds with meteors and lightning appeared, tawny as asses; and the earth,
  with its oceans and forests, quaked.
'49': >-
  Dreadful jackals howled, their mouths holding blazing morsels; birds formed
  circles that turned to the left (inauspiciously).
'50': >-
  A vulture swooped down upon the spear of him as he went on the way; his left
  eye throbbed, and his left arm trembled.
'51': >-
  Then a blazing meteor fell, with a fearful sound; the sun became lusterless,
  and the wind did not blow pleasantly.
'52': >-
  Not pondering those great, hair-raising portents that had arisen, Kumbhakarṇa
  went forth, driven on by the force of Fate.
'53': >-
  Leaping over the rampart with his feet, mountain-like, he beheld the wondrous
  Vānara army, like a dense mass of clouds.
'54': >-
  Seeing that foremost of Rākṣasas, like a mountain, the Vānaras then fled in
  all directions, like clouds driven apart by the wind.
'55': >-
  Beholding that exceedingly fierce Vānara host scattering to the quarters like
  a broken net of clouds, Kumbhakarṇa—cloud-hued—roared again in delight, like a
  thundercloud.
'56': >-
  Hearing his dreadful roar, like the rumbling of clouds in the sky, many
  monkeys fell upon the ground like śāla trees uprooted and cut down.
'57': >-
  Bearing a huge iron mace, that great-souled Kumbhakarṇa came forth for the
  destruction of foes, striking terrible fear into the troop of monkeys—like a
  lord at the end of an age, holding a rod of punishment over his servants.
'58': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fifth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, named “The Arming of Kumbhakarṇa.”
