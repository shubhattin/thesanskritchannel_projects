  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, is
  the nineteenth sarga, called “Tārā’s Coming (to the battlefield).”
'1': >-
  That great king of the vānaras, lying down and tormented by the arrows, though
  answered with reasoned and meaningful words, made no further reply.
'2': >-
  His limbs were torn and battered by rocks, and he had been struck hard by
  trees; and being overpowered by Rāma’s arrow, at the very end of life he
  swooned into delusion.
'3': >-
  Tārā heard that Vālin—the tiger among the monkeys—had been slain in the battle
  by the discharge of an arrow, given and let fly by Rāma.
'4': >-
  Hearing the exceedingly dreadful slaying of her husband—dear as life to
  her—she, agitated, sprang forth in great haste from that mountain-cave.
'5': >-
  But those mighty vānaras who were attendants of Aṅgada—seeing Rāma with bow in
  hand—were frightened and ran away.
'6': >-
  Then she saw those terrified monkeys fleeing swiftly, scattered away from
  their troop, like deer fallen away from the herd when the leader of the herd
  has been slain.
'7': >-
  Approaching them, she herself being sorrowful, spoke to them—all of them
  frightened by Rāma, as if they were being pursued by arrows.
'8': >-
  “You vānaras are the foremost followers of the lion among kings. Abandoning
  him, why do you run thus, greatly terrified, as though fallen into calamity?”
'9': >-
  “If, for the sake of sovereignty, that brother has been struck down by a cruel
  brother—by Rāma’s far-sent arrows that strike from afar—”
'10': >-
  Hearing the words of the wife of the monkey-king, the monkeys—able to assume
  forms at will—spoke to that lady words fitting to the time, without
  hesitation.
'11': >-
  “O you whose son yet lives—turn back; protect your son Aṅgada. Death,
  appearing in the form of Rāma, has slain Vālin and is bearing him away.”
'12': >-
  “Having hurled trees and likewise vast rocks, Vālin has been felled by arrows
  like thunderbolts—just as if struck down by the thunderbolt itself.”
'13': >-
  “All this monkey-force has been overpowered and has fled, now that this tiger
  among the monkeys—radiant like Śakra (Indra)—has been slain.”
'14': >-
  “Let the city be guarded by heroes, and let Aṅgada be anointed. The monkeys
  will follow the son of Vālin who stands in his father’s place.”
'15': >-
  “Or else, O fair-faced one, enter at once some secure and suitable place here;
  indeed, today itself the monkeys are entering the fortresses quickly.”
'16': >-
  “Here are forest-dwellers, some without wives and some with wives; from those
  greedy ones—deceived and then deceiving in turn—there is very great fear for
  us.”
'17': >-
  Hearing the words of those who had come within a short distance, the lady of
  lovely smile answered with words true to her own nature.
'18': >-
  “What have I to do with a son? What even with a kingdom? What with my own
  life, when that fortunate lion among monkeys—my husband—has perished?”
'19': >-
  “I shall go to the very feet of that great-souled one, who has been cast down
  by the arrow discharged by Rāma.”
'20': >-
  Having spoken thus, she ran forth, weeping and fainting with grief, striking
  her head and breast and arms in anguish.
'21': >-
  As she went, she then saw her husband fallen upon the ground—he who was the
  slayer of lords of Dānavas and who never turned back in battles.
'22': >-
  She saw him—like Vāsava (Indra)—a thrower down of the best of mountains, like
  thunderbolts; like a great wind arrested; like the rumbling of a vast mass of
  clouds.
'23': >-
  Equal to Śakra in prowess, like a cloud that has poured rain and then ceased;
  terrible among those who roar, a hero felled by a hero—like a lordly lion
  struck down by a tiger for the sake of flesh.
'24': >-
  Like a sacred shrine revered by all the world, with banner and altar, that has
  been torn up and destroyed by Suparṇa (Garuḍa) for the sake of a serpent.
'25': >-
  She also saw Rāma, mighty with the power of his bow, standing there firm in
  support; and she saw Rāma’s younger brother, and likewise the younger brother
  of her husband.
'26': >-
  Passing beyond them, she reached her husband slain in battle; and, looking
  upon him, distressed and bewildered, she fell upon the ground.
'27': >-
  Then, rising again as though from sleep and crying, “Ārya-putra!” she wept on
  seeing her husband, as though wrapped about with the nooses of Death.
'28': >-
  Seeing her wailing like a kurarī-bird, Sugrīva fell into grievous
  dejection—especially on seeing Aṅgada arrive.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the nineteenth sarga, called “Tārā’s Coming,” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa
  of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic.
