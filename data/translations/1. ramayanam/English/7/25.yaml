  Now begins the twenty-fifth canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Preventing the Slaying of Madhu.”
'1': >-
  Having thus bestowed that terrible forest upon his own sister’s lord,
  Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa) consoled his sister; and, being delighted, he became the
  more composed and at ease.
'2': >-
  Thereafter the mighty lord of rākṣasas entered, along with his followers, the
  excellent pleasure-grove of Laṅkā known by the name Nikumbhilā.
'3': >-
  Then he beheld a sacrifice set forth and standing ready—thickly furnished with
  hundreds of sacrificial posts and made beautiful by an auspicious
  shrine—shining as though ablaze with splendor.
'4': >-
  There he saw his own son, Meghānāda, formidable to behold, clad in a black
  antelope-skin, bearing a water-pot, and marked by the crest and banner
  befitting one engaged in sacred rites.
'5': >-
  Approaching him, the lord of Laṅkā embraced him with his arms and said: “What
  is this, my child, that you are engaged in? Tell me the truth in full.”
'6': >-
  Then the great ascetic, the best of twice-born, Uśanā (Śukra), spoke there to
  Rāvaṇa, foremost among rākṣasas, for the sake of the prosperous success of the
  sacrifice.
'7': >-
  “O king, I shall declare it to you—hear all of it. By your son, seven
  sacrifices have been undertaken, extensive in their many rites and
  arrangements.
'8': >-
  The Agniṣṭoma, the Aśvamedha, a sacrifice abounding in much gold, the Rājasūya
  sacrifice, the Gomeda, and likewise the Vaiṣṇava sacrifice.
'9': >-
  And when the Māheśvara sacrifice—rare indeed for men to accomplish—was set in
  motion, your son obtained boons here directly from Paśupati (Śiva) himself.
'10': >-
  A divine chariot, moving at will, traversing the mid-air, steadfast and
  unfailing; and also a darkness-named, tāmasī māyā, by which darkness comes to
  be produced.
'11': >-
  “By that māyā, O lord of rākṣasas, when employed in battle, his course cannot
  be discerned—neither by gods nor by asuras.”
'12': >-
  “An inexhaustible pair of quivers, a bow exceedingly hard to overcome, and
  also a mighty weapon, O king, that destroys enemies in battle.”
'13': >-
  “Having obtained all these boons, O Daśānana, this your son stands here today
  at the completion of the sacrifice, desirous of seeing you.”
'14': >-
  Then Daśagrīva said: “This deed is not commendable, inasmuch as the
  enemies—Indra and those before him—have been honored with sacrificial
  offerings and wealth.”
'15': >-
  “Come now; know this to have been well done—there is no doubt. Come, gentle
  one; let us go back to our own dwelling.”
'16': >-
  Then Daśagrīva went forth, together with his son and with Vibhīṣaṇa, and
  caused all those women to be brought down, all of them choking with sobs and
  tears.
'17': >-
  They were women of auspicious marks, jewel-like in worth, belonging to gods,
  dānavas, and rākṣasas. Knowing his intention regarding them, righteous-souled
  Vibhīṣaṇa spoke these words:
'18': >-
  “By such deeds—ruinous to fame and to lineage—you, knowing the outrage done to
  kinsfolk, act according to your own perverse counsel.
'19': >-
  “Having violated those kinsmen, you have brought these excellent women. But
  disregarding you, O king, Kumbhīnasī has been carried off by Madhu!”
'20': >-
  Rāvaṇa replied: “I do not understand what this is. Who is this of whom you
  speak, named ‘Madhu’?”
'21': >-
  Then Vibhīṣaṇa, enraged, spoke to his brother: “Let the consequence of this
  sinner’s deed, now come to fruition, be heard.
'22': >-
  “The elder brother of our maternal grandsire—also the elder brother of
  Sumālin—was the aged and wise night-wanderer renowned as Mālyavān.
'23': >-
  “He was the eldest father of our mother—indeed, our maternal grand-uncle. Of
  his was a granddaughter named Kumbhīnasī.
'24': >-
  “She is our maternal aunt, a maiden born of fire; and by right of fraternal
  duty she is indeed the lawful sister of us brothers.
'25': >-
  “She was carried off, O king, by Madhu, a mighty rākṣasa—at a time when your
  son was engaged in sacrifice, and I was dwelling within the waters.”
'26': >-
  “And while Kumbhakarṇa, O great king, was experiencing sleep, Madhu slew the
  foremost rākṣasas—ministers esteemed here as your trusted ones—
'27': >-
  “and, after violating her, carried her away, even though she had been sleeping
  within your inner palace. Though you heard of it, O great king, he was not
  slain—he was simply endured.”
'28': >-
  “Since a maiden must necessarily be given by her brothers to a husband, this
  indeed is the fruit of that evil deed of his—of a wicked-minded man.”
'29': >-
  “It has thus come about in this very world; let it be known to you.” Hearing
  Vibhīṣaṇa’s words, that rākṣasa-lord Rāvaṇa, shaken by the depravity within
  himself, seethed like an ocean of heated waters.
'30': >-
  Then Daśagrīva spoke, wrathful, his eyes reddened with anger: “Let my chariot
  be made ready at once! Let our warriors make themselves prepared!”
'31': >-
  “Let my brother Kumbhakarṇa, and those who are the chief night-wanderers,
  mount their vehicles, bearing weapons and missiles of many kinds.”
'32': >-
  “Today, having slain that Madhu in battle, without fear of Rāvaṇa, I shall go
  to the world of the gods, eager for combat and surrounded by my friends!”
'33': >-
  Then four foremost thousands of akṣauhiṇīs of rākṣasas, furnished quickly with
  weapons of many kinds, marched out, desirous of battle.
'34': >-
  Indrajit went in front, taking up soldiers from the army; Rāvaṇa went in the
  middle; and Kumbhakarṇa went behind.
'35': >-
  And righteous-souled Vibhīṣaṇa remained in Laṅkā, practicing what is
  righteous. All the rest, illustrious ones, went forth toward Madhu’s city.
'36': >-
  Upon asses, camels, blazing horses, porpoises, and huge serpents, all the
  rākṣasas advanced, filling the sky without a break.
'37': >-
  And hundreds of daityas also, who had enmity with the gods, seeing Rāvaṇa
  going, followed indeed behind him.
'38': >-
  Then Daśānana, having gone to and entered Madhu’s city, did not see Madhu
  there; but there he saw his sister.
'39': And she, bowing low with joined palms, went to his feet with her head.
'40': >-
  Kumbhīnasī, terrified then before that king of rākṣasas—he raised her up,
  saying, “You need not fear.”
'41': >-
  Rāvaṇa, the foremost of rākṣasas, said: “What can I do for you?” She replied:
  “If you are gracious to me, O king, mighty-armed and giver of honor, you ought
  not today to slay my husband here.”
'42': >-
  “No fear like this is spoken of for women of noble family here; of all fears,
  widowhood is the greatest calamity.”
'43': >-
  “Be true to your word, O lord of kings; look upon me who am supplicating. You
  yourself have said, O great king, ‘You need not fear.’”
'44': >-
  Rāvaṇa, delighted, said to his sister standing there: “And where is that
  husband of yours? Let him be reported to me at once.”
'45': >-
  “Together with him I shall go, bringing victory, to the world of the gods. Out
  of compassion and affection for you, I desist from slaying Madhu.”
'46': >-
  Thus addressed, she raised up that sleeping night-wanderer and, as though
  overjoyed, that rākṣasī spoke to her husband:
'47': >-
  “Daśagrīva has arrived—my brother of great strength—desiring conquest of the
  world of the gods; and he chooses you also for his aid.”
'48': >-
  “Therefore, for his assistance, go with your kinsmen, O rākṣasa. For one who
  is affectionate and seeks alliance, it is fitting to render what is required
  for his purpose.”
'49': Hearing her words, Madhu replied, “So be it,” and spoke thus.
'50': >-
  Then, approaching in due and proper manner, he beheld the foremost of rākṣasas
  and honored Rāvaṇa, lord of rākṣasas, in accordance with righteousness.
'51': >-
  Having received that honor, Daśagrīva, mighty in valor, stayed one night in
  Madhu’s mansion; and then he set about preparing to depart.
'52': >-
  Thereafter, coming to Kailāsa—the mountain that is the abode of Vaiśravaṇa
  (Kubera)—the rākṣasa-lord, radiant like Mahendra (Indra), encamped his army.
'53': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fifth canto of the Uttara-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the first epic, entitled “Preventing the Slaying
  of Madhu.”
