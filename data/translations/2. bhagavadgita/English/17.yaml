'0': Om—salutations unto the Supreme Self (Paramātmā).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': 'Now, the Seventeenth Chapter: The Yoga of the Division of the Threefold Faith.'
'3': 'Arjuna said:'
'4': >-
  Those who, setting aside the ordinances of the scriptures, worship with
  faith—what is their steadfastness, O Kṛṣṇa? Is it of sattva, or of rajas, or
  of tamas?
'5': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'6': >-
  Threefold indeed is the faith of embodied beings; it is born of their own
  nature—sāttvic, rājasik, and tāmasik. Hear of it.
'7': >-
  The faith of each is in accordance with his own sattva (inner disposition), O
  Bhārata. This person is made up of faith; whatever one’s faith is, that verily
  is he.
'8': >-
  Sāttvic people worship the devas; the rājasik worship yakṣas and rākṣasas;
  others—tāmasik people—worship the departed spirits (preta) and hosts of beings
  (bhūta-gaṇas).
'9': >-
  Those people who undertake terrible austerities not enjoined by the
  scriptures, endowed with hypocrisy and egoism, and possessed of desire,
  attachment, and forceful will,
'10': >-
  torment, senselessly, the multitude of elements within the body, and Me also
  who dwell within the body—know them to be of āsuric resolve.
'11': >-
  Food also, which is dear to everyone, is of three kinds; likewise sacrifice,
  austerity, and charity. Hear from Me this distinction among them.
'12': >-
  Foods that increase life, purity, strength, health, happiness, and
  satisfaction; that are juicy, unctuous, substantial, and pleasing to the
  heart—such foods are dear to the sāttvic.
'13': >-
  Foods that are bitter, sour, salty, excessively hot, pungent, dry, and
  burning—such foods are liked by the rājasik, and they produce pain, sorrow,
  and disease.
'14': >-
  Food that is stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten, and left overnight, as well as
  remnants (leavings) and what is impure—such is the food dear to the tāmasik.
'15': >-
  That sacrifice which is offered according to injunction, by those who desire
  no fruit, with the mind firmly set on the thought, ‘It is to be done’—that is
  sāttvic.
'16': >-
  But that sacrifice which is offered with an eye on the result, and also for
  the sake of display, O best of the Bharatas—know that sacrifice to be rājasik.
'17': >-
  A sacrifice that is devoid of rule, without distribution of food, without
  mantra, without gift to the priests, and devoid of faith—such sacrifice is
  declared to be tāmasik.
'18': >-
  Worship of the devas, of the twice-born, of the teacher, and of the wise;
  purity, straightforwardness, celibacy, and non-violence—this is said to be
  bodily austerity.
'19': >-
  Speech that causes no agitation, that is truthful, pleasant, and beneficial;
  and also the practice of sacred study (svādhyāya)—this is called austerity of
  speech.
'20': >-
  Serenity of mind, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, and purity of
  intention—this is called mental austerity.
'21': >-
  This threefold austerity, practiced with supreme faith by people who are
  steadfast, desiring no fruit—this is said to be sāttvic.
'22': >-
  That austerity which is practiced for the sake of gaining honor, respect, and
  worship, and also with hypocrisy—this is declared here to be rājasik, unsteady
  and impermanent.
'23': >-
  That austerity which is practiced out of foolish obstinacy, with self-torment,
  or for the purpose of harming another—this is said to be tāmasik.
'24': >-
  That charity which is given from the sense of duty—‘It ought to be given’—to
  one who does nothing in return, at the proper place and time, and to a worthy
  recipient—that charity is held to be sāttvic.
'25': >-
  But that charity which is given with a view to receiving something in return,
  or again with an eye on its fruit, and is given reluctantly or with
  distress—that charity is remembered as rājasik.
'26': >-
  That charity which is given at an improper place and time, and to unworthy
  recipients; which is given without respect or with contempt—that is declared
  to be tāmasik.
'27': >-
  ‘Om Tat Sat’—this threefold designation of Brahman is remembered. By that were
  ordained of old the Brāhmaṇas, the Vedas, and the sacrifices.
'28': >-
  Therefore, uttering ‘Om,’ the acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity, as
  enjoined by ordinance, are ever undertaken by the expounders of Brahman.
'29': >-
  Uttering ‘Tat,’ without aiming at the fruit, the acts of sacrifice and
  austerity, and the various acts of charity, are performed by seekers of
  liberation.
'30': >-
  In the sense of reality (being) and in the sense of goodness (worthiness), the
  word ‘Sat’ is used; and likewise, O Pārtha, the word ‘Sat’ is applied to an
  auspicious act.
'31': >-
  Steadfastness in sacrifice, in austerity, and in charity is also called ‘Sat’;
  and action undertaken for that sake is indeed termed ‘Sat’.
'32': >-
  Whatever is offered, given, or austerity performed, and whatever is done
  without faith—O Pārtha, it is called ‘Asat’; it is of no value either here or
  hereafter.
'33': >-
  ‘Om Tat Sat’—thus, in the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, among the Upaniṣads, in the
  Brahma-vidyā (knowledge of Brahman), in the Yoga-śāstra, in the dialogue
  between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, ends the Seventeenth Chapter entitled ‘The Yoga
  of the Division of the Threefold Faith.’
