  Now begins the ninety-fourth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Bewilderment Caused by the Gāndharva Missile.”
'1': >-
  Entering the assembly-hall, the king (Rāvaṇa) — dejected and afflicted with
  the deepest sorrow — sat down upon the chief seat, breathing hard like a lion
  enraged.
'2': >-
  Then that mighty Rāvaṇa, foremost in strength, his palms joined in reverence,
  spoke to all those leaders of the forces, for he was wasted by the grief of
  his son’s calamity.
'3': >-
  “Let all of you, completely equipped with elephants and horses, march out —
  adorned with troops of chariots and with foot-soldiers as well.”
'4': >-
  “Surrounding Rāma alone in the battle, you ought to slay him, pouring forth
  showers of arrows like clouds in the rainy season.”
'5': >-
  “Then, tomorrow, in the great conflict, when his limbs have been pierced and
  broken by your sharp arrows, I myself shall kill Rāma, in the sight of the
  world.”
'6': >-
  Receiving these words of the lord of the rākṣasas, the rākṣasas swiftly
  marched out in their fast chariots, arrayed in many divisions.
'7': >-
  All of them hurled at the vānaras iron clubs, barbed javelins, arrows, swords,
  and axes — every kind of weapon that brings bodily destruction.
'8': >-
  And the vānaras, in turn, hurled trees and rocks at the rākṣasas. Thus did a
  most terrible battle arise as the sun approached its rising.
'9': >-
  A tumultuous conflict came to pass between rākṣasas and vānaras. They struck
  with wondrous maces, with spears, swords, and axes.
'10': >-
  Then in battle the vānaras and rākṣasas smote one another. As the fight thus
  raged, there arose a vast and extraordinary dust-cloud,
'11': >-
  and it was subdued and laid by the streams of blood from rākṣasas and vānaras.
  Elephants and chariots formed its banks; arrows were like fishes; and fallen
  standards were like trees along it.
'12': >-
  Rivers of blood flowed forth, bearing along heaps of bodies. Then all those
  vānaras, drenched in torrents of blood,
'13': >-
  leaping again and again in the battle, broke and shattered standards, armor,
  chariots, horses, and weapons of many kinds.
'14': >-
  With sharp teeth and claws the plavaṅgamas tore apart the rākṣasas’ hair,
  ears, brows, and noses.
'15': >-
  In the fight, the foremost of vānaras rushed upon each single rākṣasa as
  though a hundred (rushed at once), like birds swooping upon a fruit-laden
  tree.
'16': >-
  Then the rākṣasas, terrible and mountain-like, struck down the dreadful
  vānaras with heavy maces, spears, swords, and axes.
'17': >-
  And the great host of vānaras, being slain by the rākṣasas, sought refuge —
  fleeing for protection to Rāma, the son of Daśaratha, as to their sure
  shelter.
'18': >-
  Thereupon mighty, high-souled Rāma, taking up his bow, entered the rākṣasa
  army and rained down a shower of arrows.
'19': >-
  But just as clouds in the sky cannot overtake the sun, so those exceedingly
  dreadful rākṣasas could not reach Rāma when he had entered their ranks, as he
  consumed them with the fire of his arrows.
'20': >-
  Indeed, the night-rangers beheld in battle the deeds accomplished by Rāma —
  terrible acts, hard for them to endure.
'21': >-
  They saw him shaking the great army, scattering the mighty chariot-warriors;
  yet they did not truly see Rāma himself — as one does not see the wind moving
  within the forest.
'22': >-
  They beheld the host cut down, shattered, burned, broken, and tormented by
  weapons, by Rāma — but they did not see Rāma, swift in action.
'23': >-
  Though he struck their bodies, they did not perceive Rāghava — as subjects do
  not perceive the Supreme Spirit abiding in the objects of the senses.
'24': >-
  “This one slays the elephant-corps; this one slays the great chariot-warriors;
  this one with sharp arrows slays the foot-soldiers along with the horsemen!”
'25': >-
  Thus all those rākṣasas, angered, struck one another in battle, for they saw
  many forms resembling Rāma, because of Rāghava’s likenesses (created by
  illusion).
'26': >-
  They did not behold Rāma, even as he burned their army; for they were deluded
  by the supreme Gāndharva missile of that great-souled one.
'27': >-
  In the battle the rākṣasas saw a thousand Rāmas; then again, in that great
  fight, they saw the son of Kakutstha as but one alone.
'28': >-
  They beheld the golden tip of that great-souled one’s bow whirling about like
  a circling firebrand, yet they did not discern Rāghava himself.
'29': >-
  They saw that “Rāma-wheel”: his body as the hub; his valor as its flame; the
  circle of arrows as its rim; the bow as its felly; the thunder of the
  bowstring as the rumbling of its surface; its brilliance born of his splendor,
  intelligence, and excellence.
'30': >-
  That wheel — bounded by the virtues of divine missiles, striking down rākṣasas
  in battle — the people (beholders) saw as Rāma’s wheel, like the wheel of Time
  itself.
'31': Ten thousand chariots, swift as the wind,
'32': >-
  eighteen thousand powerful elephants; fourteen thousand horses with their
  riders; and two full hundreds of thousands of rākṣasa foot-soldiers —
'33': >-
  all these, within one-eighth part of a day, were slain by Rāma alone with
  arrows like tongues of fire, (though those rākṣasas were) able to assume forms
  at will.
'34': >-
  Bereft of horses, bereft of chariots, their standards stilled and shattered,
  the night-rangers — only a remnant left alive — fled back toward the city of
  Laṅkā.
'35': >-
  With elephants, foot-soldiers, and horses slain, that battlefield became like
  the play-ground of mighty Rudra when he is wrathful.
'36': >-
  Then the gods with the gandharvas, the siddhas, and the supreme seers praised
  Rāma’s deed, exclaiming, “Well done! Well done!”
'37': >-
  Thereupon righteous-souled Rāma spoke immediately to Sugrīva, and to
  Vibhīṣaṇa, and to Hanūmān the vānarā,
'38': >-
  and to Jāmbavān, best of the monkeys, and also to Mainda and Dvivida: “This
  divine power of the missile is either mine, or it belongs to Tryambaka
  (Śiva).”
'39': >-
  Having slain that army of the rākṣasa king, the great-souled Rāma, equal to
  Śakra (Indra), and untired in missiles and weapons, was then extolled by the
  delighted hosts of the gods.
'40': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-fourth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Bewilderment Caused by the
  Gāndharva Missile.”
