  Now begins the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa: the fifty-eighth
  sarga, entitled “The Account of Rāma’s Message.”
'1': >-
  When the king, having somewhat recovered, returned again from his
  bewilderment, he summoned that charioteer, Sumantra, and inquired within
  himself about the true tidings of Rāma.
'2': >-
  Then the charioteer, O great king, approached with palms joined in
  reverence—seeing the king lamenting for Rāma alone, overwhelmed with grief and
  sorrow.
'3': >-
  He beheld the aged monarch exceedingly afflicted—like an elephant newly seized
  by capture—heaving deep sighs, brooding, and unwell, as though a mighty tusker
  in distress.
'4': >-
  And the king, seeing Sumantra standing near with limbs dulled by dust, his
  face filled with tears and his bearing dejected, spoke in extreme anguish:
'5': >-
  “Where indeed will the righteous-souled Rāma dwell, taking refuge at the root
  of some tree? O charioteer, will Rāghava, who is supremely happy by nature, be
  lacking in anything there?”
'6': >-
  “Sumantra, he who is not fit for suffering—accustomed to couches and rest—how
  does the son of the protector of the earth lie upon the bare ground, like one
  without any support?”
'7': >-
  “He whom foot-soldiers, chariots, and elephants used to follow when he went
  forth—how will that Rāma live, having resorted to the lonely forest?”
'8': >-
  “In a forest roamed by birds and beasts, frequented by black serpents—how have
  the two princes, together with Vaidehī, entered and taken to that woodland?”
'9': >-
  “And with gentle, ascetic Sītā—O Sumantra—how did the royal sons go on foot,
  descending from the chariot?”
'10': >-
  “Truly, O charioteer, your purpose has been fulfilled, since you have seen my
  two sons entering the depths of the forest—like the twin Aśvins approaching
  Mount Mandara.”
'11': >-
  “What words did Rāma speak? What did Lakṣmaṇa speak? And when you reached the
  forest, what did Maithilī speak?”
'12': >-
  “Tell me, O charioteer, of Rāma—how he sat, how he lay down, and what he ate.
  By hearing this I shall live on, even as Yayāti lived upon the virtue of the
  righteous.”
'13': >-
  Thus urged by the lord of men, Sumantra, his voice faltering, spoke to the
  king with speech choked by tears.
'14': >-
  “Rāghava said to me, O great king—upholding dharma alone—having made añjali
  and bowed his head in reverence:
'15': >-
  “‘The king is advanced in years; do not obstruct him. Live within the prince’s
  rule, carrying out his commands and administration.’”
'16': >-
  “And again he spoke to me further, shedding copious tears: ‘As a mother, your
  mother (Kauśalyā) is to be seen by you—she who longs for her son.’”
'17': >-
  Thus, O great king, while speaking to me in this manner, the highly
  illustrious Rāma, lotus-eyed with reddish-brown pupils, shed tears profusely.
'18': >-
  But Lakṣmaṇa, greatly enraged, breathing hard, spoke these words: ‘By what
  offence has this prince been banished?’
'19': >-
  ‘Indeed, by the king—taking shelter in the light command of Kaikeyī—has an act
  been done, be it right or wrong, by which we are oppressed.’
'20': >-
  ‘If Rāma has been exiled, whether brought about for the sake of greed, or for
  the sake of granting a boon—by every reckoning an evil deed has been done.’
'21': >-
  ‘This, at least, has been done at the behest of the sovereign’s will, as he
  desired; but in the abandoning of Rāma, I perceive no valid cause at all.’
'22': >-
  ‘Undertaken without due consideration, and contrary (to right), through the
  lightness and rashness of judgment—this banishment of Rāghava will bring about
  a great outcry.’
'23': >-
  ‘As for me, O great king, I do not recognize “fatherhood” here: Rāghava is my
  brother, my master, my kinsman, and my father as well.’
'24': >-
  ‘Having abandoned one beloved by all the worlds, devoted to the welfare of all
  the worlds—how will all people ever be devoted to you after this deed?’
'25': >-
  ‘Having banished righteous Rāma, who delights all subjects—how will you, as
  king, stand opposed to all the worlds?’
'26': >-
  But Jānakī, O great king, sighing like an ascetic woman, stood as though her
  mind were struck down by calamity—motionless, dazed, and overwhelmed.
'27': >-
  The illustrious princess, who had never before seen such misfortune, weeping
  in that sorrow, spoke nothing at all to me.
'28': >-
  Looking toward her husband, her face drying up (with distress), she suddenly
  released tears, beholding me as I departed.
'29': >-
  And in the same manner Rāma stood, his face wet with tears, hands joined in
  reverence, remaining under the support of Lakṣmaṇa’s arm; and likewise Sītā,
  weeping, the ascetic lady, kept gazing at the royal chariot—and at me as well,
  just so.
'30': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-eighth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the revered
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Account of Rāma’s Message.”
