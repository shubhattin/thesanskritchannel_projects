  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa,
  begins the ninety-ninth sarga, called “The passing away, in due course of
  time, of Kauśalyā and the others.”
'1': >-
  Now, when the night had dawned into morning, Rāma, having caused the great
  sages to be assembled, said to his two sons—Kuśa and Lava—“Let it be sung,”
  without fear and without hesitation.
'2': >-
  Then, when those great-souled brahmarṣis had taken their seats, those two—Kuśa
  and Lava—sang that poem which tells what is to come hereafter.
'3': >-
  But when Sītā, rich in truth and virtue, had entered the bosom of the earth,
  at the conclusion of that sacrifice, Rāma became exceedingly sorrowful.
'4': >-
  Not seeing Vaidehī, he deemed this whole world to be empty. Overwhelmed by the
  deepest grief, he found no peace within his mind.
'5': >-
  Sending away all the kings, and the bears, monkeys, and rākṣasas as well; and
  dismissing also the multitude of people—beginning with the foremost of
  brāhmaṇas—after first bestowing wealth upon them,
'6': >-
  Thus, having duly completed the sacrifice according to ordinance, that
  Rāghava—then, after dismissing them all—Rāma of lotus-like eyes,
'7': >-
  entered Ayodhyā, bearing Sītā within his heart—he, the lord of men, who had
  performed the desired sacrifice, and was accompanied by his two sons.
'8': >-
  The delighter of the Raghus did not choose another wife in place of Sītā; and
  at each sacrifice, for the purpose of the consort required in the rite, Jānakī
  became a golden image.
'9': >-
  Then he performed Aśvamedha sacrifices for ten thousand years; and Vājapeya
  sacrifices tenfold (in number), and also many sacrifices abounding in gold.
'10': >-
  He worshipped (the gods) with Agniṣṭoma and Atirātra rites, and with great and
  costly Gosava sacrifices, and with other kratus as well—he, the illustrious
  one, giving the due sacrificial fees.
'11': >-
  In this manner, a very long time passed for that great-souled Rāghava,
  established in his kingdom and ever striving in dharma.
'12': >-
  Day after day, the bears, monkeys, and rākṣasas, remaining under Rāma’s शासन
  (rule and governance), delighted their king, Rāghava.
'13': >-
  In season the rain-god rained; there was plentiful food; the quarters were
  clear and pure. The city and the provinces alike were filled with people who
  were joyful and well-nourished.
'14': >-
  None died before his time; among living beings there was no such thing as
  disease. No misfortune whatsoever existed while Rāma ruled the kingdom.
'15': >-
  Then, after a long lapse of time, Rāma’s renowned mother (Kauśalyā),
  surrounded by sons and grandsons, attained the law of time—that is, she passed
  away.
'16': >-
  And Sumitrā and the renowned Kaikeyī followed her as well; having performed
  many kinds of righteous duties, they took their station in heaven.
'17': >-
  All those fortunate queens, rejoicing in heaven together with King Daśaratha,
  were reunited; and they obtained the fruit of all dharma.
'18': >-
  For them, at due times, Rāma bestowed great gifts—without any distinction—upon
  brāhmaṇas and ascetics, in honor of his mothers.
'19': >-
  That righteous-souled Rāma performed paternal rites and unsurpassed
  sacrifices—precious as brahmanic treasures—thereby increasing the welfare of
  his fathers and the gods.
'20': >-
  Thus many thousands of years passed happily, while he ever augmented dharma in
  manifold ways through sacrifices.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-ninth sarga in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, called “The passing away, in due course of time, of
  Kauśalyā and the others.”
