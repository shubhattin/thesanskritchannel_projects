  Now begins the Thirty-first Sarga of the Kishkindha Kanda of the glorious
  Valmiki Ramayana, named “Lakshmana’s Wrath.”
'1': >-
  Lakshmana, the younger son of the lord of men—himself a prince, the younger
  brother of Rama—spoke to that Sugriva, who was given over to desire, who was
  wretched yet of unbroken spirit, overwhelmed by grief and with anger rising
  high, addressing him as his elder.
'2': >-
  “This vanara will not remain established in righteous conduct; he does not
  regard the consequences that follow from one’s deeds. He shall not enjoy the
  prosperity and sovereignty of the vanara kingdom—for his mind does not refrain
  from transgressing what is proper.”
'3': >-
  “Through the loss of discernment he is attached to vulgar pleasures; and,
  relying on your favor, he has conceived no thought of requital. Let the heroic
  Vali see his elder brother slain. A kingdom should not be granted in this
  manner to one so deficient in virtue.”
'4': >-
  “I cannot bear this anger, whose force has surged up. This very day I shall
  slay Sugriva, false as he is. Let the son of Vali, together with the foremost
  of the monkey-warriors, seek out the princess, the daughter of the king.”
'5': >-
  When Rama—the slayer of hostile heroes—saw him springing forth, bow and arrows
  seized, his purpose declared, his wrath fierce for battle, Rama spoke words
  that were in keeping with his own judgment, and were uttered with gentle
  persuasion.
'6': >-
  “Indeed, one like you would not commit such a sin in this world. He who, being
  noble, restrains anger and does not slay—he is the hero, he is the best of
  men.”
'7': >-
  “This is not a matter in which you should act so, O Lakshmana, who follow
  righteous conduct. Maintain that affection, and adhere to what has been
  previously agreed and duly settled.”
'8': >-
  “Avoiding harsh words, and speaking with conciliation in your speech, you
  ought to address Sugriva about what has lapsed as time has passed.”
'9': >-
  Thus instructed in the matter by his elder brother, Lakshmana—the heroic
  slayer of enemy champions, the bull among men—entered the city as was fitting.
'10': >-
  Then Lakshmana, of auspicious resolve and wise, devoted to what was pleasing
  and beneficial to his brother, yet stirred with indignation, went to the
  dwelling of the monkey-king.
'11': >-
  Taking up his bow, resembling Indra’s bow, like the wrath of Death at the end
  of time, vast as a mountain peak—like Mandara with its slopes—
'12': >-
  Lakshmana, who carried out commands as spoken and could also answer with due
  reply, being equal to Brihaspati in intellect, reflected thus at that time—
'13': >-
  Encompassed by the fire of his brother’s anger that had arisen from desire and
  wrath, Lakshmana, displeased, set forth like a tempest-blast.
'14': >-
  With speed he violently felled sala trees, tala trees, and ashvakarna trees;
  hurling down mountain crags and other trees in his impetuous force.
'15': >-
  Shattering rocks with his feet like a swift elephant, leaping far with a
  single stride, he went quickly, driven by the urgency of the task.
'16': >-
  The tiger among the Ikshvakus beheld Kishkindha—the great city of the lord of
  monkeys—crowded with forces, difficult of access, hemmed in by mountain
  defiles.
'17': >-
  With lips quivering in wrath, Lakshmana, intent upon Sugriva, saw terrible
  vanaras moving about outside Kishkindha.
'18': >-
  Seeing Lakshmana, the bull among men, all the vanaras—elephant-like—within
  that mountainous region seized hundreds of mountain peaks and huge trees grown
  tall, to use as weapons.
'19': >-
  But when Lakshmana saw them all with weapons in hand, he became twice as
  enraged—like a fire fed with abundant fuel.
'20': >-
  When those monkey-warriors saw him, shaken with fear, agitated, resembling
  Time, Death, and the dissolution at the end of an age, they fled by hundreds
  in all directions.
'21': >-
  Then the foremost of vanaras entered Sugriva’s house and reported both the
  wrath and the arrival of Lakshmana.
'22': >-
  Sugriva then, lustful and attached, seated with Tara, the bull among monkeys,
  did not at that time heed the words of those lion-like monkeys.
'23': >-
  Then, instructed by the ministers, the vanaras—terrifying to behold,
  resembling mountain elephants and clouds—came forth from the city.
'24': >-
  All were armed with nails and teeth; all were heroes of monstrous appearance;
  all had tiger-like fangs; all were fearsome with gaping countenances.
'25': >-
  Some had the strength of ten elephants; some ten times greater than that; some
  shone with an energy equal to that of a thousand elephants.
'26': >-
  Then Lakshmana, enraged, beheld that Kishkindha—hard to assail—pervaded
  everywhere by those mighty monkeys holding trees in their hands.
'27': >-
  Then all those vanaras of lofty valor, coming forth from within the ramparts
  and moats, stood manifestly in view.
'28': >-
  Seeing Sugriva’s negligence and his own elder brother’s purpose, the heroic
  Lakshmana, overmastered by anger, advanced again.
'29': >-
  Breathing long, hot, and deep, his eyes reddened with wrath, that tiger among
  men became like a fire wreathed in smoke.
'30': >-
  With a tongue as it were flickering like the barbs of arrows, bearing the
  coils of bow and quiver, born of the poison of his own fiery might—he was like
  a five-hooded serpent.
'31': >-
  Approaching him—like the blazing fire of Time, like an enraged lord of
  elephants—Angada, struck with terror, fell into deep despair.
'32': >-
  Then Sugriva, of great renown, his eyes copper-red with anger, commanded
  Angada: “Go, dear child; tell him of my coming.”
'33': >-
  “This younger brother of Rama has arrived at your presence, O subduer of foes;
  Lakshmana, scorched by his brother’s calamity, stands at the gate.”
'34': >-
  “If my words find favor, O noble vanara, let what is proper be done. Having
  spoken thus, come quickly, dear child, O subduer of foes, with my message.”
'35': >-
  Hearing Lakshmana’s words, Angada, overwhelmed with grief, said: “This son of
  Sumitra has come, drawing near to my father.”
'36': >-
  Then Angada, agitated and with a face cast down, moved by those exceedingly
  sharp words, went out first and, with speed, bowed at the feet of Ruma, as to
  a queen.
'37': >-
  Having clasped the feet of his father of terrible splendor, he again took hold
  of his mother’s feet; and, pressing Ruma’s feet as well, he then conveyed that
  matter.
'38': >-
  Sugriva, a vanara, surrounded by the weariness of sleep, did not awaken; he
  was intoxicated with pride, and also deluded by passion.
'39': >-
  Then the vanaras raised loud cries on seeing Lakshmana, seeking to appease him
  in his anger, their minds shaken by fear.
'40': >-
  Seeing him like a great flood, with a roar like the thunderbolt and lightning,
  they raised a lion-like shout near Lakshmana.
'41': >-
  By that great sound the vanara awoke—his coppery eyes unsteady from
  intoxication, confused, adorned with garlands and ornaments.
'42': >-
  Then, having heard Angada’s words, and arriving with him, came the two
  ministers of the vanara-king, approved and of noble appearance.
'43': >-
  Plaksha and Prabhava—ministers well-versed in policy and
  righteousness—declared to him the arrival of Lakshmana, and what was to be
  spoken, in due measure.
'44': >-
  Having pacified Sugriva with words that were purposeful and firmly reasoned,
  they attended upon him as he sat—just as the Maruts attend upon Indra, lord of
  the gods.
'45': >-
  “Rama and Lakshmana, the truthful-minded and greatly fortunate brothers, have
  come in the guise of men—worthy of sovereignty, and givers of kingdoms.”
'46': >-
  “Of the two, Lakshmana, bow in hand, stands at the gate—before whom the
  vanaras, frightened and trembling, do not even utter their cries.”
'47': >-
  “This is Lakshmana, the brother of the Raghava, who guides his speech with
  purpose; he has arrived, mounted on the chariot of resolve, by Rama’s
  command.”
'48': >-
  “And this, O king, is Angada—Tara’s beloved son—sent swiftly by Lakshmana to
  you, O sinless one.”
'49': >-
  “He, mighty in valor, with eyes possessed by wrath, stands at the gate, O lord
  of vanaras, as though burning the vanaras with his very gaze.”
'50': >-
  “Go quickly, great king, with your son and kinsmen, and bow your head to him;
  for today his wrath must indeed be calmed.”
'51': >-
  “As Rama is righteous-souled, so do you act with gathered mind. O king, stand
  true to your appointed time; be faithful to your promise.”
'52': >-
  Thus ends the Thirty-first Sarga of the Kishkindha Kanda in the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the primeval epic, named “Lakshmana’s Wrath.”
