  Now begins the sixty-third canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Narration of the Means for Slaying Lavaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma, the mighty Śatrughna, possessed of great prowess, was
  overcome with deep shame and, slowly, slowly, spoke these words.
'2': >-
  “O Kākutstha, O lord of men, I understand that in this matter it is
  unrighteous: how can the younger be consecrated while the elder brothers are
  still present?”
'3': >-
  “Yet it is surely a command that must be carried out, O best of men; and your
  ordinance, O highly fortunate one, is indeed hard to transgress.”
'4': >-
  “From you I have heard it, O hero, and I have also heard it from the sacred
  tradition (śruti). Therefore I have no reply to speak, once the middle brother
  has given his pledge.”
'5': >-
  “A dreadful, ill-spoken utterance has been spoken by me—‘I shall slay Lavaṇa
  in battle.’ For such harsh speech of mine, what evil fate may await me, O best
  of men!”
'6': >-
  “One ought not speak an answer again after what the elder has declared—an act
  allied with unrighteousness and bereft of merit for the other world.”
'7': >-
  “Therefore I, O Kākutstha, will not utter a second reply to you. Let not a
  second chastisement fall upon me, O giver of honor.”
'8': >-
  “I am at your disposal as you will, O king, O best of men. O Kākutstha, O
  delight of the Raghus, abandon unrighteousness for my sake.”
'9': >-
  When the heroic, great-souled Śatrughna had spoken thus, Rāma, rejoicing,
  spoke to Bharata and likewise to Lakṣmaṇa:
'10': >-
  “With composed minds, bring the requisites for the consecration. This very day
  I shall consecrate the tiger among men, the Rāghava (Śatrughna).”
'11': >-
  “And bring, by my command, the family priest of the Kākutsthas, the
  guild-leaders with the officiating priests, and all those ministers as well.”
'12': >-
  Knowing the king’s command, those great chariot-warriors did so. With the
  consecration-ceremonies set in motion and the chaplain placed at the fore,
  kings and brāhmaṇas alike entered the royal palace.
'13': >-
  Thus the consecration of the great-souled Śatrughna proceeded and
  swelled—splendid and joy-giving to Rāghava’s city as well.
'14': >-
  Consecrated, Śatrughna shone like the sun—like Skanda of old when consecrated
  amid the hosts of the Maruts with Indra.
'15': >-
  And when Śatrughna had been consecrated by Rāma of untiring deeds, the
  citizens rejoiced, and the well-versed brāhmaṇas also were filled with
  delight.
'16': >-
  Kauśalyā and Sumitrā and Kaikeyī performed auspicious rites in the royal
  palace, as did the other women of the royal household.
'17': >-
  And the great-souled ṛṣis dwelling on the banks of the Yamunā hoped for the
  slaying of Lavaṇa upon Śatrughna’s consecration.
'18': >-
  Then Rāghava, taking the consecrated Śatrughna up upon his lap, spoke sweet
  words, filling him with ardor and splendor:
'19': >-
  “This arrow of yours is unfailing—divine, a conqueror of hostile citadels.
  With this, O gentle one, you shall slay Lavaṇa, O delight of the Raghus.”
'20': >-
  “This arrow, O Kākutstha, was created at the time when the Lord lay upon the
  great ocean.”
'21': >-
  “It belonged to the Unconquered Self-born Deity, whom gods and asuras could
  not behold; unseen by all beings—therefore this is the foremost of arrows.”
'22': >-
  “It was created by Him when overcome with wrath, for the destruction of the
  wicked—Madhu and Kaiṭabha—O hero, who were then engaged in violence and havoc.
  Wishing to create the three worlds, He slew those two with this in battle.”
'23': >-
  “Having slain Kaiṭabha and Madhu with this chief of arrows for the sake of
  beings’ enjoyment and sustenance, He then fashioned the worlds.”
'24': >-
  “I did not formerly discharge this arrow, O Śatrughna, even when I sought to
  kill Rāvaṇa, thinking: ‘There would arise a great terror among all beings.’”
'25': >-
  “And as for that mighty trident of his—given by the great-souled Tryambaka
  (Śiva) for the destruction of foes—Madhu’s supreme weapon,”},{
'26': >-
  “casting it down within his dwelling, he is worshiped again and again; and
  then, ranging in all directions, he obtains excellent food.”
'27': >-
  “But when someone, desiring battle, should challenge him, then seizing that
  trident he indeed turns the rākṣasa to ashes.”
'28': >-
  “Therefore you, O tiger among men—having deprived him of that weapon—before he
  has entered the city, stand at the gate, holding your weapons ready.”
'29': >-
  “And before he has entered his house, O best of men, challenge him to battle,
  O mighty-armed one; then you shall slay the rākṣasa.”
'30': >-
  “Otherwise, if it is done differently, he will become invincible; but if this
  is done as described, O hero, he will go to destruction.”
'31': >-
  “All this has been told to you, including how his trident may be thwarted. The
  ordinance connected with the illustrious Blue-throated Lord (Śiva) is indeed
  hard to transgress.”
'32': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-third canto in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, called “The Narration of the Means for
  Slaying Lavaṇa.”
