  Now begins the seventy-fifth sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Praise and Account of the Vaiṣṇava Bow.”
'1': >-
  “Rāma, son of Daśaratha, O heroic one—thy wondrous prowess is heard of; and
  the breaking of the bow also I have heard in full.”
'2': >-
  “That breaking of the bow is marvellous and inconceivable indeed. Having heard
  thereof, I have come hither, bearing another excellent and auspicious bow.”
'3': >-
  “This mighty bow, terrible in semblance—the great bow of Jāmadagnya—do thou
  string it with an arrow, and do thou display thine own strength.”
'4': >-
  “And when I have beheld thy strength in the very stringing of this bow, I
  shall grant thee a duel in battle—O thou whose valour I desire to test and to
  proclaim.”
'5': >-
  Hearing those words of his, King Daśaratha then, with face cast down in sorrow
  and wretched, spoke with joined palms, saying:
'6': >-
  “Thou art calmed from the wrath of the kṣatriya, and thou art a Brāhmaṇa of
  great austerities. Thou oughtest to grant fearlessness to my sons, who are but
  youths.”
'7': >-
  “Born in the lineage of the Bhārgavas, endowed with vows and devoted to sacred
  study, thou didst, after making a vow before Indra of the thousand eyes, cast
  away thy weapons.”
'8': >-
  “Thereafter, being devoted to righteousness, having given this earth to
  Kaśyapa, thou didst repair to the forest, making thy abode upon Mahendra.”
'9': >-
  “Thou, O great sage, hast now come hither for my utter ruin; for if even one
  Rāma be slain, none of us shall remain alive.”
'10': >-
  While Daśaratha spoke thus, the mighty Jāmadagnya, scorning those words,
  addressed Rāma alone:
'11': >-
  “These two bows are the best—divine, worshipped in the worlds; firm, mighty,
  foremost, and well-fashioned by Viśvakarman.”
'12': >-
  “One was fashioned by the gods for Tryambaka (Śiva) when he desired to fight.
  That bow, O best of men—O Kākutstha—thou hast broken, the destroyer of
  Tripura.”
'13': >-
  “This second, hard to assail, was given to Viṣṇu by the foremost of the gods.
  This indeed is the Vaiṣṇava bow, O Rāma, the vanquisher of enemy cities.”
'14': >-
  “This Vaiṣṇava bow, O Kākutstha, is equal in power to the Rudra bow. Then did
  all the deities question the Grandsire (Brahmā).”
'15': >-
  “Considering the strength and the weakness of Śitikaṇṭha (Śiva) and of Viṣṇu,
  the Grandsire, having understood the intent of the gods, ”
'16': >-
  “—that best of the truthful—brought about opposition between the two. And from
  that opposition there arose a great war, causing the hair to stand on end.”
'17': >-
  “Between Śitikaṇṭha and Viṣṇu, each seeking to conquer the other—then was the
  Śaiva bow stretched, of dreadful might.”
'18': >-
  “By a mere roar (huṃkāra) was Mahādeva, the three-eyed lord, restrained. Then
  the gods, together with hosts of ṛṣis and with the Cāraṇas, assembled there,”
'19': >-
  “and entreated those two foremost of the gods to make peace, and thus they
  desisted. And when they beheld that Śaiva bow stretched by the prowess of
  Viṣṇu,”
'20': >-
  “the gods, together with the companies of ṛṣis, deemed Viṣṇu the superior. But
  Rudra, greatly renowned, being angered, bestowed the bow, with its arrows,
  into the hand of the royal sage of Videha, Devarāta (Janaka).”
'21': >-
  “And this very Vaiṣṇava bow, O Rāma, the conqueror of hostile cities, (came
  thus to him).”
'22': >-
  “Viṣṇu gave this excellent trust unto the Bhārgava Ṛcīka; and that mighty,
  radiant Ṛcīka—unto his son, who was without a peer in prowess,”
'23': >-
  “gave it—unto my sire, the noble Jamadagni—this divine bow, when my father,
  possessed of ascetic power, had laid aside his weapons.”
'24': >-
  “But Arjuna, taking to an unworthy understanding, brought about my father’s
  death, an ordinary and shameful death. Hearing of that most dreadful and
  unfitting slaying of my sire, in wrath I destroyed the kṣatriyas again and
  again, as they arose.”
'25': >-
  “And having obtained the entire earth, I gave it at the end of a sacrifice to
  the great-souled Kaśyapa, O Rāma, as the sacrificial fee, for that holy rite.”
'26': >-
  “Having bestowed it, I—dwelling on Mahendra and endowed with the power of
  austerities—upon hearing of the breaking of the bow, came hither swiftly.”
'27': >-
  “Thus, O Rāma, this mighty Vaiṣṇava bow is ancestral—of my father and of my
  forefathers. Upholding the duty of the kṣatriya, take thou this excellent
  bow.”
'28': >-
  “Set an arrow upon this best of bows, O conqueror of enemy cities. If thou art
  able, O Kākutstha, then will I grant thee a duel thereafter.”
'29': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-fifth sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, entitled “The Praise and Account of the Vaiṣṇava
  Bow.”
