  Now begins the thirty-eighth canto of Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The People’s Outcry.”
'1': >-
  When she (Sītā) had put on bark-garments—though having a lord, she appeared as
  one without a protector—then all the people cried out aloud, “Fie upon you,
  Daśaratha!”
'2': >-
  By that uproar there, the lord of the earth became sorely afflicted, and he
  cut off, as it were, all confidence in his own life, in righteousness, and in
  his personal fame.
'3': >-
  Sighing hotly, that Ikṣvāku (Daśaratha) spoke to that wife (Kaikeyī) these
  words: “Kaikeyī, Sītā does not deserve to go (to the forest) clad in
  kusa-grass and bark.”
'4': >-
  “She is delicate, and she is but a young girl, and ever accustomed to comfort.
  ‘She is not fit for the forest’—my preceptor truly said this.”
'5': >-
  “What harm at all does she do to anyone—she, an ascetic-like princess, the
  daughter of a foremost king—who, having assumed bark-garments, stands
  senseless in the midst of the people, like some wandering female mendicant?”
'6': >-
  “Let the daughter of Janaka cast aside the bark-garments. This is not a
  promise that I gave before. Let the princess go to the forest in comfort,
  whole and entire, together with all her jewels.”
'7': >-
  “I, unworthy to live, have indeed made a cruel promise, bound by my vow. But
  you have held to this from childhood; let it not burn me up, like a bamboo set
  aflame from within by its own blossom.”
'8': >-
  “If, O sinful woman, Rāma has done anything improper to you, what injury has
  Vaidehī shown you here, O vile one?”
'9': >-
  “With eyes like a startled doe, gentle in nature and high-minded—what harm,
  indeed, does Janaka’s daughter do to you?”
'10': >-
  “Surely it is enough for you, O sinful woman, that Rāma has been banished. Why
  again these wretched further sins also, committed by you?”
'11': >-
  “So much, indeed, has been promised by me while listening to you, O lady, when
  you came here and spoke that Rāma should be consecrated for kingship.”
'12': >-
  “Transgressing even that truth, do you wish to go to hell—you who even look
  upon Maithilī as one wearing bark-garments?”
'13': >-
  While his father was speaking thus, Rāma—about to depart for the forest—said
  this word to him, as he sat with head bowed down.
'14': >-
  “This my mother, the righteous Kauśalyā, illustrious, aged, and of gentle
  disposition—she does not reproach you, O lord.”
'15': >-
  “Do you, O bestower of boons, show compassion again to her—deprived of me,
  having sought refuge in you—who is plunged into an ocean of sorrow and has
  never before known such calamity.”
'16': >-
  “So that she, honored by you who are worthy of honor, may not sink beneath
  grief for her son—thinking of me, that austere lady would live, so long as you
  live.”
'17': >-
  “You ought to so provide for my mother—eager for her son, and resembling
  Mahendra (in steadfastness)—that, when I dwell in the forest, she, wasted by
  grief, may not abandon her life and go to Yama’s imperishable abode.”
'18': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-eighth canto of Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The People’s
  Outcry.”
