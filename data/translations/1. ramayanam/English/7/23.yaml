  Now begins the twenty-third canto, called “The Conquest of Varuṇa,” in the
  Uttara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Thereupon, having vanquished Yama, the foremost among the gods,
  Daśagrīva—Rāvaṇa, famed for his boast of battle—looked again upon his own
  allies.
'2': >-
  Seeing Rāvaṇa with his limbs drenched in blood and shattered by many blows,
  the rākṣasas approached him and stood near him.
'3': >-
  Then, having increased their joy by that victory, all of them—headed by
  Mārīca—went to the Puṣpaka aerial chariot, being consoled indeed by Rāvaṇa.
'4': >-
  Thereafter, proceeding to Rasātala, he entered the treasury of waters—haunted
  by hosts of daityas and serpents, and guarded by Varuṇa.
'5': >-
  And having reached Bhogavatī, the city protected by Vāsuki, he brought the
  nāgas under his control and, exultant, went on to the city that was made of
  jewels.
'6': >-
  There dwelt the daityas called Nivātakavacas, possessors of boons. Approaching
  the rākṣasa’s son, they challenged him to battle.
'7': >-
  All of them were exceedingly valiant, mighty daityas, furnished there with
  weapons of many kinds—delighted and maddened with lust for war.
'8': >-
  With spears and tridents, with thunderbolts, battle-axes, swords, and
  hatchets, the rākṣasas and the dānavas, enraged, pierced one another.
'9': >-
  While they thus fought, a full year passed; yet neither side gained victory
  there, nor did either meet with destruction.
'10': >-
  Then the Grandsire (Brahmā), the imperishable guide of the three worlds, came
  there swiftly, the god seated upon an excellent aerial car.
'11': >-
  Restraining the warlike deed of the Nivātakavacas, the aged Grandsire spoke
  words as one who knew the matter fully.
'12': >-
  “Indeed this Rāvaṇa cannot be conquered in battle by gods and asuras; nor can
  you be brought to destruction, even by the dānavas together with the gods.
'13': >-
  “Therefore friendship with the rākṣasa is pleasing for you to accept. And all
  aims shall be shared without division among friends—of this there is no doubt.
'14': >-
  Then, there in the presence of Agni as witness, Rāvaṇa made friendship with
  the Nivātakavacas, and at that time became filled with goodwill.
'15': >-
  Thereafter, abiding with them for a year in due and proper manner, Daśānana
  obtained from his own city affection and honor without distinction.
'16': >-
  Then, having mastered a hundred māyās (arts of illusion), he wandered through
  Rasātala, seeking the city of the Lord of Waters.
'17': >-
  Then he went to the place called Aśmanagara, inhabited by the Kālakas; and
  having slain there those mighty Kālakas of tremendous strength,
'18': >-
  he cut down with his sword Śūrpaṇakhā’s husband, and also her powerful
  brother-in-law Vidyujjihva, of fierce might, who was licking with his tongue
  (in arrogance) even in battle.
'19': Having conquered him in but a moment, he slew four hundred daityas as well.
'20': >-
  Then the lord of rākṣasas beheld the divine abode of Varuṇa—like Mount
  Kailāsa, radiant, and resembling a pale cloud.
'21': >-
  And there he saw the fragrant cow Surabhi stationed, dripping milk—by the
  outflow of whose milk the ocean is called Kṣīroda, the Milk Ocean.
'22': >-
  There Rāvaṇa saw the supreme bull, the foremost of cattle, by whose origin the
  moon comes forth—the night-maker with cooling rays.
'23': >-
  Depending upon whom live the great sages who drink foam; and where amṛta
  arose, and also svadhā for those who partake of svadhā.
'24': >-
  She whom men in the world call by name “Surabhi”—having circumambulated that
  most marvelous one,
'25': >-
  Rāvaṇa entered a very dreadful place, guarded by forces of many kinds. Then he
  beheld Varuṇa’s most excellent mansion, ever joyous, white like autumn clouds
  and filled all around with hundreds of streaming cascades.
'26': >-
  Then, after slaying the commanders of the forces in battle—though struck by
  them as well—he spoke to the warriors: “Go quickly and make it known to the
  king.
'27': >-
  ‘Rāvaṇa has come, desiring battle; let battle be granted to him. Or else say
  with joined palms: “Do not fear; I have been conquered.”’”
'28': >-
  In the meantime, the sons and grandsons of the great-souled Varuṇa—together
  with Gau and Puṣkara—angrily came forth.
'29': >-
  Endowed with valor and excellence, surrounded by their own forces, they yoked
  chariots that could go as one wished, and they rose forth with shining
  splendor.
'30': >-
  Then there occurred a dreadful, hair-raising battle between the sons of the
  Lord of Waters and the wise Rāvaṇa.
'31': >-
  And by the ministers of Daśagrīva, the rākṣasa of great prowess, that entire
  Varuṇa host was, in a moment, laid low.
'32': >-
  Then the sons of Varuṇa, seeing their own army in the battle, afflicted by a
  net of arrows, withdrew from the work of war.
'33': >-
  But when they, having reached the ground, saw Rāvaṇa in the Puṣpaka, they
  quickly entered the sky in swift-going chariots.
'34': >-
  Then, having regained an equal position with them, there arose a tumultuous
  battle in the air, like that between gods and dānavas.
'35': >-
  Then, having turned Rāvaṇa away in battle with arrows like blazing fire, they
  were satisfied and sent forth various cries.
'36': >-
  Then Mahodara, enraged on seeing the king insulted, casting aside fear of
  death, the hero—longing for battle—looked on.
'37': >-
  With his mace, Mahodara slew in battle those dreadful ones whose chariots
  could move at will, swift as the wind, and they fell upon the earth.
'38': >-
  Having slain the warriors and hundreds of horses of Varuṇa’s sons, and seeing
  them standing chariotless, he quickly let out a great roar.
'39': >-
  And their chariots with horses—together with their charioteers—slain by
  Mahodara, fell upon the surface of the earth.
'40': >-
  But those heroic sons of the great-souled Varuṇa, abandoning their chariots,
  remained stationed in the sky; by their own power they did not falter.
'41': >-
  Stringing their bows, they pierced Mahodara and, furious, together rushed upon
  Rāvaṇa in battle.
'42': >-
  With dreadful arrows, hard as thunderbolts, they tore into him in wrath, as
  storm-clouds rend a mighty mountain.
'43': >-
  Then Daśagrīva, enraged like the fire of time bursting forth, struck at their
  vital parts with most terrible showers of arrows.
'44': >-
  Then, suddenly by that very assault, the foot-soldiers began to sink (and
  collapse). Thereupon were hurled variegated maces and then hundreds of
  bhalla-arrows.
'45': >-
  From above them, the unassailable one rained down upon them battle-axes,
  spears, sataghnīs, and tomaras as well.
'46': >-
  Those heroes, struck down, fell headlong—like sixty-year-old elephants
  collapsing after plunging into deep mire.
'47': >-
  Seeing the sons (of Varuṇa) sinking down, bewildered though of very great
  might, Rāvaṇa roared in exultation like a great rain-cloud.
'48': >-
  Then that rākṣasa, after releasing a mighty roar, slew the Varuṇas, with many
  weapons—like a cloud with torrents of rain.
'49': >-
  Then all of them, turned away and fallen upon the earth, were quickly led from
  the battlefield by their own attendants into their houses.
'50': 'Then the rākṣasa said: “Let it be reported to Varuṇa.”'
'51': >-
  Then the minister of Varuṇa, named Prahasta, spoke to Rāvaṇa: “The great king,
  the Lord of Waters, has gone indeed to Brahmaloka.
'52': >-
  “Varuṇa has gone to hear a gāndharva performance—he whom you challenge to
  battle. Therefore, O hero, what is the use of your toiling in vain when the
  king has departed? Those princes who were present here—those heroes—have been
  defeated.”
'53': >-
  Hearing this, the lord of rākṣasas proclaimed his own name aloud; and,
  releasing a cry of triumph, he departed from Varuṇa’s abode.
'54': >-
  Returning by the very same path by which he had come, that rākṣasa, moving
  through the sky, went toward Laṅkā.
'55': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-third canto, called “The Conquest of Varuṇa,” in the
  Uttara Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
