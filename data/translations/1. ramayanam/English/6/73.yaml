  Now begins the seventy-third canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Indrajit’s Battle by Illusion (Māyā-yuddha).”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, the surviving hosts of rākṣasas, after those foremost of their
  kind—Devāntaka, Trisiro, Atikāya, and the like—had been slain, hurried to
  Rāvaṇa and swiftly reported what had occurred.
'2': >-
  Then the king, hearing in a moment that they had been slain, his eyes flooded
  with great tears, reflected deeply and at length, brooding upon the
  destruction of his sons and the dreadful slaying of his brothers.
'3': >-
  Seeing the king sunk in misery, overwhelmed and as though plunged into an
  ocean of grief, Indrajit—the mighty chariot-warrior, son of the lord of
  rākṣasas—addressed him with these words:
'4': >-
  “Father, O lord of the rākṣasas, you ought not to fall into delusion so long
  as Indrajit yet lives. For no one, struck down by the arrows of Indra’s foe,
  has the power to retain his life upon the battlefield.”
'5': >-
  “Behold today Rāma together with Lakṣmaṇa—his body pierced through by my
  shafts and torn asunder—his life departed, lying upon the earth, all his limbs
  covered over with my sharp arrows.”
'6': >-
  “Hear this vow of Indra’s enemy, firmly resolved, yoked both to manly prowess
  and to destiny: this very day I shall fully sate Rāma together with Lakṣmaṇa
  with unfailing arrows.”
'7': >-
  “Today Indra, Yama, Viṣṇu, Rudra, the Sādhyas, Fire, the Moon, and the Sun
  shall behold my immeasurable valor—terrible as that of Viṣṇu at the
  sacrifice-ground of Bali.”
'8': >-
  Having spoken thus, the enemy of the lord of the gods, unwearied in spirit,
  took leave of the king and mounted his chariot—swift as the wind—harnessed
  with the finest asses and perfectly equipped.
'9': >-
  That great-souled warrior, mounting the mighty chariot resembling the chariot
  of Indra, went at once to the place where the battle was raging, the subduer
  of foes.
'10': >-
  Many great and powerful warriors followed that magnanimous one as he set out,
  exulting, with excellent bows in their hands.
'11': >-
  Some rode upon the shoulders of elephants; some upon supremely swift horses;
  and others upon beasts such as tigers, scorpions, cats, asses, camels,
  serpents, and the like.
'12': >-
  Others rode upon boars, wild beasts, lions, and jackals huge as mountains; and
  there were rākṣasas of dreadful prowess with crows, swans, and peacocks as
  well.
'13': >-
  They bore spears, pattisas, swords, axes, and maces; and weapons such as
  bhūśuṇḍīs, mallets, clubs, lances, śataghnīs, and iron bars.
'14': >-
  Filled with the full blare of conches and the booming sound of kettledrums,
  the mighty enemy of the lord of the gods sped forth in a long array with great
  swiftness.
'15': >-
  Beneath a parasol white as a conch-shell and the moon, that slayer of foes
  shone, like the sky when filled by the moon in its fullness.
'16': >-
  Then the hero, adorned with golden ornaments, was fanned with splendid and
  foremost yak-tail whisks—he, the chief among all bowmen.
'17': >-
  Seeing him setting out, surrounded by a great army, the illustrious lord of
  rākṣasas, Rāvaṇa, spoke to his son:
'18': >-
  “Son, you are without equal as a chariot-warrior; by you indeed Vāsava (Indra)
  has been conquered. How much more, then, will you slay Rāghava—the audacious
  mere man?”
'19': >-
  Thus addressed by the king of rākṣasas, Indrajit accepted those great
  blessings. Thereupon Laṅkā, through Indrajit’s sun-like radiance, shone forth
  brilliantly.
'20': >-
  With that unsurpassed might, he blazed like the sky with the shining sun.
  Reaching the field of battle, that great, foe-subduing warrior arrived.
'21': >-
  He stationed the rākṣasas all around his chariot. Then, radiant like the very
  Fire-god, the best of rākṣasas began to offer oblations according to rule with
  the most excellent mantras.
'22': >-
  With offerings of parched grain as sacrificial food, preceded by garlands and
  perfumes, the mighty lord of rākṣasas made oblation there into the fire.
'23': >-
  He offered into the blazing fire weapons and bundles of arrows as fuel-sticks,
  and bibhītaka-wood as kindling.
'24': >-
  He offered also red garments, and a ladle of black iron. Having spread the
  fire-altar there with arrow-bundles and spears,
'25': >-
  he seized the throat of a living black-colored goat. At that very moment, when
  the fire was well kindled—smokeless and with great flames—
'26': >-
  those signs appeared which indicated victory: the flame curled to the right,
  and it gleamed like molten gold.
'27': >-
  The fire, rising of itself, received that oblation. Then Indrajit, skilled in
  the Brahmā-weapon, proceeded to bring forth that missile.
'28': >-
  He consecrated with mantras his bow, his own chariot, and all his equipment
  there. And as that missile was being invoked and the fire was being offered
  into, the vault of heaven—with sun, planets, moon, and constellations—grew
  afraid and trembled.
'29': >-
  Having thus offered into the fire, he whose splendor was like
  Mahendra’s—Indrajit, blazing with fire-like radiance—together with bow,
  arrows, sword, chariot, horses, and charioteer, vanished into the sky,
  concealing himself by his inconceivable might.
'30': >-
  Then the rākṣasa army, filled with horses and chariots, adorned with banners
  and standards, marched out roaring, eager for battle.
'31': >-
  With many shafts of varied kind, sharp and swift, and also with spears and
  goads, they struck down the vānaras in the fight.
'32': >-
  But Rāvaṇa’s son, exceedingly wrathful, looking upon those night-rangers,
  said: “Rejoice, and fight—intent on slaying the vānaras!”
'33': >-
  Then all those rākṣasas, roaring and desiring victory, poured a dreadful hail
  of arrows upon the vānaras.
'34': >-
  Surrounded by rākṣasas in the battle, he dragged down the vānaras with iron
  arrows and long shafts, and also with maces and clubs.
'35': >-
  The vānaras, being slain in the combat—those whose weapons were trees—suddenly
  rained down upon Indrajit rocks and uprooted trees.
'36': >-
  Then Indrajit, enraged, of great splendor and great strength, crushed and tore
  the bodies of the vānaras—Rāvaṇa’s son.
'37': >-
  With a single arrow he pierced nine, five, and seven monkeys in the battle,
  fighting in fury and delighting the rākṣasas.
'38': >-
  With arrows bright as the sun and adorned with gold, that hero, hard to
  conquer, utterly smote the vānaras in the fight.
'39': >-
  Their limbs rent asunder in battle, tortured by arrows, the vānaras fell,
  their resolve shattered—like mighty asuras struck down by the gods.
'40': >-
  The bull-like vānaras, enraged, charged him in the fray—him who was like the
  scorching sun with dreadful shafts for his sunbeams.
'41': >-
  Then all the vānaras, their bodies broken and their senses confused, afflicted
  and drenched in blood, began to flee.
'42': >-
  Yet for Rāma’s sake, the vānaras, having staked their lives, did not turn
  back: roaring, they fought on in the battle with rocks as their weapons.
'43': >-
  With trees, mountain-peaks, and boulders, those monkeys standing firm rained
  blows upon Indrajit in the fight.
'44': >-
  That vast, deadly shower of trees and rocks, Indrajit—of great splendor,
  conqueror in battle—warded off and drove away.
'45': >-
  Then with arrows like blazing fire, like poisonous serpents, that lord split
  apart the vānaras’ divisions in the battle.
'46': >-
  Piercing Gandhamādana with eighteen sharp arrows, he also struck Nala—standing
  at a distance—with nine.
'47': >-
  The great hero pierced Mainda with seven, tearing at the vital parts; and with
  five barbed arrows he pierced Gaja in the combat.
'48': >-
  Jāmbavān he pierced with ten, Nīla with fully thirty; and likewise Sugrīva the
  bull, and also Aṅgada and Dvivida.
'49': >-
  With dreadful, keen missiles—boons granted to him—he then made them lifeless;
  and in the same manner, with many arrows, he struck down other foremost
  vānaras as well.
'50': >-
  Enraged, he harassed them like the raging fire of time at dissolution. With
  arrows bright as the sun, well released and swiftly moving,
'51': >-
  he ground to pieces the vānaras’ divisions in that great battle. He beheld the
  monkey host in confusion, oppressed by a net of arrows.
'52': >-
  Delighted with supreme joy, the powerful son of the lord of rākṣasas, of great
  splendor, saw them drenched in blood. Again,
'53': >-
  sending forth a shower of arrows and a dreadful shower of weapons, Indrajit,
  mighty, crushed the vānaras’ divisions on every side.
'54': >-
  Leaving aside his own troops, and swiftly coming close amid the vānaras in the
  great battle, unseen, he poured forth a fierce net of arrows—like a dark
  rain-cloud pouring down water.
'55': >-
  Their bodies shattered by the arrows of Śakra’s conqueror, struck down by
  illusion, crying out hoarsely and discordantly, the
  monkey-warriors—mountain-like—fell in battle like great peaks smitten by
  Indra’s thunderbolt.
'56': >-
  They saw only the sharp-pointed arrows upon the battlefield among the monkey
  hosts; but the foe of the lord of the gods, hidden by māyā, they did not see
  there—nor did they behold even that rākṣasa.
'57': >-
  Then that great-souled lord of rākṣasas covered all directions with clusters
  of sharp-pointed arrows, radiant as the sun, and he tore apart the monkey
  chiefs.
'58': >-
  He rained down fiercely upon the army of the monkey-lord spears, swords, and
  axes—whirled about—gleaming like blazing fire; like flames bright with sparks.
'59': >-
  Then the leaders of the monkey troops, struck by the arrows of Śakra’s
  conqueror—arrows like blazing fire—appeared like blossoming kiṃśuka trees.
'60': >-
  Drawing close to one another and crying out in broken voices, those bull-like
  vānaras, pierced by the rākṣasa lord’s weapon, fell to the ground in battle.
'61': >-
  Some, looking up to the sky, were struck in their eyes; pierced by arrows,
  they crashed into one another and fell upon the face of the earth.
'62': >-
  Hanumān, and Sugrīva, and Aṅgada, and Gandhamādana; and Jāmbavān, and Suṣeṇa,
  and Vegadarśin as well;
'63': >-
  and Mainda, and Dvivida, and Nīla, and Gavākṣa, and Gavaya; and Keśarī, and
  Harilomā, and the monkey Vidyuddaṃṣṭra;
'64': >-
  Sūryānana, Jyotirmukha, and likewise the monkey Dadhimukha; and Pāvakākṣa, and
  Nala, and also the monkey Kumuda;
'65': >-
  all those tiger-like monkeys the best of rākṣasas pierced with spears,
  tridents, and sharp arrows—consecrated with mantras by Indrajit.
'66': >-
  Having split the foremost leaders of the monkey hosts with maces, and with
  golden-hued arrows, he poured upon Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa nets of arrow-showers
  like the rays of the sun.
'67': >-
  While being rained upon by those showers of arrows—like the fall of
  torrents—Rāma, untroubled, and gazing, spoke then to Lakṣmaṇa, wondrous in
  splendor:
'68': >-
  “O Lakṣmaṇa, yonder lord among rākṣasas—Indra’s foe—has resorted again to the
  Brahmā-weapon. Having felled the monkey army, he now assails us relentlessly
  with sharp arrows.”
'69': >-
  “That great-souled one has received a boon from the Self-born (Brahmā);
  composed in mind, with his dreadful body concealed from sight—how can
  Indrajit, his body vanished in battle and his weapon raised, be slain today?”
'70': >-
  “I deem the Self-born Lord, inconceivable, to be the source of that missile
  and the origin of his power. Therefore, O wise one, today, together with me,
  with a steady and unagitated mind, endure here this downpour of arrows.”
'71': >-
  “For this lord of rākṣasas covers all the directions with nets of
  arrow-showers. And because the foremost heroes have fallen, the army of the
  monkey-king does not now shine forth at all.”
'72': >-
  “Seeing us both fallen, unconscious—turned away from battle, with joy and
  wrath extinguished—he will surely enter the abode of the enemies of the gods,
  attaining the foremost fortune of the battlefield.”
'73': >-
  Then there, at that time, the two of them (Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa) were grievously
  wounded by Indrajit’s nets of missiles; and having thus cast them into
  despair, the lord among rākṣasas roared in battle for joy.
'74': >-
  Then, having thus suddenly cast into despair the monkey army and Rāma as well
  together with Lakṣmaṇa in the battle, he entered the city protected by the
  arms of Daśagrīva. Praised by the yakṣa-like rākṣasas, delighted, he went to
  his father and reported everything.
'75': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-third canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “Indrajit’s Battle by Illusion
  (Māyā-yuddha).”
