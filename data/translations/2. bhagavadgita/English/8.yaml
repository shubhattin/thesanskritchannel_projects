'0': Thus begins the Holy Bhagavad Gita.
'1': >-
  Now, the Eighth Chapter: The Yoga of the Imperishable Brahman
  (Akshara-Brahma-Yoga).
'2': 'Arjuna said:'
'3': >-
  What is that Brahman? What is the Self (adhyatma)? What is action (karma), O
  Supreme Person? And what is called the elemental realm (adhibhuta)? What is
  said to be the divine realm (adhidaiva)?
'4': >-
  Who is the Lord of sacrifice (adhiyajna) here, and how is He (present) in this
  body, O Madhusudana? And at the time of departure, how are You to be known by
  the self-controlled (and steadfast-minded)?
'5': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'6': >-
  The Imperishable is the Supreme Brahman; its own inherent nature is called the
  Self (adhyatma). The offering-forth (visarga)—that which brings about the
  arising of the states of beings—is designated as action (karma).
'7': >-
  The perishable entity is the elemental realm (adhibhuta); and the Cosmic
  Person is the divine realm (adhidaiva). And I Myself am the Lord of sacrifice
  (adhiyajna) here in this body, O best of embodied beings.
'8': >-
  And at the final hour, he who, remembering Me alone, gives up the body and
  departs—he attains My state of being; of this there is no doubt.
'9': >-
  Whatever state of being one remembers when he gives up the body at the end, to
  that alone he goes, O son of Kunti—ever formed and conditioned by that state
  of being.
'10': >-
  Therefore, at all times remember Me and fight. With mind and intellect devoted
  and offered to Me, you shall surely come to Me—there is no doubt.
'11': >-
  With a mind yoked to the yoga of practice, not wandering elsewhere, meditating
  continually, one reaches the Supreme Divine Person, O Partha.
'12': >-
  He who remembers that Seer, the Ancient One, the Ruler (and Ordainer), subtler
  than the subtlest, the Sustainer of all, of inconceivable form, radiant like
  the sun, beyond the darkness (of ignorance)—
'13': >-
  at the time of departure, with an unwavering mind, endowed with devotion and
  with the strength of yoga, placing the life-breath rightly between the
  eyebrows—he attains that Supreme Divine Person.
'14': >-
  That Imperishable which the knowers of the Vedas declare; which the ascetics,
  free from attachment, enter; desiring which they practise brahmacharya—of that
  goal I shall speak to you briefly.
'15': >-
  Restraining all the gates (of the senses), confining the mind in the heart,
  and placing one’s life-breath upon the crown of the head—established in yogic
  concentration,
'16': >-
  uttering the one-syllabled Brahman, ‘Om,’ and remembering Me, he who departs,
  leaving the body, attains the supreme destination.
'17': >-
  For him who, with undivided mind, constantly remembers Me at all times, I am
  easy to attain, O Partha—(for) that yogin who is ever united (with Me).
'18': >-
  Having attained Me, the great-souled ones do not obtain rebirth—this
  impermanent abode of sorrow—for they have reached the highest perfection.
'19': >-
  All worlds, up to the world of Brahma, are subject to return again (to
  rebirth), O Arjuna; but having attained Me, O son of Kunti, there is no
  rebirth.
'20': >-
  Those people who know day and night know that the day of Brahma lasts for a
  thousand yugas, and that the night lasts for a thousand yugas.
'21': >-
  From the Unmanifest all manifested beings come forth at the coming of day; and
  at the coming of night they dissolve into that same (state) called the
  Unmanifest.
'22': >-
  This very multitude of beings, coming into being again and again, dissolves
  (at night’s coming); and, helpless, O Partha, it is born again at the coming
  of day.
'23': >-
  But beyond that Unmanifest there is another Existence, unmanifest, eternal;
  which, when all beings perish, does not perish.
'24': >-
  That Unmanifest is called the Imperishable; they declare it to be the supreme
  destination—having attained which they do not return. That is My supreme
  abode.
'25': >-
  That Supreme Person, O Partha, is attainable by exclusive devotion alone—He
  within whom all beings abide, and by whom all this is pervaded.
'26': >-
  Now I shall declare to you, O best of the Bharatas, the time (and path)
  departing in which yogins go to non-return, and (the time departing in which
  they go) to return again.
'27': >-
  Fire, light, daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern
  course of the sun—departing then, the knowers of Brahman go to Brahman.
'28': >-
  Smoke, night, the dark fortnight, the six months of the southern course of the
  sun—attaining then the lunar light, the yogin returns (again).
'29': >-
  These two paths—bright and dark—are indeed held to be the eternal ways of the
  world. By the one, one goes to non-return; by the other, one returns again.
'30': >-
  Knowing these two paths, O Partha, no yogin is deluded in any way. Therefore,
  at all times, be steadfastly devoted to yoga, O Arjuna.
'31': >-
  Whatever merit-fruit is declared in the Vedas, in sacrifices, in austerities,
  and also in gifts—having known all this, the yogin surpasses it all and
  attains the primal, supreme abode.
'32': >-
  ‘Om Tat Sat’—thus in the Upanishads of the Bhagavad Gita, in the science of
  Brahman, in the scripture of yoga, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna and
  Arjuna, ends the Eighth Chapter entitled “The Yoga of the Imperishable
  Brahman.”
