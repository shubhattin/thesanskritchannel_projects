  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-seventh sarga, entitled “Rāma’s Reply (to Bharata).”
'1': >-
  Then, as Bharata spoke in that manner again and again, Lakṣmaṇa’s elder
  brother—the illustrious Rāma, honored in the midst of his kinsmen—replied to
  him.
'2': >-
  This statement of yours is fitting, in that you have spoken thus: you were
  born as a son to Daśaratha, the most excellent of kings, through Kaikeyī.
'3': >-
  Formerly, brother, when our father took your mother in marriage, he heard from
  your maternal grandfather of an unsurpassed bridal-price—namely, the kingdom
  (to be given as a pledge).
'4': >-
  And in the battle between the devas and the asuras, your royal father, the
  sovereign lord, being greatly delighted and pleased with your mother’s
  service, granted her a boon.
'5': >-
  Then your glorious mother, having been thus assured, asked that best of
  men—the king—for two boons, she who was of excellent complexion and beauty.
'6': >-
  Your kingship, O tiger among men, and my banishment—these two; and the king,
  bound by his word, then granted those boons to her as enjoined.
'7': >-
  Therefore, by that father, I too was appointed here, O bull among men, to
  dwell in the forest for fourteen years, in accordance with the bestowal of the
  boon.
'8': >-
  So I have come to this lonely forest, accompanied by Lakṣmaṇa and by Sītā; and
  I, without a rival in this matter, stand established in truthfulness toward my
  father.
'9': >-
  You too, O lord of kings, should likewise make our father—who is true to his
  word—true to his word by proceeding swiftly to the consecration (as king).
'10': >-
  Release the king, our lord, from his debt incurred on my account, O Bharata;
  and honor as well your father, who knows dharma, and your mother too.
'11': >-
  For, dear child, a sacred utterance of old is heard—recited by the renowned
  Gaya while he was performing sacrifice, indeed at Gayā itself, concerning the
  forefathers.
'12': >-
  “Since a son delivers his father from the hell called ‘Puṃ,’ therefore he is
  called ‘putra’ (son),” because the son protects (pāti) the fathers.
'13': >-
  Many sons should be sought—endowed with virtues and well learned; and even
  among such assembled sons, it may be that only one will go to Gayā.
'14': >-
  All royal sages have been convinced of this, O delight of kings; therefore, O
  best of men, O lord, save your father from hell.
'15': >-
  Go to Ayodhyā, O Bharata; delight and win over the citizens and the people of
  the realm, O hero—together with Śatrughna and with all the twice-born.
'16': >-
  And I too, without delay, shall enter the Daṇḍaka forest—accompanied, O king,
  by these two: Vaidehī (Sītā) and Lakṣmaṇa.
'17': >-
  You, Bharata, be the king yourself over men; and I, though born of kings,
  shall be king over the forest-dwelling deer. Go today to the best of cities,
  rejoicing; and I too, gladdened, shall enter the Daṇḍakas.
'18': >-
  May the parasols, O Bharata, ward off for you the sun’s heat and make cool
  shade above your head. As for me, lying at ease, I shall happily take refuge
  in the shade of these forest trees.
'19': >-
  Śatrughna, of sound mind, is your helper; and the son of Sumitrā (Lakṣmaṇa) is
  known to me as my chief friend. We are four excellent sons of the king; O
  Bharata, established in truth, let us proceed—do not grieve.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-seventh sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the
  revered Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “Rāma’s Reply.”
