  Now begins the one-hundred-and-twenty-eighth sarga (chapter) of the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Tidings Dear to
  Bharata.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāghava, beholding Ayodhyā, began to reflect. Rāma, whose heart ever
  sought what is dear, and who desired to bring joy to his beloved ones,
  thereupon advanced with swift prowess.
'2': >-
  Having thus reflected, the wise and radiant one cast his gaze upon the Vānara
  hosts, and spoke to Hanūmān, the foremost among the leaping warriors.
'3': >-
  “Go quickly to Ayodhyā, O best of monkeys, and learn at once whether the
  people in the king’s palace are well and at ease.
'4': >-
  “Reaching Śṛṅgaverapura, tell Guha—lord of the Niṣādas, who moves fearlessly
  in the deep forest—my words asking after his welfare.
'5': >-
  “When he hears that I am well, free from illness, and without fever, Guha will
  be pleased—for he is my friend, as dear to me as my very self.
'6': >-
  “That pleased Guha, chief of the Niṣādas, will also inform you of the route to
  Ayodhyā and of Bharata’s present condition and doings.
'7': >-
  “And Bharata too you must address on my behalf, asking after his welfare. Tell
  him that I have accomplished my purpose—together with my wife and with
  Lakṣmaṇa.
'8': >-
  “Relate also the abduction of Vaidehī by the mighty Rāvaṇa, my alliance and
  converse with Sugrīva, and the slaying of Vāli in battle.
'9': >-
  “Tell him of the search for Maithilī, and how she was discovered by you—after
  you had leapt across the vast ocean, lord of rivers, inexhaustible.
'10': >-
  “Describe our advance to the sea and the sight of the ocean; how the bridge
  was caused to be built; and how Rāvaṇa was slain.
'11': >-
  “Speak of the boons bestowed by Mahendra, by Brahmā, and by Varuṇa; of the
  grace of the great god (Mahādeva); and of my reunion with my father.
'12': >-
  “And, O gentle one, report to Bharata that I am approaching—together with the
  king of the rākṣasas (now subdued), and with the lord of the monkeys.
'13': >-
  “Having conquered the hosts of foes, and having attained unsurpassed fame,
  Rāma is coming—his ends fulfilled—together with mighty friends.
'14': >-
  “When he hears this, what manner Bharata then assumes must be understood by
  you; and you must also learn everything in his heart toward me.
'15': >-
  “All tidings must be ascertained—the signs of Bharata’s inner feeling—truly,
  by the color of his face, by his look, and by his manner of speech.
'16': >-
  “For who, indeed, would not have his mind drawn to the ancestral and
  hereditary kingdom—abounding in every desired thing, thronged with elephants,
  horses, and chariots?
'17': >-
  “By the force of association with sovereignty, the illustrious Bharata might
  of himself become one who seeks the kingdom. Let Raghunandana rule the whole
  earth in its entirety.
'18': >-
  “Therefore, O Vānara, having discerned his intent and his resolve, you must
  return quickly—while we have not yet gone far.”
'19': >-
  Thus instructed in every detail, Hanūmān, son of Māruta, assuming a human
  form, set out swiftly for Ayodhyā.
'20': >-
  Then Hanūmān, son of Māruta, sprang up with speed—like Garuḍa in rapid flight,
  when he seeks to seize the best of serpents.
'21': >-
  Leaping over the path of the Fathers (the celestial way), and passing the
  auspicious abode of the lord of birds, he went beyond the dreadful confluence
  of the Gaṅgā and Yamunā.
'22': >-
  Reaching Śṛṅgaverapura, the mighty one came to Guha; and rejoicing, Hanūmān
  spoke to him in auspicious words:
'23': >-
  “Your friend, the Kakutstha, Rāma of true valor—together with Sītā and with
  Saumitrī—sends word to you, asking after your welfare.”
'24': >-
  “After he has spent this night, the fifth, in accordance with the sage’s word,
  and with Bharadvāja’s permission, you shall see Rāghava here itself.”
'25': >-
  Having spoken thus, the greatly radiant one, his hairs standing on end with
  delight, sprang up again with mighty speed—the swift one, without hesitation.
'26': >-
  He beheld Rāma-tīrtha, and the river Vālukinī; and also Varūthī, Gomati, and
  the dreadful Śāla forest.
'27': >-
  He saw also many-thousandfold multitudes of people, and prosperous districts;
  and having traversed a long road, that elephant among monkeys hurried on.
'28': >-
  He reached trees in full bloom near Nandigrāma—like the trees in the garden of
  the lord of gods, as in Citraratha’s grove.
'29': >-
  And within a krośa of Ayodhyā he saw one clad in bark-garments, dark
  antelope-skin, and rags—amid women, with sons and grandsons, delighting and
  adorned.
'30': >-
  He beheld Bharata, sorrowful, emaciated, living like an ascetic; with matted
  hair, his limbs smeared with grime, worn down by the calamity that had
  befallen his brother.
'31': >-
  He saw him eating fruits and roots, self-controlled and restrained—an
  anchorite who walked in dharma—with a lofty mass of matted locks, clad in bark
  and antelope-skin.
'32': >-
  Ever disciplined, his self refined by contemplation, possessing a radiance
  like that of a brahmarṣi—he ruled the earth, setting before him the sandals
  (pādukās) of Rāma.
'33': >-
  He was the protector of the people of the four varṇas from fear on every side,
  attended by ministers and by pure priests.
'34': >-
  He was surrounded also by chiefs of the army and by companions wearing ochre
  garments; for the citizens, devoted to righteousness, did not consent to let
  that prince—clad in bark and black antelope-skin—enjoy royal pleasures.
'35': >-
  They revered him, the knower of dharma, like dharma itself—like another bond
  of the body (life itself), as it were.
'36': >-
  Then Hanūmān, son of Māruta, with hands joined, spoke these words to him—(to
  Bharata) dwelling in Daṇḍaka forest, whom you mourn for, the Kakutstha,
  wearing bark and matted locks:
'37': >-
  “He has sent word to you, asking after your welfare. I tell you glad tidings,
  O lord—cast away this exceedingly dreadful grief.
'38': >-
  “At this very moment you shall be united with your brother Rāma. Having slain
  Rāvaṇa and regained Maithilī,
'39': >-
  “Rāma comes—his purpose fulfilled—together with mighty friends. And Lakṣmaṇa
  of great splendor, and glorious Vaidehī—Sītā, whole and unharmed with Rāma,
  like Śacī with Mahendra.”
'40': >-
  Thus addressed by Hanūmān, Bharata, son of Kaikeyī, suddenly fell down;
  overjoyed, he was overcome by a swoon born of rapture.
'41': >-
  Then, after a short while, rising and regaining composure, Bharata of the
  Raghu line spoke thus to Hanūmān, the speaker of pleasing words:
'42': >-
  With a heart full of gladness, Bharata embraced the monkey in excitement, and
  the illustrious one drenched him with copious tears.
'43': >-
  “Whether you are a god or a man, you have come here out of compassion. For
  your auspicious tidings, O gentle one, I shall grant you a dear reward as you
  speak what is dear.”
'44': >-
  “A hundred thousand cows, and more than a hundred villages; wives of noble
  conduct wearing earrings; and sixteen maidens—”
'45': >-
  “Golden-hued women with beautiful noses and thighs, with faces gentle as the
  moon; endowed with all ornaments, and blessed with prosperity and noble
  lineage.”
'46': >-
  Hearing of Rāma’s coming, the prince was thrilled by the wondrous,
  incomparable report of the foremost of monkeys. Filled with delight and
  longing to behold Rāma, he again spoke these words in joy.
'47': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-twenty-eighth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the
  venerable, illustrious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The
  Tidings Dear to Bharata.”
