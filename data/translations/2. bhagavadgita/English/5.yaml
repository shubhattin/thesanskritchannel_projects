'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (Paramātman).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': 'Now, the Fifth Chapter: The Yoga of Renunciation (Saṁnyāsa-yoga).'
'3': 'Arjuna said:'
'4': >-
  Renunciation of actions, O Kṛṣṇa, You praise, and again You praise yoga (the
  discipline of action). Tell me decisively which one of these two is truly the
  better (the highest good).
'5': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'6': >-
  Renunciation (saṁnyāsa) and the yoga of action (karma-yoga) are both means
  that lead to the supreme good; but of the two, the yoga of action is superior
  to mere renunciation of works.
'7': >-
  He should be known as a perpetual renunciate who neither hates nor desires;
  for, free from the pairs of opposites, O mighty-armed one, he is easily
  liberated from bondage.
'8': >-
  The childish, not the wise, speak of Sāṅkhya (the path of
  knowledge/renunciation) and yoga (the path of disciplined action) as
  different. He who is properly established even in one attains the fruit of
  both.
'9': >-
  The state that is attained by the followers of Sāṅkhya is also reached by the
  followers of yoga. He who sees Sāṅkhya and yoga as one—he truly sees.
'10': >-
  But renunciation, O mighty-armed one, is hard to attain without yoga
  (disciplined action); the sage who is united with yoga reaches Brahman before
  long.
'11': >-
  United with yoga, purified in mind, self-controlled, with the senses
  conquered, one whose self has become the self of all beings—though acting, he
  is not tainted.
'12': >-
  The one who is united (with yoga), who knows the truth, should think, “I do
  nothing at all,” even while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating,
  walking, sleeping, and breathing.
'13': >-
  Speaking, letting go, grasping, opening the eyes and closing them—holding
  firmly that “the senses move among the objects of the senses.”
'14': >-
  He who performs actions, placing them in Brahman and abandoning attachment, is
  not stained by sin—just as a lotus leaf is untouched by water.
'15': >-
  With body, mind, and intellect, and even with the senses alone, yogins perform
  action, abandoning attachment, for the purification of the self.
'16': >-
  One who is united (with yoga), having abandoned the fruit of action, attains
  steadfast peace; but the one who is not united, driven by desire, attached to
  the fruit, becomes bound.
'17': >-
  Renouncing all actions by the mind, the self-controlled embodied being rests
  happily in the city of nine gates, neither acting nor causing action.
'18': >-
  The Lord does not create for the world either agency (the sense of doership)
  or actions, nor the connection with the fruits of actions; rather, one’s own
  nature (svabhāva) proceeds (and sets all this in motion).
'19': >-
  The all-pervading Lord takes on neither the sin nor even the merit of anyone.
  Knowledge is veiled by ignorance; thereby beings are deluded.
'20': >-
  But for those whose ignorance has been destroyed by knowledge of the Self,
  that knowledge—like the sun—reveals the Supreme (Reality).
'21': >-
  Those whose intellect is That, whose self is That, who are established in
  That, who have That as their supreme goal—having their impurities removed by
  knowledge, they go to the state of no return.
'22': >-
  In a learned and humble brāhmaṇa, in a cow, in an elephant, and also in a dog
  and in one who eats dog’s flesh—wise ones see with equal vision.
'23': >-
  Here itself, creation (rebirth) is conquered by those whose mind is
  established in equality; for Brahman is flawless and equal—therefore they are
  established in Brahman.
'24': >-
  Let him not rejoice upon obtaining what is pleasant, nor be distressed upon
  obtaining what is unpleasant. With steady understanding, undeluded, the knower
  of Brahman stands established in Brahman.
'25': >-
  With the self unattached to external contacts, he finds the happiness that is
  in the Self. United with Brahman through yoga, he enjoys imperishable bliss.
'26': >-
  For the enjoyments that are born of contact are indeed sources of sorrow; they
  have a beginning and an end, O son of Kuntī—therefore the wise do not delight
  in them.
'27': >-
  He who is able, even here (in this life), to endure—before the body is cast
  off—the impulse born of desire and anger, that man is united (with yoga); that
  man is happy.
'28': >-
  He who is happy within, who delights within, and who has his light within—such
  a yogin, having become Brahman, attains Brahman-nirvāṇa (extinction in
  Brahman, final peace).
'29': >-
  The seers attain Brahman-nirvāṇa—those whose impurities are exhausted, whose
  doubts are cut asunder, who are self-controlled, and who delight in the
  welfare of all beings.
'30': >-
  For the ascetics who are free from desire and anger, who have controlled their
  minds, who have realized the Self—Brahman-nirvāṇa exists all around (is
  ever-present) for them.
'31': >-
  Having made the external contacts wholly outside, and having fixed the gaze
  between the eyebrows, and having made the inhalation and exhalation equal,
  moving within the nostrils,
'32': >-
  The sage who has controlled senses, mind, and intellect, who is devoted to
  liberation as his highest aim—having cast off desire, fear, and anger—he is
  ever liberated indeed.
'33': >-
  Knowing Me as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, the great Lord of all
  the worlds, and the well-wisher of all beings, he attains peace.
'34': >-
  Om Tat Sat—Thus in the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, among the Upaniṣads, in the
  science of Brahman, in the scripture of yoga, in the dialogue between Śrī
  Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, ends the fifth chapter, entitled “The Yoga of Renunciation.”
