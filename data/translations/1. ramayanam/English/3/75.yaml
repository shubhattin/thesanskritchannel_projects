  Now begins the seventy-fifth chapter, named “The Vision of Pampā,” in the
  Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  When that Śabarī had departed to heaven by her own spiritual radiance,
  Rāghava, together with his brother Lakṣmaṇa, began to reflect.
'2': >-
  Having reflected upon that mighty power of those great-souled ascetics,
  righteous Rāghava then spoke to Lakṣmaṇa—single-minded and ever intent on what
  is beneficial.
'3': >-
  “Gentle one, I have seen the hermitage of the self-controlled—most
  wondrous—where deer and tigers were at peace, and which was frequented by
  birds of many kinds.
'4': >-
  “And, O Lakṣmaṇa, at the sacred fords of the seven seas, ablutions have been
  duly performed according to prescribed rite, and the Pitṛs also have been
  satisfied with offerings.
'5': >-
  “The inauspiciousness that beset us has vanished; auspicious fortune has come
  near. Therefore, O Lakṣmaṇa, my heart is now greatly gladdened.
'6': >-
  “In my heart, O tiger among men, some good omen will manifest. Come then—let
  us go to that Pampā, lovely to behold.
'7': >-
  “Not far from there the mountain Ṛṣyamūka is clearly seen—on which dwells the
  righteous Sugrīva, son of Sūrya, the radiant one.
'8': >-
  “Ever terrified of Vāli out of fear, he stays there with four monkeys. I
  hasten to see that Sugrīva, the bull among monkeys.
'9': >-
  “For the work that depends upon him is the search for Sītā.” As the hero spoke
  thus, Saumitri replied to him.
'10': >-
  “Let us go there quickly; my mind too is eager.” Then that lord of men,
  departing from that hermitage,
'11': >-
  came thereafter to Pampā with Lakṣmaṇa, gazing all around at great trees
  spread wide, laden with blossoms.
'12': >-
  That vast forest resounded with calls—of koyasṭis, arjuna-birds, śatapatras,
  kīrakas, and many other birds besides.
'13': >-
  Beholding various trees and diverse lakes, Rāma—tormented by longing—went on
  to that supreme lotus-lake.
'14': >-
  Having reached it, Rāma from a distance saw the water-bearing stream, and
  entered the lake called Mataṅga-sarasa.
'15': >-
  There the two Rāghavas proceeded—unagitated and composed; but Rāma, son of
  Daśaratha, was overcome by grief.
'16': >-
  He entered that charming lotus-thicket, covered over with lotuses, made
  splendid by tilaka-trees, aśokas, puṃnāgas, bakulas, and uddālakas.
'17': >-
  It was crowded with delightful groves; its waters were pressed and stirred by
  lotuses; its water was crystal-clear; and its shores were spread with smooth
  sand.
'18': >-
  It was filled with fish and tortoises, beautified by trees standing on the
  banks, joined as though with companions, and entwined all about with creeping
  vines.
'19': >-
  It was frequented by kiṃnaras, serpents, gandharvas, yakṣas, and rākṣasas;
  strewn with many kinds of trees and climbers; an auspicious treasury of cool
  waters.
'20': >-
  It appeared coppery with padma and saugandhika lotuses; white with circles of
  kumudas; blue with blossoming kuvalayas—many-hued, like a fine garment.
'21': >-
  Abounding in aravindas and utpalas, rich with saugandhika lotuses, accompanied
  by groves red with flowers, and filled with the cries and calls of peacocks,
'22': >-
  Beholding that Pampā, Rāma, together with Saumitri, began to lament—Rāma, son
  of Daśaratha, radiant with splendor.
'23': >-
  “Adorned with tilaka-trees and bījapūras, with banyans and white-barked trees,
  and with karavīras in bloom, and with puṃnāgas richly flowered;
'24': >-
  “with thickets of mālatī and kunda, with bhaṇḍīras and niculas; with aśokas,
  saptaparṇas, katakas, and ati-muktakas;
'25': >-
  “and with other trees of many kinds—this place is beautified like a fair
  maiden. And upon its bank stands the mountain spoken of earlier, adorned with
  ores and minerals.
'26': >-
  “It is famed as Ṛṣyamūka, with trees blossoming in variegated flowers. There
  dwells a son of that great-souled one named Ṛkṣaraja—a monkey,
'27': >-
  “of great prowess, renowned as Sugrīva. Go to Sugrīva, the lord of monkeys, O
  best of men.
'28': >-
  Thus did he, whose valor is true, speak again to Lakṣmaṇa: “How, O Lakṣmaṇa,
  can I live without Sītā?”
'29': >-
  Having spoken thus, afflicted by the torment of love, with his mind fixed on
  none else, he addressed Lakṣmaṇa and entered the lotus-filled Pampā, most
  delightful—uttering his supreme sorrow.
'30': >-
  Going on step by step, and looking about upon the forest, he beheld Pampā,
  fair to see, whose waters were thronged with birds of many and diverse kinds;
  and Rāma entered it together with Lakṣmaṇa.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-fifth chapter, named “The Vision of Pampā,” in the
  Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
