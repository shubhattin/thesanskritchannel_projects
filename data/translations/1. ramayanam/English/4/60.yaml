  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, begins the sixtieth
  chapter, called “The narration of Sampāti’s former history.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, having offered him water and after he had bathed, the leaders of
  the monkey-troops sat down on a delightful mountain, surrounding that vulture
  on every side.
'2': >-
  With Aṅgada seated near him and encircled by all those monkeys, Sampāti—his
  confidence restored—once more spoke, his heart gladdened with joy.
'3': >-
  “Let the monkeys listen to me in silence, with minds gathered into one-pointed
  attention. I shall declare the truth, as I know it, concerning Maithilī.”
'4': >-
  “Formerly, O sinless one, I fell upon the summit of this Vindhya mountain—my
  limbs oppressed by the sun’s heat, scorched by the rays of the sun.”
'5': >-
  “Then, after six nights, I regained consciousness; helpless, as though
  bewildered, I looked in all directions, yet I could recognize nothing at all.”
'6': >-
  “After that, by surveying oceans, mountains, all rivers, lakes, forests, and
  regions, understanding gradually returned to me.”
'7': >-
  “This Vindhya—filled with delighted flocks of birds, possessed of caves,
  hollows, and peaks—standing on the shore of the southern sea: thus I
  determined with certainty.”
'8': >-
  “Here there was also a holy hermitage, honored even by the gods, in which a
  sage named Niśākara dwelt, practicing stern austerities.”
'9': >-
  “For eight thousand years I lived on this mountain with that righteous sage;
  and when Niśākara departed to heaven,”
'10': >-
  “—having then descended with difficulty from the Vindhya’s heights, over
  rugged ground, slowly and painfully—I returned again to the earth bristling
  with sharp kuśa-grass.”
'11': >-
  “I came in great distress, desiring to see that sage; for he had been known
  well to me many times, and likewise to Jatāyu.”
'12': >-
  “Near the precincts of that sage’s hermitage, fragrant winds blew; no tree was
  seen there that was without blossoms or without fruit.”
'13': >-
  “Approaching that holy hermitage, I took shelter at the root of a tree,
  waiting—longing to behold the venerable Niśākara.”
'14': >-
  “Then, from afar, I saw the sage, blazing with splendor—after performing his
  ablutions—unassailable, returning and facing north.”
'15': >-
  “Bears, deer, tigers, lions, and various creeping creatures surrounded him and
  drew near, like living beings approaching a giver of gifts.”
'16': >-
  “But once those creatures recognized that the sage had arrived, they went
  away—just as, when a king enters, the entire host with its ministers and
  forces withdraw within.”
'17': >-
  “The sage, on seeing me, was pleased and again entered the hermitage; then,
  after remaining only a moment, he came out and asked me the reason (of my
  condition).”
'18': >-
  “‘Gentle one, seeing this loss and not understanding it—these wings of yours
  are burned by fire; and the very life in your body as well (seems
  afflicted).’”
'19': >-
  “‘Two vultures I have seen before, equal to the Wind-god in speed—kings among
  vultures, brothers, able to assume forms at will.’”
'20': >-
  “‘You are the elder, Sampāti; Jatāyu is your younger brother. Assuming human
  form, take hold of my feet.’”
'21': >-
  “‘What is the origin of this affliction of yours? How did your wings fall? By
  whom was this punishment inflicted? Tell me everything, as I ask you.’”
'22': >-
  Thus ends the sixtieth chapter of the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, entitled “The narration of Sampāti’s former
  history.”
