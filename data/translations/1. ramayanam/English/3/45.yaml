  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-fifth chapter named “Sītā’s Harsh Speech (Sītāpāruṣyam).”
'1': >-
  But Sītā, recognizing in the forest that anguished cry to be like that of her
  husband, said to Lakṣmaṇa: “Go—find out about Rāghava.”
'2': >-
  “My life and heart do not remain steady in their place; I have clearly heard a
  terribly distressing cry, the cry of one who is in utmost anguish.”
'3': >-
  “You ought to save your brother who is wailing in the forest; run quickly to
  that brother who seeks refuge.”
'4': >-
  Though thus spoken to, he did not go, for he was acting according to his
  brother’s command—like a mighty bull among cows fallen under the power of
  lions.”
'5': >-
  Then the daughter of Janaka, shaken with agitation, spoke to him there: “O
  Saumitrī, under the guise of a friend, you are like an enemy to your brother.”
'6': >-
  “You do not go to your brother in such a situation. O Lakṣmaṇa, you desire
  Rāma to perish for my sake!”
'7': >-
  “Surely, out of greed for me you do not follow Rāghava. I think calamity is
  dear to you; you have no affection for your brother.”
'8': >-
  “Therefore you stand here confidently, not seeing that great, radiant one.
  What doubt could there be for me here, when he is in danger?”
'9': >-
  “What is to be done by me, staying here, for you have come as the chief
  (protector)?”—Thus spoke Vaidehī, overcome with tears and grief.
'10': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa, alarmed, replied to Sītā—like a doe—(saying): “By serpents, asuras,
  gandharvas, gods, dānavas, and rākṣasas—”
'11': >-
  “—your husband, O Vaidehī, cannot be conquered—there is no doubt. O देवी,
  among gods and men, among gandharvas and birds—”
'12': >-
  “—among rākṣasas, piśācas, kinnaras, and beasts, and even among dreadful
  dānavas, O fair one, there exists none—”
'13': >-
  “—who could fight Rāma in battle, he who is like Vāsava (Indra). Rāma is
  invincible in combat; you ought not speak thus.”
'14': >-
  “Nor am I able to leave you in this forest without Rāghava. His might is
  irresistible even to the mighty who possess great strength.”
'15': >-
  “Let your heart be at ease—though the three worlds, united with their lords
  and even with the Maruts, were to rise (against him). Abandon your torment.”
'16': >-
  “Your husband will return quickly, having slain that best of deer. That cry is
  not truly his voice; it is not any divine being either.”
'17': >-
  “It is the illusory trick, like a gandharva-city, belonging to that rākṣasa. O
  Vaidehī, you have been entrusted to me—entrusted by the great-souled one.”
'18': >-
  “O fair-hipped lady, I do not consent to abandon you here, you who have been
  entrusted by Rāma. O auspicious one, we have made enmity with these
  night-rangers.”
'19': >-
  “At the slaying of Khara, O lady, with regard to the destruction at
  Jana-sthāna, various rākṣasas utter many words in the great forest.”
'20': >-
  “O Vaidehī, you ought not to think of (their) sport as violence (against
  Rāma).” But though thus addressed by Lakṣmaṇa, she became enraged, her eyes
  red with anger.
'21': >-
  She spoke harsh words to Lakṣmaṇa, the speaker of truth: “You ignoble one,
  beginning cruelty without compassion; you pitiless man, the dust of your
  lineage!”
'22': >-
  “I believe the great calamity that has befallen Rāma is dear to you. Seeing
  Rāma’s calamity, you speak these things!”
'23': >-
  “It is not at all surprising, Lakṣmaṇa, if sin should occur among rivals. In
  cruel men like you, who always move about in concealment, (such sin is
  expected).”
'24': >-
  “You are utterly wicked—following Rāma alone into the forest, alone with him;
  concealed for my sake—sent perhaps by Bharata!”
'25': >-
  “That will not succeed, O Saumitrī—neither for you nor for Bharata. For how
  could I, taking shelter of my husband, desire another man—”
'26': >-
  “—that dark-hued one like a blue lotus, Rāma of lotus-like eyes? Before you, O
  Saumitrī, I would surely give up my life.”
'27': >-
  “Without Rāma I cannot live even for a moment upon the earth.” Thus spoken by
  Sītā were those harsh words that made the hair stand on end.
'28': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, with joined palms, self-controlled, said to Sītā: “I do not
  have the heart to speak an answer; you are my deity.”
'29': >-
  “Yet a word that is improper is not surprising in women, O Maithilī. This is
  the nature of women, seen in these worlds.”
'30': >-
  “Women are fickle, loosened from dharma, sharp, and makers of division. O
  Vaidehī, daughter of Janaka, I cannot endure such words.”
'31': >-
  “Let all the forest-dwellers who are witnesses hear my words—like heated iron
  arrows between both my ears as I listen (to your speech).”
'32': >-
  “Though I am one who speaks according to justice, I am addressed by you with
  harsh words. Fie on you today, who are headed for ruin, that you suspect me
  thus!”
'33': >-
  “Because you are a woman of flawed nature, steadfast in your elders’ command,
  I go where the Kākuṭstha is. May welfare be yours, O lovely-faced one.”
'34': >-
  “May all the deities of the forest protect you, O large-eyed lady. For
  dreadful omens are arising before me. May I, having returned, see you together
  with Rāma.”
'35': >-
  Though spoken to thus by Lakṣmaṇa, the daughter of Janaka, weeping, then
  replied with words, overwhelmed by fierce, streaming tears:
'36': >-
  “I shall enter the Godāvarī, O Lakṣmaṇa, bereft of Rāma; or else I shall bind
  myself (and die), or cast down my body in some perilous place.”
'37': >-
  “Or I shall drink sharp poison; or I shall enter fire. Never shall I touch any
  man other than Rāghava.”
'38': >-
  Hearing (this) from Lakṣmaṇa, Sītā, overcome with grief, weeping, in her
  sorrow struck her belly with both her hands.
'39': >-
  Seeing her, distressed in form, downcast and weeping—Sāumitrī looked upon that
  large-eyed lady and tried to console her; and Sītā said nothing at all about
  that brother of her husband.
'40': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, having saluted Sītā, with folded hands, bowing somewhat,
  repeatedly glancing at Maithilī, went—self-possessed—to the presence of Rāma.
'41': >-
  Thus ends the forty-fifth chapter, called “Sītā’s Harsh Speech
  (Sītāpāruṣyam),” in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the ancient, sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
