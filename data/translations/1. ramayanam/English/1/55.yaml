  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, the fifty-fifth sarga,
  called “Viśvāmitra’s Acquisition of the Science of Archery (Dhanurveda).”
'1': >-
  Then, seeing those armies thrown into confusion and rendered senseless by the
  power of the weapons, Viśvāmitra set his mind upon them; and Vasiṣṭha urged
  the wish-fulfilling cow Kāmadhuk to create (forces) by her yogic power.
'2': >-
  From her bellowing (“huṃkāra”) there arose Kāmbojas, radiant like the sun; and
  from her udders there then came forth Barbaras, bearing weapons in their
  hands.
'3': >-
  From her generative region were produced Yavanas; from her excremental region,
  those remembered as Śakas; from the pores of her skin came forth Mlecchas,
  along with Hārītas and Kirātas.
'4': >-
  By those (newly created warriors), all that host of Viśvāmitra was instantly
  cut down—O Raghunandana—together with its infantry, elephants, horses, and
  chariots.
'5': >-
  Seeing that army destroyed by the great-souled Vasiṣṭha, a hundred sons of
  Viśvāmitra—armed with weapons of many kinds—rushed forward.
'6': >-
  Furious, they charged at Vasiṣṭha, the best of those who recite sacred
  formulae; but with a mere bellow (“huṃkāra”) the great ṛṣi burned them all to
  ashes.
'7': >-
  Thus, along with their horses, chariots, and foot-soldiers, the sons of
  Viśvāmitra were reduced to ashes in a moment by the great-souled Vasiṣṭha.
'8': >-
  Seeing all of them destroyed—his entire strength laid waste—Viśvāmitra of
  great fame was then overwhelmed with shame and plunged into anxious
  reflection.
'9': >-
  Like the ocean become suddenly calm and without motion; like a serpent with
  its fangs broken; like the sun as though dimmed and reddened—he at once fell
  into lusterlessness.
'10': >-
  Having lost his sons and his forces, wretched, like a bird shorn of its wings,
  with all strength and ardor struck down, he fell into deep despondency.
'11': >-
  Appointing one son with the charge, “Protect the kingdom,” he then forsook the
  earth and, adhering to the kṣatriya code, entered the forest itself.
'12': >-
  Going to the side of Himavān, frequented by Kinnaras and serpents, that great
  ascetic performed austerities, seeking the grace of Mahādeva.
'13': >-
  After some time had passed, the Lord of the gods, the boon-bestowing One with
  the bull for his emblem, revealed himself to that great sage Viśvāmitra.
'14': >-
  “For what purpose do you practise austerities, O king? Tell me what you wish
  to say. I am the giver of boons; let that boon which you desire be declared.”
'15': >-
  Thus addressed by the god, Viśvāmitra, mighty in austerity, bowed low before
  Mahādeva and spoke these words:
'16': >-
  “If you are pleased, O Mahādeva, then grant me, O sinless Lord, the
  Dhanurveda—complete with its limbs and sub-limbs, together with its Upaniṣads
  and its secret teachings.”
'17': >-
  “And let all the divine weapons that exist among the gods, among the Dānavas,
  and among the great ṛṣis—indeed among Gandharvas, Yakṣas, and Rākṣasas—be made
  manifest to me, O sinless One.”
'18': >-
  “By your favor, O God of gods, let my desire be fulfilled.” “So be it,” said
  the Lord of the gods; and having spoken thus, he departed.
'19': >-
  Having obtained those weapons from the Lord of the gods, the mighty Viśvāmitra
  became possessed of immense pride; indeed, he was then filled to overflowing
  with arrogance.
'20': >-
  Growing in prowess like the ocean at the time of the full tide, he deemed
  Vasiṣṭha—the foremost of ṛṣis—already as good as slain, O Rāma.
'21': >-
  Then the king went to that hermitage-ground and discharged his weapons, by
  which that grove of austerities was burned up by the fiery splendor of the
  missiles.
'22': >-
  Seeing that weapon of the wise Viśvāmitra being set in motion and rising in
  force, the sages, terrified, fled in hundreds toward every direction.
'23': >-
  And the disciples of Vasiṣṭha, as well as the deer and the birds, fled in
  fear—terrified—by thousands, scattering toward various quarters.
'24': >-
  The hermitage-ground of the great-souled Vasiṣṭha became empty; for a moment
  it was utterly silent, resembling a lonely waste.
'25': >-
  While Vasiṣṭha repeatedly cried out, “Do not fear, do not fear,” (he
  declared:) “Today I shall destroy this descendant of Gādhi, as the Sun
  destroys the morning mist.”
'26': >-
  Having spoken thus, Vasiṣṭha of great splendor, the foremost of
  mantra-chanters, then addressed Viśvāmitra with these angry words:
'27': >-
  “Because you have laid waste this hermitage that had long flourished, you are
  of wicked conduct; and since you are deluded, you shall not attain success (in
  your purpose).”
'28': >-
  Having said this, exceedingly enraged, he swiftly lifted up his staff—like
  smokeless fire at the end of time, like another very rod of Yama.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fifth sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the Ādikāvya, entitled “Viśvāmitra’s Acquisition of the Science of Archery
  (Dhanurveda).”
