  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-second chapter, named “The Commencement of the Battle.”
'1': >-
  Then those rākṣasas went there to Rāvaṇa’s palace and reported: “The city has
  been besieged by Rāma together with the vānaras.”
'2': >-
  Hearing that the city had been blocked, the Night-ranger, anger having arisen
  in him, doubled the defensive arrangements and also ascended his palace-tower.
'3': >-
  He beheld Laṅkā encircled—together with her mountains, forests, and groves—on
  every side by countless troops of monkeys, all eager for battle.
'4': >-
  Seeing the entire earth made, as it were, ‘monkey-like’ by all those vānaras,
  he became absorbed in anxious thought: “How indeed are these to be destroyed?”
'5': >-
  After thinking for a long time, and bracing himself with firmness, Rāvaṇa of
  long eyes looked upon Rāghava and upon the monkey-battalions.
'6': >-
  Rāghava, rejoicing with his army, advanced forward, and beheld
  Laṅkā—well-guarded and encompassed on all sides by rākṣasas.
'7': >-
  On seeing Laṅkā adorned with variegated banners and pennons, Daśaratha’s son
  at once turned his mind toward Sītā, his heart burning within.
'8': >-
  “Here, for my sake, that doe-eyed daughter of Janaka is being tormented—worn
  down by grief and anguish, emaciated, lying upon the bare ground.”
'9': >-
  Thus reflecting upon Vaidehī, oppressed, righteous-souled Rāma quickly
  commanded the vānaras to the destruction of the foes.
'10': >-
  When these words were spoken by Rāma of untiring deeds, the monkeys, eager for
  close combat, filled the quarters with lion-roars.
'11': >-
  “With mountain-peaks we shall crush this Laṅkā—or with our fists alone!”—thus
  did all the leaders of monkey-troops set their minds.
'12': >-
  Lifting up great crags and mighty peaks, and uprooting trees of many kinds,
  the leaders of monkey-bands stood ready.
'13': >-
  Before the eyes of the lord of rākṣasas, those divisions, in separate bodies,
  then mounted Laṅkā, intent on accomplishing what was dear to Rāghava.
'14': >-
  Those copper-faced, golden-hued warriors—having forsaken their lives for
  Rāma’s sake—assailed Laṅkā itself, fighting with sāl trees and
  mountain-masses.
'15': >-
  With trees, with mountain-tops, and with their fists, those monkeys smashed
  innumerable rampart-summits and shattered the gateways.
'16': >-
  Filling the moats—those basins of clear and pleasant water—with dust, with
  mountain-peaks, and with grass and wood, the vānaras pressed on.
'17': >-
  Then troop-leaders of a thousand bands, and troop-leaders of a crore of bands,
  and others leading hundreds of crores of bands, mounted Laṅkā at that time.
'18': >-
  The monkeys trampled down the golden gateways, and, battering the lofty
  gate-towers that seemed like the crests of Kailāsa, they broke them.
'19': >-
  Leaping and springing and roaring, the monkeys—resembling great
  elephants—rushed upon that Laṅkā.
'20': >-
  “Victory to mighty-armed Rāma! And to Lakṣmaṇa of great strength! Victory to
  King Sugrīva, protected by Rāghava!”
'21': >-
  Thus crying aloud and roaring, those monkeys—able to assume forms at will—ran
  toward Laṅkā’s ramparts.
'22': >-
  Vīrabāhu and Subāhu, and Nala and Panasa as well—those leaders of
  monkey-troops, pressing close, took position at the rampart; and in the
  meanwhile they made their camp and stationed the host.
'23': >-
  At the eastern gate stood the mighty Kumuda, surrounded by ten crores, covered
  over by monkeys who had conquered Kāśī.
'24': >-
  For his support also were stationed the monkey Praghāsa, and Panasa of great
  arms, encompassed by vānaras.
'25': >-
  Reaching the southern gate, the heroic monkey Śatabali stood there with
  strength, having encompassed it, surrounded by twenty crores.
'26': >-
  Sūṣeṇa—Tārā’s father, a powerful one—went to the western gate and stood there
  with strength, having encompassed it, surrounded by crores upon crores.
'27': >-
  Coming to the northern gate, Rāma together with Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa) stood
  there with strength, having encompassed it; and Sugrīva, lord of the monkeys,
  stood there as well.
'28': >-
  Golāṅgūla, of huge body, and Gavākṣa of dreadful aspect—of great prowess and
  surrounded by a crore—stood at Rāma’s side.
'29': >-
  Dhūmra, the destroyer of foes, among the bears of terrible wrath—of great
  prowess and surrounded by a crore—stood at Rāma’s side.
'30': >-
  Then Vibhīṣaṇa, fully armed, of great valor, mace in hand, surrounded by his
  disciplined counsellors, stood where the mighty one (Rāma) stood.
'31': >-
  Gaja, Gavākṣa, Gavaya, Śarabha, and Gandhamādana—running all around—protected
  the monkey-host.
'32': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, his heart overwhelmed with wrath, swiftly
  commanded the departure of all his armies.
'33': >-
  Hearing then that speech issued from Rāvaṇa’s mouth, the night-rangers
  suddenly raised a dreadful tumultuous cry.
'34': >-
  Then kettledrums with drum-heads pale as the moon were sounded on every side
  for the rākṣasas, struck upon their golden rims.
'35': >-
  And conches of mighty sound—by the hundred thousands—resounded, filled with
  the breath from the mouths of the exceedingly fierce rākṣasas.
'36': >-
  Those night-rangers, bearing conches, appeared of auspicious dark-blue
  hue—like clouds furnished with circles of lightning, and with cranes among
  them.
'37': >-
  Then the armies, delighted and urged on by Rāvaṇa, rushed forth—like the
  surging tides of the great ocean when it is filling at the proper time.
'38': >-
  Thereafter, the roar released by the monkey-army on every side filled the
  Malaya mountain, along with its slopes, ridges, and caves.
'39': >-
  The din of conches and kettledrums, and the lion-roars of the impetuous,
  resounded through earth and sky and the sea as well.
'40': >-
  Together with the trumpeting of elephants, and the neighing of horses, with
  the rumbling of chariot-wheels, and with the cries from the mouths of the
  rākṣasas—
'41': >-
  In that very interval a dreadful battle came to pass between the rākṣasas and
  the vānaras, like that which once was between the devas and the asuras.
'42': >-
  They struck down all the vānaras with blazing maces, with spears, tridents,
  and battle-axes, proclaiming their own prowess.
'43': >-
  So too the swift monkeys, of huge bodies, struck down those rākṣasas with
  trees and with mountain-peaks, and with their nails and teeth.
'44': >-
  A great cry arose: “Victory to King Sugrīva!”—and then, saying, “O King,
  victory, victory!” they proclaimed each his own name.
'45': >-
  But other terrible rākṣasas, stationed upon the ramparts, tore apart the
  monkeys who had come down to the ground, with javelins and with tridents.
'46': >-
  And the monkeys also, enraged—leaping up into the sky and descending to the
  ground—made the rākṣasas fall by the strength of their own arms.
'47': >-
  That clash became tumultuous, a mire of flesh and blood—an astonishing
  spectacle indeed—between rākṣasas and vānaras.
'48': >-
  Thus ends, in the venerable, sacred Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the First Poem, in
  the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the forty-second chapter, named “The Commencement of the
  Battle.”
