  Now, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Aranya-kanda, begins the sixtieth
  chapter, called “Rama’s Frenzy (Ramonmada).”
'1': >-
  As he went on in great haste, his left eye below (the lower eyelid) of the
  left side began to throb repeatedly; Rama also stumbled, and a trembling
  seized his limbs.
'2': >-
  Perceiving again and again those inauspicious portents, he spoke these words:
  “May it still be well with Sita!”
'3': >-
  Then, hurrying forward, longing to behold Sita, he went on; and seeing the
  dwelling-place empty, his mind became deeply disturbed.
'4': >-
  The delight of the Raghu line, as though in a sudden whirl, rushed about with
  speed, casting his glance all around, searching here and there for the site of
  the leaf-hut.
'5': >-
  Then he beheld the leaf-thatched cottage bereft of Sita—devoid of its former
  splendor, ruined—like a lotus-pond in winter, robbed of beauty.
'6': >-
  It seemed as though it were weeping with its trees, with its flowers, beasts,
  and birds all languid; bereft of auspiciousness, laid waste, and as though
  abandoned by the deities of the forest.
'7': >-
  Seeing the hermitage-site empty—its deer-skins and kusha grass scattered
  about, and its couch and seating disordered—he lamented again and again.
'8': >-
  “Has she been carried away, or has she died, or is she lost? Has she been
  devoured? Or is the timid one hiding somewhere, or has she taken refuge in the
  forest?”
'9': >-
  “Or has she gone to gather flowers, and again perhaps fruits? Or has she gone
  to a lotus-pond, or to the river to fetch water?”
'10': >-
  Yet though he searched with all effort, he did not find his beloved in the
  forest. His eyes reddened with grief, the illustrious one appeared like a
  madman.
'11': >-
  Running from tree to tree, and to the hills, and to rivers and streams, Rama
  wandered about lamenting, submerged in an ocean of grief and mire.
'12': >-
  “O Kadamba tree, have you by any chance seen my beloved, who is dear to the
  kadamba? If you know, tell me of Sita of auspicious face.”
'13': >-
  “O Bilva tree, if you have seen her—she who resembles tender, glossy shoots,
  clad in yellow silk, and with breasts like bilva fruits—declare it to me.”
'14': >-
  “Or, O Arjuna tree, tell me of that beloved one who is dear to the
  arjuna—Janaka’s slender daughter—whether she yet lives or not.”
'15': >-
  “O Kakubha tree—surely this kakubha knows that broad-hipped Maithili; for this
  lordly tree shines, laden with creepers, tender leaves, and blossoms.”
'16': >-
  “And you, O Tilaka tree—sung to by bees as you are, the foremost of
  trees—surely you know Tilaka’s beloved (Sita) clearly.”
'17': >-
  “O Ashoka, remover of sorrow! I am stricken in mind by grief—make me quickly
  ‘without sorrow’ by granting me the sight of my beloved.”
'18': >-
  “If you, O Tala tree, have seen her whose breasts are like ripe
  palm-fruits—tell me of that fair-hipped lady, if you have any compassion
  toward me.”
'19': >-
  “If you, O Jambu tree, have seen her—radiant like refined jambunada gold—if
  you know my beloved, tell me without hesitation.”
'20': >-
  “Ah, today you, O Karnikara, are in bloom and shine exceedingly; if you have
  seen my chaste beloved, dear to the karnikara, speak of her.”
'21': >-
  Approaching mango-trees and nipa trees, great salas, jackfruit trees, kuravas,
  dhavas, and pomegranates too, the greatly renowned Rama went from one to
  another, looking.
'22': >-
  And then he questioned bakula trees, punnaga trees, sandalwood trees, and
  ketaka plants; Rama, wandering in the forest, appeared like one distraught.
'23': >-
  “Or, O deer—do you know Maithili, she whose eyes are like a fawn’s? The
  beloved one, with glances like a doe’s, might be with the does.”
'24': >-
  “O elephant—if you have seen her whose thighs are like an elephant’s
  trunk—surely she is known to you; tell me, O best of elephants.”
'25': >-
  “O tiger—if you have seen my beloved Maithili of moonlike face—tell me freely;
  do not fear.”
'26': >-
  “Why do you run, my dear? Surely you have seen her, O lotus-eyed one. Why do
  you hide yourself among the trees and not answer me?”
'27': >-
  “Stay, stay, O fair-hipped one! Have you no pity for me? You are not overly
  given to jest—why do you slight me?”
'28': >-
  “O lovely-complexioned one, you are betrayed by your yellow silk; though you
  run, I have seen you. Stand, if there is any affection in you.”
'29': >-
  “No—surely she is not (thus hiding); or else the charming-smiling one has been
  harmed. Surely my distress is not such that I should deserve to be disregarded
  like this.”
'30': >-
  “Plainly, the young girl—my beloved, separated from me—has been devoured by
  flesh-eating rakshasas, after they divided all her limbs.”
'31': >-
  “Surely that face—with auspicious teeth and lips, a beautiful nose, and lovely
  earrings—moonlike in fullness—has been seized and has lost its radiance.”
'32': >-
  “Surely her auspicious, delicate neck, gleaming like the champaka flower and
  adorned with a necklace, has been eaten—even as the beloved one cried out.”
'33': >-
  “Surely those two arms, soft as tender shoots, flung about in terror—trembling
  at the fingertips—adorned with bracelets and armlets—have been devoured.”
'34': >-
  “My young beloved, separated from me, has been left for the rakshasas to
  eat—like one abandoned by a caravan—and though she had many kinsfolk, she has
  been devoured.”
'35': >-
  “Alas, Lakshmana, mighty-armed one! Do you see my beloved anywhere? Alas, my
  dear—where have you gone, gentle one? Alas, Sita!”—thus he cried again and
  again.
'36': >-
  Lamenting in this manner, Rama ran from forest to forest; at times he reeled
  about from speed, at times he staggered from sheer exertion.
'37': >-
  At times he appeared like one intoxicated, wholly intent on seeking his
  beloved. Restless and unsteady, he rushed through forests, along rivers, over
  mountains, to mountain-springs, and through groves with great speed.
'38': >-
  Then, going into that vast and mighty forest and searching all about with
  Maithili in mind, he, with hope unfulfilled, undertook once more the supreme
  toil of seeking his beloved.
'39': >-
  Thus ends the sixtieth chapter, called “Rama’s Frenzy,” in the Aranya-kanda of
  the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the Adi-kavya.
