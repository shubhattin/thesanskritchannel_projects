  Now begins the sixth sarga of Kishkindha-kanda in the holy Valmiki Ramayana,
  entitled “The Recognition of the Ornaments.”

  Then again, Sugriva—gladdened at heart—spoke to Raghava, the delight of the
  Raghus: “This foremost of ministers, Hanuman, will relate to you (the matter)
  in full.”
'2': >-
  “(He knows) for what purpose you, along with your brother Lakshmana, have come
  to this lonely forest and have been dwelling in the woods.”
'3': >-
  “Your consort, the Maithili, daughter of King Janaka, has been carried off by
  a rakshasa, and you have been separated from her—she lamenting—and so also the
  wise Lakshmana.”
'4': >-
  “Seeking an opportunity, that rakshasa slew the vulture Jatayu; and by him you
  were made to fall into the sorrow born of separation from your wife.”
'5': >-
  “From this sorrow born of separation from your wife you shall be released ere
  long. I shall bring her back—the lost one—like a Vedic hymn that had been
  misplaced.”
'6': >-
  “Whether she be abiding in Rasatala (the nether regions) or moving in the
  mid-heaven, I shall fetch her and restore your wife to you, O subduer of
  foes.”
'7': >-
  “Know this word of mine to be true, O Raghava: she cannot be harmed—nay, not
  even by the gods and asuras together, though Indra be at their head.”
'8': >-
  “Your wife, O mighty-armed one, is like food that has been laced with
  poison—(dangerous to seize and consume). Cast away your grief, O mighty-armed;
  I shall bring that beloved lady to you.”
'9': >-
  “By inference I know—there is no doubt—that she is Maithili. I myself saw her
  being borne away by a rakshasa of dreadful deeds.”
'10': >-
  “Crying out, ‘Rama, Rama!’ and ‘Lakshmana!’ in a broken, indistinct voice, she
  writhed upon Ravana’s lap like the bride of the lord of serpents (a
  naga-maiden) held captive.”
'11': >-
  “Seeing me stationed upon the face of the mountain—(as) the fifth
  (witness)—she cast down her upper cloth and her auspicious ornaments as well.”
'12': >-
  “We collected them, O Raghava, and kept them in safe keeping. I shall bring
  them; you ought to recognize them.”
'13': >-
  Then Rama said to Sugriva, who spoke pleasing words: “Bring them, friend,
  quickly. Why do you delay?”
'14': >-
  Thus addressed, Sugriva at once entered a deep, hidden cave of the mountain,
  eager to do what was pleasing to Raghava.
'15': >-
  Taking up the upper cloth and those ornaments, the monkey showed them to Rama,
  saying, “Behold this.”
'16': >-
  Then, taking the garment and the auspicious ornaments, (Rama) became with his
  sight obscured by tears—like the moon veiled by mist.
'17': >-
  Soiled by tears that welled up from his love for Sita, he cried, “Alas, my
  beloved!” and, casting away his composure, fell upon the ground.
'18': >-
  Placing again and again that spotless, excellent ornament upon his heart, he
  heaved deep sighs—like an enraged serpent dwelling in its hole.
'19': >-
  With the flow of his tears unbroken, and looking at Saumitra (Lakshmana) at
  his side, Rama began to lament piteously.
'20': >-
  “See, Lakshmana—this upper cloth, abandoned by Vaidehi while she was being
  carried off, and these ornaments too, dropped from her body onto the ground.”
'21': >-
  “On this grassy, firm earth, surely, while Sita was being borne away, this
  ornament was cast aside; indeed, such is its appearance.”
'22': >-
  Thus spoken to by Rama, Lakshmana replied: “I do not recognize the armlets; I
  do not recognize the earrings.”
'23': >-
  “But I recognize the anklets, from bowing daily at her feet.” Thereupon
  Raghava spoke this word to Sugriva:
'24': >-
  “Tell me, Sugriva—what region was she being carried toward, as seen by you—my
  life’s beloved, borne away by a rakshasa of dreadful form?”
'25': >-
  “Or where does that mighty rakshasa dwell, who has brought this great calamity
  upon me—on whose account I shall destroy all the rakshasas?”
'26': >-
  “By carrying off Maithili and by surely provoking my wrath, he has opened the
  gate of death for himself—unto the end of his own life.”
'27': >-
  “My dearest has been seized and borne away from the forest by that
  night-roamer who violated and distressed her. Declare to me today that enemy
  of mine at once, O lord of the monkeys—I shall take him to the presence of
  Yama (the Lord of Death).”
'28': >-
  Thus ends the sixth sarga of Kishkindha-kanda in the holy Valmiki Ramayana,
  the Adi-kavya, entitled “The Recognition of the Ornaments.”
