  Now begins the thirty-ninth sarga (chapter), named “The Gladdening of the
  Vānaras,” in the Uttarakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then those great-souled kings set forth, as though filled with exultation,
  making the earth shake with torrents of thousands of elephants and horses.
'2': >-
  For there were many akṣauhiṇīs of armies there, all prepared for Rāghava’s
  cause—many delighted kings with their forces and vehicles, assembled by
  Bharata’s command.
'3': >-
  And those rulers, endowed with the pride of strength, spoke: “We do not see
  Rāma and Rāvaṇa standing face to face before us in battle.”
'4': >-
  “In vain have we been brought afterward by Bharata; for the rākṣasas would
  quickly have been slain by the kings—of this there is no doubt.”
'5': >-
  “Protected by the might of Rāma’s arms and also by Lakṣmaṇa’s, let us fight in
  comfort on the farther shore of the ocean, with all fevered anxiety gone.”
'6': >-
  Speaking these and many other tales—by the thousand—those kings, rejoicing,
  went on, conversing of their own kingdoms.
'7': >-
  (They spoke of) their foremost realms—prosperous, gladdened, rich—abounding in
  wealth and grain, full and opulent.
'8': >-
  Having returned to their kingdoms as before, they then gave various gems, and,
  to fulfill what would be pleasing to Rāma, the kings presented offerings.
'9': >-
  They gave horses, vehicles, and jewels; and elephants fierce in rut; and
  choice sandalwood; and divine ornaments as well.
'10': >-
  They gave also mani-gems, pearls, and corals; maidservants endowed with
  beauty; various kinds of goats and sheep; and chariots of many sorts.
'11': >-
  Bharata and Lakṣmaṇa, and mighty-armed Śatrughna as well, taking those jewels,
  returned again to their own city.
'12': >-
  Reaching the delightful city of Ayodhyā, those best of men offered those
  wondrous treasures to Rāma.
'13': >-
  Having accepted all of it, Rāma, filled with delight, the great-souled one,
  gave (them) to King Sugrīva, who had accomplished his task.
'14': >-
  And Rāghava gave (a portion) to Vibhīṣaṇa, and likewise to others too—to the
  rākṣasas and to the vānaras, by whom, surrounding him, he had attained
  victory.
'15': >-
  All those mighty vānaras and rākṣasas bore upon their heads and upon their
  arms the jewels that Rāma had bestowed.
'16': >-
  And the king—the great chariot-warrior of the Ikṣvākus, mighty in
  valor—lifting Hanumān and also mighty-armed Aṅgada, placed them upon his lap.
'17': >-
  Rāma of lotus-petal eyes said this to Sugrīva: “This Aṅgada is your noble son,
  and the son of the Wind (Hanumān) is also a minister.”
'18': >-
  “Both, acting according to Sugrīva’s counsel and devoted also to my welfare,
  are worthy of manifold honor for your sake, O lord of the vānaras.”
'19': >-
  Having thus spoken, the greatly renowned (Rāma) removed ornaments from his own
  person, and he fastened those most precious adornments upon Aṅgada and
  Hanumān.
'20': >-
  Then Rāghava addressed the chiefs of the troops, the great heroes—Nīla, Nala,
  Kesarin, Kumuda, and Gandhamādana,
'21': >-
  Suṣeṇa, the heroic Panasa, and Mainda, and Dvivida as well; Jāmbavān, and
  Gavākṣa; and Vinata, and Dhūmra too;
'22': >-
  Vālīmukha, and Prajaṅgha; and Sannāda of great strength; and Darīmukha, and
  Dadhimukha; and Indrajānu, the leader of troops;
'23': >-
  With sweet and gentle speech—as though drinking them in with his eyes—(he
  said): “You are my friends, and my very body; you are like brothers.”
'24': >-
  “By you, O dwellers of the forest, I have been lifted out of calamity; and
  blessed is King Sugrīva, through you—foremost among friends.”
'25': >-
  Thus speaking, the bull among men gave them ornaments according to their
  worth; and exceedingly precious vajras (diamond-like jewels), and he embraced
  them.
'26': >-
  Those tawny-hued (vānaras), drinking fragrant meads, and eating well-prepared
  meats, as well as roots and fruits,
'27': >-
  —thus residing there—then a full month passed for them; yet they all deemed it
  as but a moment, through devotion to Rāma.
'28': >-
  Rāma too delighted in their company—together with those shape-shifting
  vānaras, and with the mighty rākṣasas, and with the bears of great strength as
  well.
'29': >-
  Thus for them a second month passed happily, in the season of winter—on all
  sides for the gladdened vānaras and the rākṣasas.
'30': >-
  In the delightful city of the Ikṣvākus, while they remained in supreme joy
  through acts that brought delight to Rāma, time passed for them pleasantly.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-ninth sarga, named “The Gladdening of the Vānaras,” in
  the Uttarakāṇḍa of the venerable, holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
