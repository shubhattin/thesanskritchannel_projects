  Now begins, in the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the tenth
  canto named “The Boons Granted to Rāvaṇa and Others.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma spoke to the sage: “How did your brothers dwell in the forest? And
  what kind of austerities did those mighty ones perform then, O Brahman?”
'2': >-
  Thereupon Agastya, with his mind well pleased, spoke to Rāma: “There, your
  brothers entered upon those various modes of righteous observances and
  disciplines.”
'3': >-
  Then Kumbhakarṇa, devoted and ever stationed upon the path of dharma,
  performed austerities in the summer season, standing amidst five fires all
  around.
'4': >-
  In the rainy season he observed the heroic posture (vīrāsana), drenched by
  clouds and water; and ever in the cold season he took refuge in the midst of
  water.
'5': >-
  Thus ten thousand years passed over him, as he strove for dharma and remained
  steadfast on the true and good path.
'6': >-
  But Vibhīṣaṇa, righteous-souled, ever devoted to dharma and pure, stood for
  five thousand years upon one foot alone.
'7': >-
  When his observance was completed, the hosts of Apsarases danced; a rain of
  flowers fell; and the deities too were stirred with amazement.
'8': >-
  For five thousand years he followed the sun (with unwavering discipline); and
  he stood with head downward and arms raised, his mind upheld by sacred study
  (svādhyāya).
'9': >-
  Thus, for Vibhīṣaṇa—self-restrained, as though dwelling in Nandana, the
  celestial grove—ten thousand years of strict observance passed by.
'10': >-
  But the ten-faced one (Rāvaṇa), for ten thousand years, remained without food;
  and at the completion of each thousand years he offered one of his heads into
  the fire.
'11': >-
  Thus nine thousand years passed over him; and nine of his heads, indeed, had
  entered the blazing fire as oblations.
'12': >-
  Then, in the tenth thousand-year period, when the ten-necked one desired to
  cut off the tenth head, the Grandsire (Brahmā) arrived there.
'13': >-
  The Grandsire, highly pleased and attended by the gods, addressed him: “O
  Ten-necked one, I am satisfied with you.”
'14': >-
  “Quickly choose, O knower of dharma, the boon that you desire. What wish of
  yours shall I fulfill today? Your toil shall not be in vain.”
'15': >-
  Then the ten-necked one spoke, his inner self exceedingly delighted; bowing
  his head to the god, with words choked by joy, he said:
'16': >-
  “O Blessed Lord, for embodied beings there is ever no fear other than death;
  there is no enemy equal to Death. I choose immortality.”
'17': >-
  Thus addressed, Brahmā then said to the ten-necked one: “For you there cannot
  be complete immortality. Choose some other boon from me.”
'18': >-
  When this was said, O Rāma, by Brahmā, the creator of the worlds, the
  ten-necked one, with joined palms, spoke these words before him:
'19': >-
  “O Lord of creatures, may I be invulnerable to Suparṇas (Garuḍas), Nāgas,
  Yakṣas, Daityas, Dānavas, and Rākṣasas—and, O Eternal One, to the gods as
  well.”
'20': >-
  “For I have no concern regarding other beings, O you who are worshiped by the
  immortals. Creatures such as men and the like—I deem them as no more than
  blades of grass.”
'21': >-
  Thus spoken to by the rākṣasa Ten-neck, the righteous-souled Grandsire,
  together with the gods, replied with these words:
'22': >-
  “So shall it be, just as you have spoken, O foremost of Rākṣasas.” Having thus
  spoken to that ten-necked one, O Rāma, the Grandsire (continued):
'23': >-
  “Hear also another boon—auspicious—of mine, for I am pleased with you here.
  Those heads which you previously offered into the fire, O sinless one,”
'24': >-
  “shall come to be again for you exactly as before, O Rākṣasa. I bestow on you,
  gentle one, yet another boon that is hard to overcome.”
'25': >-
  “Whatever form you desire at will, according to your mind’s wish, shall indeed
  come to pass for you without doubt—through my boon, O Rākṣasa.”
'26': >-
  When the Grandsire had thus spoken to the ten-necked rākṣasa, the heads that
  had been offered into the fire rose again, indeed, as before.
'27': >-
  Having thus addressed that ten-necked one, O Rāma, the Grandsire, the Father
  of the worlds, then spoke these words to Vibhīṣaṇa:
'28': >-
  “Vibhīṣaṇa, dear child—endowed with a mind aligned with dharma— I am pleased
  with you, O righteous one. Choose a boon, O you of excellent vows.”
'29': >-
  Then Vibhīṣaṇa, righteous-souled, spoke with joined palms—endowed always with
  all virtues, like the moon surrounded by its rays:
'30': >-
  “O Blessed Lord, I am fulfilled, since the Teacher of the worlds himself has
  become pleased. Yet, if a boon is to be given to me by you in your
  satisfaction, hear my request, O you of excellent vows.”
'31': >-
  “Even when I fall into the utmost calamity, may my understanding remain fixed
  in dharma; and may the unlearned Brahmā-weapon (Brahmāstra) become clear and
  manifest to me, O Blessed One.”
'32': >-
  “Whatever understanding arises in me, in whatever āśramas and conditions of
  life, may that understanding be righteous; and may I protect and uphold that
  very dharma.”
'33': >-
  “This is my highest and most noble boon; this, indeed, is my supreme desire.
  For to those devoted to dharma, nothing whatsoever is difficult to obtain in
  the world.”
'34': >-
  Again, the Lord of creatures (Brahmā), pleased, said to Vibhīṣaṇa: “As you are
  righteous, dear child, so shall this indeed come to be.”
'35': >-
  “Since you—though born in the rākṣasa womb, O destroyer of foes—do not develop
  a mind inclined to unrighteousness, I grant you immortality.”
'36': >-
  When Brahmā stood ready to grant a boon to Kumbhakarṇa, all the gods, with
  folded hands, spoke to Prajāpati (the Lord of creatures):
'37': >-
  “A boon should not be granted by you to Kumbhakarṇa—not yet; for you know how
  this evil-minded one terrifies the worlds.”
'38': >-
  “In Nandana he has eaten seven Apsarases and ten attendants of great Indra;
  and, O Brahman, he has also devoured sages and human beings likewise.”
'39': >-
  “What this rākṣasa has done before obtaining any boon—if he were to obtain a
  boon, he would devour the three worlds!”
'40': >-
  “By the pretext of a boon, let delusion be given to him, O one of immeasurable
  splendor. Thus there will be welfare for the worlds, and there will also be
  his restraint and submission.”
'41': >-
  Thus addressed by the gods, Brahmā, the lotus-born, reflected; and when he had
  reflected, the goddess Sarasvatī came and stood by his side.
'42': >-
  Standing there with joined palms, Sarasvatī spoke these words: “I have come, O
  god; what work shall I do?”
'43': >-
  Prajāpati, seeing Sarasvatī arrive, spoke these words to her: “O Vāṇī (Goddess
  of Speech), become the speech of the lord of rākṣasas, as the gods desire.”
'44': >-
  “So be it,” she said; and entering (into him), she did so. Then Prajāpati
  said: “O Kumbhakarṇa, mighty-armed one, choose the boon that you deem best.”
'45': >-
  Hearing that statement, Kumbhakarṇa replied: “To sleep for many years, O God
  of gods—this is what I desire.”
'46': >-
  Saying to him, “So be it,” Brahmā departed together with the gods; and the
  goddess Sarasvatī, too, then left that rākṣasa once again.
'47': >-
  When Brahmā and the gods had gone to the region of the sky, he—released by
  Sarasvatī—recovered his own awareness and recognition.
'48': >-
  But Kumbhakarṇa, evil-souled, pondered sorrowfully: “What sort of utterance is
  this that has today fallen from my mouth?”
'49': >-
  “I believe I was deluded by the gods who came then.” Thus all the brothers,
  having obtained their boons and possessed of blazing splendor, went to the
  Śleṣmātaka forest, and there they dwelt in comfort.
'50': >-
  Thus ends the tenth canto, named “The Boons Granted to Rāvaṇa and Others,” in
  the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the sacred, ancient epic.
