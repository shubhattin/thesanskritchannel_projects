  Now, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  thirty-eighth sarga, called “The Ascent of Suvela.”
'1': >-
  Having resolved to ascend Suvela, Rāma—followed by Lakṣmaṇa—spoke these words
  to Sugrīva:
'2': >-
  (Speaking) in an exceedingly gentle and refined manner—(addressing) Vibhīṣaṇa
  also: the knower of dharma, the devoted rākṣasa, the one skilled in counsel
  and versed in proper procedure,
'3': >-
  “Come, let us all ascend this Suvela, an excellent lord among mountains,
  richly inlaid with hundreds of minerals; and let us dwell here for this night.
'4': >-
  “And we shall behold Laṅkā, the dwelling of that rākṣasa—by that wicked-souled
  one through whom my wife was carried off, leading to my very death.
'5': >-
  “By whom dharma is not understood—nor right conduct, nor likewise the dignity
  of lineage—by that she-demon of base intellect was that blameworthy deed
  committed.
'6': >-
  “At the very mention of that vilest of rākṣasas my wrath arises; because of
  the offence of that low man, I shall witness the slaughter of the rākṣasas.
'7': >-
  “Indeed, one man commits sin, coming under the noose of Time; through the base
  man’s misdeed, his entire lineage perishes.”
'8': >-
  Thus deliberating, and with anger toward Rāvaṇa, Rāma ascended Suvela for
  lodging, that mountain adorned with wondrous slopes and ridges.
'9': >-
  Behind him Lakṣmaṇa followed, composed and attentive, taking up his bow with
  arrows—delighting in great prowess.
'10': >-
  Sugrīva too ascended after him, together with his ministers and with
  Vibhīṣaṇa; and Hanumān, Aṅgada, Nīla, Mainda, and also Dvivida.
'11': >-
  (And) Gaja, Gavākṣa, Gavaya, Śarabha, Gandhamādana; Panasa, Kumuda, and also
  Hara; and Rambha, the leader of a troop.
'12': >-
  Jāmbavān and Suṣeṇa, and Ṛṣabha the great-minded; and Durmukha of great
  splendor, and likewise the monkey Śatabali.
'13': >-
  These and many other vānaras, swift of movement—inclined to the speed of the
  wind—wanderers of the mountains, (all) pressed on toward that peak.
'14': >-
  By hundreds they climbed Suvela, where the Rāghava was; and then, after a long
  while, having ascended the mountain from every side,
'15': >-
  they beheld, from its summit, that city as though fastened in the
  sky—auspicious, with excellent gates, and adorned with splendid ramparts.
'16': >-
  The leaders of the monkey-hosts beheld Laṅkā filled with rākṣasas, with
  rākṣasas stationed upon the excellent ramparts, dark-hued as well.
'17': >-
  Those foremost of monkeys also beheld another rampart that had been
  constructed (there).
'18': >-
  Seeing the rākṣasas, all the vānaras—yearning for battle—uttered diverse
  roars, while Rāma looked on.
'19': >-
  Then the sun set, reddened by twilight; and the night, illuminated by the full
  moon, passed on.
'20': >-
  Then Rāma, lord of the monkey-army, honored and duly welcomed by Vibhīṣaṇa,
  stayed upon the back of Suvela at ease—together with Lakṣmaṇa and with the
  many troops and troop-leaders.
'21': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-eighth sarga, called “The Ascent of Suvela,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval
  epic.
