  Now begins the third canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Description of Laṅkā’s Fortifications and the
  Like.”
'1': >-
  Having heard Sugrīva’s words—reasonable, well-grounded, and full of true
  import—Kākutstha (Rāma) accepted them, and then spoke to Hanumān.
'2': >-
  “By austerity, by the binding of a causeway, and even by drying up the
  ocean—by every means—I am indeed capable of crossing this sea.”
'3': >-
  “How many forts and defensive works does the fortress-city of Laṅkā possess?
  Tell me that. I wish to know it all, O Vānara, as though by direct sight.”
'4': >-
  “And the measure of their forces; and also the arrangements of the gate-forts;
  and the guarding and watch-duty of Laṅkā; and the dwellings of the Rākṣasas as
  well.”
'5': >-
  “Whatever you have seen in Laṅkā—at your ease and correctly—tell me all of it
  in accordance with the truth, in full; for in every way you are indeed
  competent.”
'6': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, Hanumān, son of the Wind-god—best among those skilled in
  speech—again addressed Rāma with his reply.
'7': >-
  “Listen: I shall relate everything, in due order, according to the manner of
  its fortifications—how Laṅkā, that city, is concealed and guarded, and how it
  is protected by its forces.”
'8': >-
  “And how the Rākṣasas are firmly devoted, through Rāvaṇa’s very majesty; and
  the supreme prosperity of Laṅkā; and also the dreadfulness of the ocean.”
'9': >-
  “And the division of the massed armies, and the deployment of their
  conveyances as well.” Having spoken thus, the best of monkeys narrated the
  facts in their true nature.
'10': >-
  Laṅkā was delighted and exultant, thronged with elephants in rut; vast, filled
  with chariots, and frequented by hosts of Rākṣasas.
'11': >-
  Its gate-panels were firmly fastened, and it possessed mighty bars; and it had
  four gates, broad and exceedingly great.
'12': >-
  There were arrow-engines and stone-casting devices—powerful and massive; by
  these the hostile army that approached was checked and repelled there.
'13': >-
  At the gates, fearsome śataghnīs, made of dark iron and keen-edged, were set
  in hundreds by the valiant hosts of Rākṣasas.
'14': >-
  And its great rampart was golden and hard to assail, inlaid within with
  jewels, coral, vaidūrya-gems, and pearls.
'15': >-
  And on all sides were moats—exceedingly terrible, filled with cool water and
  most auspicious in appearance—very deep, infested with crocodiles, and
  frequented by fishes.
'16': >-
  At those four gates were four bridges/causeways, extremely long, furnished
  with many great engines, and lined with long rows of buildings.
'17': >-
  There those causeways provide protection when an enemy force arrives; and by
  means of those engines they are made to be scattered down into the moats on
  every side.
'18': >-
  But one causeway in particular was unshakable, mighty, and exceedingly
  firm—adorned with many golden pillars and with platforms/altars.
'19': >-
  And Rāvaṇa himself, having taken his natural stance and wishing to fight,
  stood up vigilant, overseeing and inspecting his forces.
'20': >-
  Again, Laṅkā was without external support, a divine fortress bringing
  terror—unassailable; mountainous and forested, and also artificial—fourfold in
  its fortifications.
'21': >-
  It stands beyond the ocean, on the far shore, O Rāghava; there is no sea-route
  for ships there, and it is pathless and without clear access in every
  direction.
'22': >-
  A fortress was built upon a mountain-peak; that city was like the city of the
  gods—filled with horses and elephants; Laṅkā was exceedingly difficult to
  conquer.
'23': >-
  Moats, śataghnīs, and various engines of war adorned that city Laṅkā of the
  evil-souled Rāvaṇa.
'24': >-
  Ten thousand Rākṣasas there were stationed at the eastern gate—bearing spears
  in their hands, hard to assail, all fighting with sword-edges.
'25': >-
  At the southern gate were stationed one niyuta of Rākṣasas (a hundred
  thousand); and there too were warriors unsurpassed, together with a fourfold
  army.
'26': >-
  At the western gate were stationed one prayuta of Rākṣasas (a million); all
  were bearing shield and sword, and likewise all were skilled in every weapon.
'27': >-
  At the northern gate were stationed one nyarbuda of Rākṣasas (ten millions);
  and there were chariot-warriors and horsemen, noble-born sons of good
  families, highly honored.
'28': >-
  And in the central division were hundreds and thousands—Yātudhānas hard to
  assail—and, moreover, a total of a crore of Rākṣasas.
'29': >-
  “Those causeways were broken by me, and the moats were filled up; and the city
  of Laṅkā was burned, and the ramparts were thrown down. One portion of the
  forces of the great-souled Rākṣasas was destroyed.”
'30': >-
  “By whatever route we may cross the abode of Varuṇa (the ocean), let the city
  of Laṅkā be regarded by the Vānaras as already slain (as good as conquered).”
'31': >-
  “Aṅgada, Dvivida, Mainda, Jāmbavān, Panasa, Nala, and Nīla the
  commander-in-chief—what need have you of the remaining strength?”
'32': >-
  “For having gone—leaping across—to you, to Rāvaṇa’s great city, they will
  break it, together with its mountains and forests, with its walls and with its
  gateways, with its ramparts and with its palaces, and will bring it (to ruin),
  O Rāghava.”
'33': >-
  “Therefore command quickly the complete assembling of all the forces, and, at
  the proper moment and within a muhurta, resolve upon departure.”
'34': >-
  Thus ends the third canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the first of poems, entitled “The Description of Laṅkā’s
  Fortifications and the Like.”
