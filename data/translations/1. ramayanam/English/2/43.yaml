  Now begins the forty-third sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa in the venerable Śrī
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Kausalyā’s Lamentation.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter Kausalyā, seeing the king lying upon his couch, overwhelmed with
  grief, and herself tormented by sorrow for her son, spoke to the lord of the
  earth.
'2': >-
  “With the tiger among men, Rāghava, sent away, Kaikeyī—like a serpent that has
  cast off its venom—will roam about; indeed she will move freely like a
  she-serpent set loose.”
'3': >-
  “Having exiled Rāma, that fortunate woman, her desire fulfilled and her
  purpose accomplished, will again strike terror into me—like a wicked snake
  within the house.”
'4': >-
  “Now Rāma may wander in this city seeking alms, and dwell from house to house;
  and you, acting at another’s pleasure, may even grant a boon by giving away my
  own son as though he were a slave.”
'5': >-
  “But having cast Rāma down from his station according to her will, Kaikeyī has
  become a portion for the rākṣasas, like an oblation consigned to the fire on a
  festival day.”
'6': >-
  “That heroic one, whose gait is like the lord of serpents, the mighty-armed
  bearer of the bow, surely enters the forest—together with his wife and with
  Lakṣmaṇa.”
'7': >-
  “When, with your consent and by Kaikeyī’s approval, those who have never
  before known the miseries of the wilderness are abandoned to
  forest-dwelling—what condition will be theirs?”
'8': >-
  “Deprived of jewels, still young, exiled at the very time of fruition, how
  will those pitiable ones live, having their food made of fruits and roots?”
'9': >-
  “May that auspicious time come even now—the blessed ending of my grief—when I
  might behold Rāghava here, together with his wife and with his brother.”
'10': >-
  “When will Ayodhyā become, upon merely hearing that the two heroes have
  arrived, illustrious and filled with rejoicing people, adorned with banners
  raised aloft?”
'11': >-
  “When, beholding the tiger among men returned again from the forest, will the
  city be glad—like the ocean on the day of the full moon?”
'12': >-
  “When will the mighty-armed hero enter Ayodhyā, leading in front in his
  chariot Sītā, like a bull leading a cow?”
'13': >-
  “When will thousands of beings in the royal highway shower parched grain upon
  my two sons as they enter, those subduers of enemies?”
'14': >-
  “When they enter Ayodhyā, when shall I behold those two wearing auspicious
  ear-ornaments, their weapons and swords uplifted—like two mountains with their
  peaks?”
'15': >-
  “When will the glad maidens bearing lovely flowers, and the twice-born
  bringing fruits, go about the city in joyous procession, making
  circumambulation?”
'16': >-
  “When will the righteous-souled one, matured in understanding and in age, with
  the splendor of a cāmara, approach—caressing like a rain-cloud that showers
  well?”
'17': >-
  “Surely, O hero, I think that formerly, because of some miserly deed of mine,
  the breasts of mothers were wounded when their calves, eager to drink, were
  kept away.”
'18': >-
  “Thus I—like a cow whose calf has been seized by a lion—have been made
  calf-less though full of affection; by Kaikeyī, O tiger among men, I have been
  forcibly treated like a cow deprived of her young calf.”
'19': >-
  “For without my only son—him who is endowed with virtues and skilled in all
  the śāstras—I cannot bring myself to live.”
'20': >-
  “Indeed, in life I see no power, no worth, no capacity for myself here, if I
  do not behold my beloved son and Lakṣmaṇa of great might.”
'21': >-
  “This fire, born of grief for my son, blazing fiercely, burns me today; it
  lights up this whole earth with its radiance, like the glorious Lord Sun at
  the height of summer.”
'22': >-
  Thus ends the forty-third sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “Kausalyā’s Lamentation.”
