  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, the sixtieth chapter
  named “Triśaṅku’s Heaven.”
'1': >-
  Knowing that the Vāsiṣṭha sages had been subdued by the power of austerity,
  the mighty and effulgent Viśvāmitra spoke in the midst of the ṛṣis, whose
  fortunes were great.
'2': >-
  “This one is renowned as Triśaṅku, a descendant of Ikṣvāku—righteous, and
  generous—and he has indeed come to me for refuge.
'3': >-
  “With this very body of his, desiring to conquer the world of the gods, he
  intends to go to the celestial realm in his own bodily form.
'4': >-
  “Therefore let a sacrifice be undertaken by you, together with me, to bring
  about that very result.” Hearing the words of Viśvāmitra, all the great sages,
'5': >-
  assembled at once, spoke words in accordance with dharma, for they were
  knowers of righteousness: “This descendant of Kuśika, this sage, is one of
  exceedingly fierce wrath.
'6': >-
  “Whatever word he has spoken is proper; it must indeed be carried out—there is
  no doubt. For the blessed one is like fire; in anger he will utter a curse.
'7': >-
  “Therefore let the sacrifice be set in motion, so that, embodied, this
  descendant of Ikṣvāku may go to heaven by the splendour of Viśvāmitra.”
'8': >-
  Then the sacrifice was initiated, and all of them took their respective
  stations. Having spoken thus, the great sages then undertook those ritual
  acts.
'9': >-
  And in that rite, the radiant Viśvāmitra became the officiating priest; and
  the ṛtviks, in due order—learned in mantras and performing with mantras—were
  appointed.
'10': >-
  They performed all the acts, according to the prescribed rule and according to
  ordinance. Then, after a great lapse of time, Viśvāmitra of great austerity,
'11': >-
  made invocation there of all the gods for their allotted shares. But at that
  time none of the gods came there to receive their portions.
'12': >-
  Then the great sage Viśvāmitra, seized by wrath, lifting up the ladle in
  anger, spoke these words to Triśaṅku:
'13': >-
  “Behold the power of my austerity, O lord of men—won by my own effort. I shall
  by my might lead you to heaven with this very body of yours.
'14': >-
  “Go to heaven with your own body, O king—though it is hard to attain thus. For
  some fruit of austerity, earned by my own striving, truly belongs to me.”
'15': >-
  “O king, by that splendour, go embodied to the heavenly region.” When the sage
  had spoken thus, the lord of men,
'16': >-
  went to heaven in bodily form, O Kakutstha, while the sages looked on. Seeing
  Triśaṅku gone to the world of heaven, Indra, the chastiser of Pāka,
'17': >-
  spoke these words, together with all the hosts of gods: “Triśaṅku, go back
  again; you are not one whose abode has been made in heaven.
'18': >-
  “Struck down by your guru’s curse, deluded one, fall headlong to the earth!”
  Thus addressed by great Indra, Triśaṅku began to fall once more,
'19': >-
  crying out, “Save me, save me!” to Viśvāmitra, the treasure of austerity.
  Hearing that cry of his, as he wailed, the Kauśika sage
'20': >-
  was seized by fierce anger and said, “Stay! Stay!” In the midst of the ṛṣis,
  that radiant one stood like another Prajāpati,
'21': >-
  creating anew other Saptarṣis stationed in the southern path; and, overcome by
  wrath, he produced another lineage of constellations.
'22': >-
  Turning toward the southern quarter, the highly renowned one, in the midst of
  the sages, after creating that lineage of stars, became sullied by anger,
'23': >-
  and said, “I shall make another Indra, or else the world shall be without an
  Indra!” And in wrath he even set about creating other deities.
'24': >-
  Then the gods and asuras—together with the assemblages of sages—utterly
  alarmed, spoke to great-souled Viśvāmitra with conciliatory words:
'25': >-
  “This king is most fortunate, yet he has been afflicted by his guru’s curse.
  He does not deserve to go to heaven in his body, O treasure of austerity.
'26': >-
  Hearing those words of the gods, the foremost of sages—Kauśika—spoke a very
  great utterance to all the deities:
'27': >-
  “May good be yours. For this king Triśaṅku, I have promised ascent to heaven
  in bodily form; I am not able to make my word untrue.
'28': >-
  “Let there be an everlasting heaven for embodied Triśaṅku; and let all these
  stars be mine, fixed and steadfast.
'29': >-
  “So long as the worlds shall endure, let all these remain in every way. O
  gods, you ought to grant assent to what has been done.”
'30': >-
  Thus addressed, all the gods replied to that foremost of sages: “So be it.
  Blessings be upon you. Let all these remain in every way.”
'31': >-
  Those many stars, O best of sages, in the sky, outside the path of Vaiśvānara
  (the sun), blazed with light among those luminaries.
'32': >-
  “And let Triśaṅku, with head downwards, remain there, shining like a planet;
  and let these lights follow that best of kings.”
'33': >-
  Thus Triśaṅku became accomplished in purpose, renowned, as one who has
  attained the world of heaven. And Viśvāmitra, righteous-souled, was praised by
  all the gods.
'34': >-
  In the midst of the sages, the mighty one—while the deities said, “So be
  it”—then, at the end of the sacrifice, O best of men, all the great-souled
  gods and the austerity-rich sages departed, each to his own place, as they had
  come.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the sixtieth chapter, named “Triśaṅku’s Heaven,” in the Bālakāṇḍa of
  the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic.
