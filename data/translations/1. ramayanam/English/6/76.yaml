  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the
  seventy-sixth chapter, called “The Slaying of Kampana and others.”
'1': >-
  When that dreadful, confused battle was in full course, amid a great
  destruction of heroic warriors, Aṅgada—eager for combat—came upon the mighty
  hero Kampana.
'2': >-
  Summoning Aṅgada in wrath, the impetuous Kampana first struck him with his
  mace; and Aṅgada, grievously smitten, reeled.
'3': >-
  Regaining consciousness, the radiant one hurled a mountain-peak; and Kampana,
  struck by that blow, fell to the ground.
'4': >-
  Then, seeing Kampana slain in battle, Śoṇitākṣa swiftly rushed there in his
  chariot toward fearless Aṅgada.
'5': >-
  Then the impetuous Śoṇitākṣa pierced Aṅgada with sharp arrows—keen,
  body-rending shafts, like embodied Time’s fire.
'6': >-
  With razor-headed shafts, broad-headed arrows, Vatsadanta and Śilīmukha
  arrows, with ear-tearing and marrow-rending missiles—many keen arrows—he
  struck him.
'7': >-
  Aṅgada, the valiant son of Vāli, though his limbs were pierced, in his might
  crushed with force the fierce bow, the chariot, and the arrows.
'8': >-
  Thereupon Śoṇitākṣa quickly took up sword and shield, and—angry, swift, and
  without reflection—sprang up.
'9': >-
  Leaping at him even more swiftly, the strong Aṅgada seized him; with his hand
  he struck away that sword, and roared aloud.
'10': >-
  Then Aṅgada smote his shoulder-joint with the sword; and the elephant among
  monkeys cut him down, as though he were a sacrificial thread.
'11': >-
  Grasping that great sword and roaring again and again, Vāli’s son rushed at
  the foremost of foes on the battlefield.
'12': >-
  Then the powerful hero Yūpākṣa, together with Prajaṅgha, advanced in his
  chariot, enraged, against the mighty son of Vāli.
'13': >-
  Taking up an iron mace, that hero—gold-ornamented—Śoṇitākṣa, having steadied
  himself, also charged at him indeed.
'14': >-
  And Prajaṅgha, the great hero, powerful and accompanied by Yūpākṣa, advanced
  in anger against the mighty son of Vāli with his mace.
'15': >-
  Between Śoṇitākṣa and Prajaṅgha, that best of monkeys shone like the full moon
  set between two branches of the forked Viśākhā constellation.
'16': >-
  Mainda and Dvivida, protecting Aṅgada, stood near him, each watching the
  other.
'17': >-
  Huge-bodied, mighty rākṣasas, armed with swords, arrows, and maces, rushed
  forward in fury against the vānaras.
'18': >-
  Among those three lordly vānaras locked with three foremost rākṣasas, there
  arose a great battle—hair-raising to behold.
'19': >-
  Taking up trees, they hurled them in the combat; but Prajaṅgha of great
  strength struck those back with his sword.
'20': >-
  Chariots, horses, trees, and rocks were hurled back in the battle; and Yūpākṣa
  of great strength cut them apart with volleys of arrows.
'21': >-
  Uprooting trees hurled by Dvivida and Mainda, the valiant and illustrious
  Śoṇitākṣa shattered them in mid-course with his mace.
'22': >-
  Lifting his broad sword, a supreme splitter of vital spots, Prajaṅgha rushed
  swiftly toward the son of Vāli.
'23': >-
  Seeing him come close, the mighty lord of monkeys then struck him with a
  tree—an aśvakarṇa—of tremendous strength.
'24': >-
  He also struck his sword-bearing arm with his fist; by the son of Vāli’s blow,
  he fell to the earth, his sword dropped.
'25': >-
  Seeing that mace-like sword fallen on the ground, the mighty one clenched his
  fist, like a thunderbolt.
'26': >-
  That radiant, exceedingly powerful one struck Aṅgada, the bull among vānaras,
  on the forehead; and he staggered for a moment.
'27': >-
  Regaining consciousness, the radiant, valiant son of Vāli struck off
  Prajaṅgha’s head from his body with his fist.
'28': >-
  Yūpākṣa, his eyes filled with tears at his uncle slain in battle, quickly
  descended from his chariot; his arrows spent, he took up a sword.
'29': >-
  Seeing Yūpākṣa rushing in, Dvivida hurried, and in anger struck him on the
  chest; then the strong one seized him by force.
'30': >-
  Seeing his brother seized, mighty Śoṇitākṣa, of great splendor, struck Dvivida
  on the chest.
'31': >-
  Struck by him, that mighty one reeled; and then Dvivida again snatched away
  his upraised mace.
'32': >-
  In the meantime Mainda came close to Dvivida; the valiant one struck Yūpākṣa
  on the chest with the palm of his hand.
'33': >-
  Then Śoṇitākṣa and Yūpākṣa, against those two swift monkeys, engaged in fierce
  grappling and violent wrenching in battle.
'34': >-
  Dvivida tore Śoṇitākṣa in the face with his nails, and with his strength
  dashed him down upon the earth and crushed him.
'35': >-
  Mainda, greatly enraged at Yūpākṣa, that foremost of monkeys, pressed him
  tightly with his arms; and he fell slain upon the ground.
'36': >-
  Thus the rākṣasa host, bereft of its champions and distressed, moved facing
  toward where Kumbha, the son of Kumbhakarṇa, was.
'37': >-
  Seeing that army rushing in with speed, Kumbha consoled the host; and then, as
  the vānaras of great valor had gained their mark, he—
'38': >-
  —seeing the rākṣasa host felled and its great heroes laid low, the radiant
  Kumbha undertook in battle a deed most difficult.
'39': >-
  That foremost among archers, taking up his bow with perfect composure,
  released arrows like venomous serpents, rending bodies.
'40': >-
  Again his supreme bow, with its arrow, shone—like a second Indra’s bow,
  blazing like lightning and Airāvata’s radiance.
'41': >-
  Then, with a shaft drawn to the ear and released, he struck Dvivida—an arrow
  with golden feathers and wings, like one clad in leaf-armor.
'42': >-
  Suddenly smitten by it, his footing giving way, trembling, the best of monkeys
  fell—like Tri-kuṭa—reeling in distress.
'43': >-
  But Mainda, seeing his brother broken there in the great battle, rushed
  forward swiftly, taking up a huge rock.
'44': >-
  That mighty one hurled the rock at the rākṣasa; Kumbha shattered that rock
  with five clear, keen arrows.
'45': >-
  Fitting another well-aimed arrow, like a venomous serpent, that great-souled
  one struck the elder brother of Dvivida upon the chest.
'46': >-
  By that blow Mainda, the leader of the monkey-troops, struck in a vital spot,
  fell upon the earth unconscious.
'47': >-
  Aṅgada, seeing his two maternal uncles—both very mighty—beaten down, rushed in
  speed at Kumbha, whose bow was raised.
'48': >-
  Kumbha pierced him as he charged with five iron arrows, and with three other
  sharp shafts like javelins against an elephant; thus the powerful Kumbha
  pierced Aṅgada with many arrows.
'49': >-
  Though his limbs were pierced with unblunted, sharp, keen arrows, adorned with
  gold, Aṅgada, Vāli’s son, did not waver.
'50': >-
  He showered rocks and trees upon his head; Kumbha cut them all down and again
  split the rocks as well.
'51': >-
  The illustrious son of Kumbhakarṇa, Kumbha, seeing the troop-leader of monkeys
  advancing, spurred on by Vāli’s son—
'52': >-
  —pierced his eyebrows with two arrows, like two meteors striking an elephant;
  blood flowed from him, and his eyes were covered.
'53': >-
  With his hand Aṅgada covered his eyes, drenched with blood; and with the other
  hand he grasped a sāla tree close at hand.
'54': >-
  Pressing it to his chest and setting his hand upon its shoulder, bending it a
  little, he shook it violently in that great battle.
'55': >-
  That tree, like Indra’s banner, resembling Mount Mandara, he flung with speed
  while all the rākṣasas looked on.
'56': >-
  Kumbha cut it with seven sharp, body-splitting arrows; Aṅgada was repeatedly
  pained, and he fell down and swooned.
'57': >-
  Seeing Aṅgada fallen, sinking as though into the sea, the foremost of
  monkeys—finding the foe hard to approach—reported it to Rāghava.
'58': >-
  Rāma, hearing that Vāli’s son was stricken in the great battle, commanded the
  foremost of monkeys, headed by Jāmbavān.
'59': >-
  Those tiger-like vānaras, hearing Rāma’s command, rushed forth in great wrath
  against Kumbha, whose bow was raised.
'60': >-
  Then those bulls among vānaras, hands full of trees and rocks, eyes reddened
  with anger, charged to protect Aṅgada.
'61': >-
  Jāmbavān, Suṣeṇa, and the vānaras swift to perceive advantage, enraged, ran
  together toward Kumbhakarṇa’s heroic son.
'62': >-
  Beholding those mighty lords of monkeys rushing in, he covered them with a
  flood of arrows, as a mountain pours down water into a lake.
'63': >-
  Entering the path of his arrows, those great-souled lords of monkeys could not
  even look on—like the shore before the great ocean.
'64': >-
  Seeing those troops of monkeys tormented by showers of arrows, Sugrīva, the
  lord of monkeys, placed Aṅgada behind him—his sister’s son.
'65': >-
  Then Sugrīva rushed at Kumbhakarṇa’s son in battle, like a swift lion charging
  a mountain-ranging serpent.
'66': >-
  Uprooting many great trees—such as aśvakarṇas and others—and various other
  trees besides, that great monkey hurled them.
'67': >-
  That tree-rain, filling the sky and hard to withstand, the illustrious son of
  Kumbhakarṇa cut apart with his own sharp arrows.
'68': >-
  Those trees, struck by Kumbha’s keen arrows with fierce precision, shone like
  dreadful iron clubs; and seeing that tree-rain broken by Kumbha, the valiant—
'69': >-
  —illustrious lord of monkeys, of great spirit, did not falter; though suddenly
  being pierced, he endured those arrows.
'70': >-
  Seizing Kumbha’s bow, Sugrīva broke it—shining like Indra’s bow—then,
  springing back swiftly, he performed a deed most difficult.
'71': >-
  Then, angered, he spoke to Kumbha, like an elephant with broken tusks: “O
  hero, elder brother of Nikumbha—your prowess, that speed of arrows, is
  wondrous indeed!
'72': >-
  Whether your humility and majesty—or Rāvaṇa’s—are like that of Prahlāda, Bali,
  Vṛtra’s slayer, and like Kubera and Varuṇa.
'73': >-
  You alone are born after a father yet stronger; you alone, mighty-armed,
  bearing a spear, subduer of foes—
'74': >-
  —the gods do not overstep you, as maladies do not overstep one who has
  conquered his senses. Display your valor, O great-minded one, and behold my
  deeds!
'75': >-
  By the boon, your uncle withstands gods and demons; and Kumbhakarṇa, by his
  strength, withstands celestials and asuras.
'76': >-
  In archery you are equal to Indrajit, and in might to Rāvaṇa; today in the
  rākṣasa world you are the foremost in strength and valor.
'77': >-
  Wondrous is this great crushing combat in battle between you and me; today let
  all beings behold it, as that between Śakra and Śambara.
'78': >-
  A peerless deed has been done and skill in weapons displayed; these heroic
  vānaras of terrible prowess have been cast down by you.
'79': >-
  And out of fear of reproach, O hero, I have not slain you; you are wearied by
  deeds done—rest now, and behold my strength!
'80': >-
  Honored by that contemptuous speech of Sugrīva, his splendor increased—like
  fire into which clarified butter is poured.
'81': >-
  Then Kumbha seized Sugrīva with both arms, like two elephants beyond the rut’s
  madness, repeatedly breathing hard.
'82': >-
  Clasping each other’s limbs, grinding against one another, they sent forth
  from their mouths smoky flames due to exertion.
'83': >-
  From the impact of their feet the earth sank down; and the ocean, abode of
  Varuṇa, churned up with whirling waves.
'84': >-
  Then, lifting up Kumbha, Sugrīva hurled him with speed into the salty waters,
  showing him the ocean’s depths.
'85': >-
  By Kumbha’s fall, the mass of water surged up, spreading on all sides, like
  the Vindhya and Mandara mountains.
'86': >-
  Then Kumbha sprang up, rushed at Sugrīva, and in anger struck him on the chest
  with a fist like a thunderbolt.
'87': >-
  His armor burst apart and blood appeared; that fist of great speed smote upon
  the circle of bones.
'88': >-
  By that force a great blazing splendor arose there—like a flame born of a
  thunderbolt’s grinding, on Mount Meru.
'89': >-
  Struck there by him, Sugrīva, the bull among vānaras, clenched his fist, like
  a thunderbolt, in his great strength.
'90': >-
  Glittering with the luster of thousands of spreading flames, the valiant one
  brought that fist down upon Kumbha’s chest.
'91': >-
  By that blow, severely tormented and utterly shaken, Kumbha fell then, like
  fire whose blaze has gone out.
'92': >-
  Smitten by that fist, the rākṣasa quickly fell—like the red-bodied sun,
  blazing with rays, falling from the sky unawares.
'93': >-
  The form of Kumbha as he fell, his chest broken by the fist, appeared like the
  form of a bull struck down by Rudra.
'94': >-
  When he was slain in battle by the bull among the monkeys, of dreadful
  prowess, the earth—with its mountains and forests—shook; and great fear
  entered the rākṣasas.
'95': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-sixth chapter in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Slaying of Kampana and others.”
