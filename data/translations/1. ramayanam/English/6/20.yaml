  Now begins the twentieth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the illustrious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Stratagem to Create Dissension in Sugrīva.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon, the mighty rākṣasa named Śārdūla, having come near, beheld that
  army encamped, protected and governed by Sugrīva.
'2': >-
  A spy of the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, king of the rākṣasas—having seen that host,
  unconfused and vigilant on every side—returned again, that rākṣasa.
'3': >-
  Entering Laṅkā with speed, he spoke these words to the king: “This very
  multitude of vānaras and bears is advancing upon Laṅkā.”
'4': >-
  “Deep and immeasurable, like a second ocean, are these two brothers—Rāma and
  Lakṣmaṇa, the sons of Daśaratha.”
'5': >-
  “Excellent, possessed of beauty and perfection of form, they have come to
  recover Sītā; having reached the ocean, those two of great splendour are
  encamped.”
'6': >-
  “And the army, covering the sky on every side for ten yojanas—its true
  condition, O great king, you ought to know quickly.”
'7': >-
  “Your envoys, O great king, should quickly ascertain it. Let conciliation with
  gifts, or soothing words, or else sowing dissension be employed here.”
'8': >-
  Hearing Śārdūla’s words, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, suddenly and in
  agitation spoke, considering his own advantage; and he addressed Śuka, the
  rākṣasa, foremost among those who know the meaning of words, thus:
'9': >-
  “Go at once and speak to King Sugrīva my message—according to these
  instructions—without timidity, in smooth and exceedingly gentle speech.”
'10': >-
  “You indeed are born of a royal lineage, you are of great strength, and you
  are the son of Ṛkṣaraja. No advantage of yours is absent, nor is any
  misfortune present; even so, O lord of monkeys, you are to me as a brother.”
'11': >-
  “If I have carried off the wife of the wise prince—what is that to you,
  Sugrīva? Let him go back toward Kiṣkindhā.”
'12': >-
  “For this Laṅkā cannot in any way be reached by monkeys. Even by the gods
  together with the Gandharvas—how much less by men and monkeys!”
'13': >-
  Then Śuka, a night-ranger, thus instructed by the lord of rākṣasas, became
  like a bird and swiftly sprang up into the sky.
'14': >-
  Having gone a long distance, soaring above and above the ocean, he remained
  stationed in mid-air and spoke these words to Sugrīva:
'15': >-
  All that had been spoken, just as commanded by the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa—while
  he was delivering that message, the vānaras, leaping up in haste,
'16': >-
  rushed quickly to seize him, to tear him, and to kill him with their fists;
  forcibly, by all the monkeys, the night-ranger was overpowered.
'17': >-
  Swiftly, from the sky down to the surface of the earth, he was caught and
  pulled down; and while being tormented by the vānaras, Śuka spoke these words:
'18': >-
  “O Kakutstha, envoys are not slain—let the monkeys be restrained, rightly so.
  But that envoy who, abandoning the intention of his master, would frame his
  own intent—being an envoy, speaking without having been told—such an envoy
  deserves death.”
'19': >-
  But Rāma, having heard Śuka’s lamenting words, said to those foremost of
  monkeys who were striking him, “Do not kill him.”
'20': >-
  And he, becoming light as a leaf, when the monkeys had shown him freedom from
  fear, rose and remained in the open air, and again spoke these words:
'21': >-
  “Sugrīva, endowed with valour, of great strength and prowess—what indeed am I
  to say of Rāvaṇa, the terror of the worlds?”
'22': >-
  Thus addressed, then the lord of vānaras—bull among the monkeys,
  mighty—Sugrīva, of pure and undaunted spirit, spoke words to Śuka, the spy of
  the night-rangers:
'23': >-
  “You are not my friend, nor are you worthy of such compassion; you are no
  benefactor, nor are you dear to me. You are an enemy of Rāma, along with your
  adherents—therefore, like Vālī, you deserve to be slain, fit to be killed.”
'24': >-
  “I shall slay you—with your sons, with your kinsmen, with your whole circle of
  relations—O lord of night-rangers; and all Laṅkā too, with great force, I
  shall approach with all (my hosts) and reduce to ashes.”
'25': >-
  “You will not be released, Rāvaṇa—O deluded one—even if guarded by the gods
  together with Indra. Though you hide yourself, though you go by the path of
  the sun, even if you enter Pātāla; or though you take refuge at the lotus-feet
  of Girīśa (Śiva)—you will be slain by Rāma together with his younger brother.”
'26': >-
  “For you, in the three worlds, I see no rescuer—no piśāca, no rākṣasa; no
  Gandharva, and no asura.”
'27': >-
  “You slew the aged king of vultures, Jaṭāyus, worn with years. How then, in
  the very presence of Rāma, and near Lakṣmaṇa, did you carry off Sītā of large
  eyes—she whom you have seized, yet do not understand?”
'28': >-
  “You do not comprehend the greatly mighty, great-souled, unconquerable—even by
  the gods—best of the Raghus, who will take away your life-breaths.”
'29': >-
  Then even Aṅgada, son of Vālī, best of monkeys, spoke: “This one, O great
  king, does not seem to me to be an envoy; he appears to be a spy.”
'30': >-
  “For, while he stands here, he has weighed and assessed all your forces. Let
  him be seized—do not let him go to Laṅkā: this is what pleases me.”
'31': >-
  Then, commanded by the king, the monkeys sprang up, seized him, and bound him,
  as he wailed like one without protection.
'32': >-
  But Śuka, harshly pressed there by those fierce monkeys, cried out to the
  great-souled Rāma, son of Daśaratha: “By force my wings are being torn away;
  my eyes too are being crushed!”
'33': >-
  “That night on which I shall die, and that night when I shall depart—within
  this interval of time, whatever evil deed I have committed—may all that come
  to pass, if I should indeed abandon my life!”
'34': >-
  Then Rāma did not have him struck, having heard that lament. Rāma spoke to the
  monkeys: “Let the envoy who has come be released.”
'35': >-
  Thus ends the twentieth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Stratagem to
  Create Dissension in Sugrīva.”
