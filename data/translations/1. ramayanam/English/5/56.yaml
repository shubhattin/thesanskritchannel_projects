  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in Sundara-kāṇḍa, the
  fifty-sixth canto, named “The Upward Leap for the Return Journey.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter, beneath the śiṃśapā tree, approaching Jānakī as she stood there,
  Hanumān bowed in reverence and said: “By good fortune I behold you here,
  unharmed.”
'2': >-
  Then Sītā, watching him as he set forth—again and again looking after
  him—spoke to Hanumān, her words filled with affection for her lord.
'3': >-
  “If you deem it fit, dear one, stay here for a single day, O sinless one;
  having rested in some well-concealed place, you may depart tomorrow.”
'4': >-
  “And for me—so scant in good fortune—by your very presence, O Vānara, there
  might be, even for a moment, some diminution of this immeasurable grief.”
'5': >-
  “For, O tiger among monkeys, once you have gone, even your returning again—of
  that I have no confidence, not even as regards my own life-breaths, O foremost
  of Vānaras.”
'6': >-
  “And your absence again, O hero, will tear me still more—me who have already
  fallen into sorrow worse than sorrow, crushed by dejection and grief.”
'7': >-
  “And, O hero, this great doubt seems to stand right before me—(though there
  are) mighty allies, the Vānaras and bears, of great strength.”
'8': >-
  “How indeed will those armies of Vānaras and bears—or those two sons of the
  best of men—cross the ocean, so hard to pass?”
'9': >-
  “For crossing the ocean, there would be power only in three beings—Vainateya
  (Garuḍa), or in you, or in your father Māruta (the Wind).”
'10': >-
  “So, when this pressing necessity of the task has arisen, difficult to
  overcome—what solution do you see here? For you are skilled in accomplishing
  affairs.”
'11': >-
  “Indeed, you alone are sufficient to bring this work to completion, O slayer
  of enemy-heroes; the fruit that will arise for you will be glorious.”
'12': >-
  “But if Kakutstha (Rāma), destroyer of hostile forces, were to bring me back
  after filling Laṅkā with his might, then that would be worthy of him.”
'13': >-
  “Therefore, in such a way as is fitting to the valor of that great-souled one,
  that hero in battle, do you so arrange it to come to pass.”
'14': >-
  Having heard that speech—well-meant, humble, and furnished with
  reasons—Hanumān the hero spoke in reply.
'15': >-
  “O Goddess, the lord of the armies of Vānaras and bears, the best of those who
  can leap—Sugrīva—endowed with courage, has resolved firmly for your sake.”
'16': >-
  “Surrounded by crores of thousands of monkeys, Sugrīva, lord of the leaping
  hosts, will swiftly come, O Vaidehī.”
'17': >-
  “And those two heroes, the best of men—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—together will come to
  the city of Laṅkā and will lay it waste with their arrows.”
'18': >-
  “Having slain the rākṣasas with their followers, in no long time the delighter
  of the Raghus will take you, O fair-hipped lady, and go toward his own city.”
'19': >-
  “Be comforted; auspiciousness to you. Become one who awaits the right time.
  Soon you shall see Rāvaṇa struck down by Rāma in battle.”
'20': >-
  “And when the lord of rākṣasas is slain—together with his sons, ministers, and
  kinsmen—you shall be reunited with Rāma, like Rohiṇī with the moon.”
'21': >-
  “Kakutstha will quickly come, accompanied by the foremost of Vānaras and
  bears—he who, having conquered your enemies in war, will remove your sorrow.”
'22': >-
  Thus reassuring Vaidehī, Hanumān, son of Māruta, resolved upon departure and
  bowed to Vaidehī in reverence.
'23': >-
  Having slain the foremost rākṣasas, having made his own name renowned, having
  comforted Vaidehī, and having displayed his supreme might,
'24': >-
  having thrown the city into turmoil, having outwitted Rāvaṇa, having shown his
  dreadful power, and having bowed to Vaidehī,
'25': >-
  he set his mind to return again—across the midst of the ocean. Then that tiger
  among monkeys, eager to behold his lord,
'26': >-
  ascended the foremost of mountains—Ariṣṭa—the subduer of foes, adorned with
  lofty groves of dark-blue forests frequented by tall padmaka trees.
'27': >-
  With clouds hanging between its peaks, it seemed as though draped in an upper
  garment; and it was as though being awakened with delight by the auspicious
  rays of the sun.
'28': >-
  With minerals like eyes opening wide, as it were, it seemed to gaze; and with
  the deep, resounding roar of its torrents, it seemed to be chanting lessons,
  as it were—the mountain.
'29': >-
  With the clear sounds of many cascades, it seemed to sing distinctly; with
  deodāra trees swaying aloft, it stood as though with arms raised upward.
'30': >-
  With the thunderous din of falling waters, it seemed to cry out on every side;
  with dark autumnal woods trembling and quivering, it seemed to shake.
'31': >-
  With bamboos shaken by the wind, and with reeds as though making calls, it
  seemed to cry aloud; with terrible foremost serpents, it seemed to breathe out
  in wrath.
'32': >-
  With caves made deep by mist, it seemed to meditate; with foothills like
  cloud-masses, it seemed to stride forward on every side.
'33': >-
  With its peaks amid banks of clouds, it seemed to yawn in the sky; strewn in
  many ways with crags, it was splendid with many caverns.
'34': >-
  Encompassed by many sāla trees, tāla palms, and karṇa trees, and by numerous
  bamboos; adorned with canopies of spreading creepers, full of blossoms,
'35': >-
  strewn with herds of many kinds of beasts; beautified by streams of
  mineral-ores; furnished with many springs; and difficult with heaps of rocks,
'36': >-
  frequented by great sages, yakṣas, gandharvas, kiṃnaras, and serpents; dense
  with creepers and trees; with caverns inhabited by lions,
'37': >-
  thronged with tigers and the like, and possessing trees with sweet roots and
  fruits—upon that mountain the son of the Wind, the foremost of monkeys,
  climbed.
'38': >-
  Urged on by the exhilaration of swiftly seeing Rāma, with his feet he pressed
  upon the lovely slopes of the mountain,
'39': >-
  and then the rocks shattered with a loud crash, ground into powder. Having
  mounted that lord of mountains, the great monkey grew in size.
'40': >-
  Seeking the further shore—northward—from the southern side of the salt ocean,
  the hero, the son of the Wind, then climbed to the summit of the mountain.
'41': >-
  He beheld the dreadful ocean, resorted to by dreadful serpents—he who, born of
  Māruta, was like the wind moving through the sky.
'42': >-
  That tiger among monkeys then advanced from the southern direction toward the
  northern; and then, pressed by that monkey, that excellent mountain,
'43': >-
  roared with diverse creatures and sank into the surface of the earth—its peaks
  shaking, and its trees too falling down.
'44': >-
  Trees laden with blossoms, torn up by the mighty force of his rush, fell
  broken upon the ground, as though struck by Indra’s thunderbolt.
'45': >-
  From within the caverns, the dreadful roar of lions of great vigor—pressed
  hard in their lairs—was heard, as though splitting the sky.
'46': >-
  Vidyādhara maidens, their garments disordered in terror and their ornaments
  thrown into confusion, suddenly flew up from that mountain.
'47': >-
  Great serpents, of enormous size and strength, with blazing tongues and potent
  venom— their heads and necks pressed down—coiled about in agitation.
'48': >-
  Kiṃnaras, serpents, gandharvas, yakṣas, and vidyādharas likewise, abandoning
  that best of mountains thus oppressed, took to the sky.
'49': >-
  And that splendid bearer of the earth, pressed by his strength, with its
  treetops and summits uplifted, plunged into Rasātala (the nether region).
'50': >-
  That mountain—ten yojanas in breadth and thirty yojanas in height—became level
  with the earth’s surface.
'51': >-
  Wishing to leap across the formidable salt ocean, with ease Hanumān sprang up
  into the sky—toward the boundary of waves and surges.
'52': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-sixth canto of Sundara-kāṇḍa in the venerable, illustrious
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the first poet—named “The Upward Leap for the
  Return Journey.”
