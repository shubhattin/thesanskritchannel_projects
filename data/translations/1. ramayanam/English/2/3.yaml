'0': >-
  Now begins the third sarga, named “Instruction to the Princes
  (Putrānuśāsanam),” in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  Then, receiving on every side their lotus-like palms held together in reverent
  salutation, the king accepted their homage and spoke to them words that were
  dear and wholesome.
'2': >-
  “Indeed I am supremely pleased, and my majesty is exceedingly enhanced, in
  that you desire my eldest and beloved son to be established in the office of
  Prince Regent.”
'3': >-
  Thus having duly honored them, the king said this to the brāhmaṇas—while
  Vasiṣṭha and Vāmadeva themselves listened there.
'4': >-
  “This month of Caitra is auspicious and splendid, with sacredness upon it and
  forests abloom with flowers. Let everything, in its entirety, be made ready
  for the consecration of Rāma as Prince Regent.”
'5': >-
  When the king had ceased speaking, a mighty roar of acclamation arose among
  the people. And when that tumult of the populace gradually grew calm,
'6': >-
  the king addressed Vasiṣṭha, the bull among sages, saying: “As for the rite of
  Rāma’s anointing—together with all its requisite appurtenances—”
'7': >-
  “—all of that, venerable sir, you are fit to command today.” Hearing the word
  of the protector of the earth, Vasiṣṭha, the best of sages,
'8': >-
  issued his directives, in the king’s very presence, to the capable attendants
  standing in front with joined palms: “Provide gold and other treasures, the
  offerings, and all medicinal herbs as well;
'9': >-
  white garlands; parched grain (lājā); and separately honey and clarified
  butter; unwashed new garments; a chariot; and all weapons also;
'10': >-
  the fourfold army, and an elephant of auspicious marks; both the cāmara fans
  and the vyajana fans; the banner and the pale-white royal parasol;
'11': >-
  a hundred pitchers of śātakumbha-gold, radiant like fire; a complete bull with
  golden horns; and a tiger-skin;
'12': >-
  and whatever else, of any kind, is to be desired for the rite—let all of that
  be prepared. Present everything in the morning in the king’s fire-chamber
  (sacrificial hall).”
'13': >-
  “Let the gates of the inner apartments, and of the whole city as well, be
  worshipfully adorned with sandal and garlands, and with incense whose
  fragrance delights the senses.
'14': >-
  Let excellent food be prepared, rich in qualities, with curd and milk for
  moistening; and let there be for the twice-born a hundred thousand (portions),
  pure and abundant, according to their full desire.
'15': >-
  Having duly honored the foremost of brāhmaṇas, let these be given at dawn
  tomorrow—clarified butter, curd, parched grain (lājā), and plentiful gifts as
  sacrificial fees (dakṣiṇā) as well.
'16': >-
  At the very moment the sun has risen tomorrow, there shall be auspicious
  benedictions (svasti-vācana). Let brāhmaṇas be invited, and seats be made
  ready for them.
'17': >-
  Let festoons and banners be fastened up, and let the royal highway be
  sprinkled (with water). And let all the tālāpacaras (musicians/attendants) and
  the courtesans also be richly adorned,
'18': >-
  and, reaching the second enclosure, let them stand by the king’s palace. At
  the temples and sacred shrines, let there be food and offerings, together with
  gifts.
'19': >-
  And separately let those fit to present garlands be made ready. Let those with
  long swords and iguana-hide arm-guards be fully equipped, clad in clean and
  fine garments.
'20': >-
  Let brave men enter the great and noble royal courtyard.” Thus directing the
  brāhmaṇas, those rites there were duly set in order.
'21': >-
  And whatever remained to be done, they arranged, reporting it to the king;
  then, approaching the lord of men, they said, “It is accomplished.”
'22': >-
  Those two excellent brāhmaṇas, delighted and filled with joy, had acted
  exactly according to what was spoken. Thereupon the radiant king spoke to
  Sumantra:
'23': >-
  “Let Rāma, the self-possessed one, be brought quickly by you.” Sumantra,
  saying “So be it,” and accepting the king’s command,
'24': >-
  went and brought Rāma there in a chariot—Rāma, foremost among charioteers. And
  then, seated there with Daśaratha the king were,
'25': >-
  rulers from the eastern, northern, western, and southern regions; and mlecchas
  and āryas, and also others who dwelt in forests and mountain-lands.
'26': >-
  All of them attended upon him, as the gods attend upon Vāsava (Indra). And in
  their midst that royal sage shone like Vāsava among the Maruts.
'27': >-
  Standing upon the palace-terrace, Daśaratha beheld his son approaching—like
  the king of Gandharvas in appearance, and renowned in the world for his valor.
'28': >-
  Long-armed, of great might, moving with the gait of an intoxicated elephant;
  with a face lovely as the moonstone—Rāma, exceedingly pleasing to behold.
'29': >-
  By the grandeur of his form and his virtues, he stole away the eyes and hearts
  of men—like rainclouds that cool and gladden beings scorched by heat.
'30': >-
  The lord of men, gazing on him as he approached, could not be satiated with
  looking. And Sumantra, having made Rāghava alight from the excellent chariot,
'31': >-
  followed behind with joined palms as Rāma went toward his father. The delight
  of the Raghu line, hastening to see the king,
'32': >-
  swiftly ascended that palace, which was like the peak of Kailāsa. Approaching
  with joined palms, he bowed down near his father,
'33': >-
  and Rāma, uttering his own name, paid obeisance at his father’s feet. Seeing
  him bowed at his side, with palms joined in reverence, the king,
'34': >-
  took hold of his folded hands, drew him close, and embraced his beloved son.
  And the king commanded a splendid, lofty seat for Rāma, adorned with gold and
  gems.
'35': >-
  Having obtained that excellent seat, Rāghava illumined it—like the spotless
  sun at dawn illumining Meru by his own radiance.
'36': >-
  Thus made radiant by him, that assembly hall too shone forth, like the
  autumnal sky—clear with planets and stars—made beautiful by the moon.
'37': >-
  The king, beholding his beloved son, was wholly satisfied, as though he saw
  his own self adorned, standing upon a mirror’s surface.
'38': >-
  Addressing that son who sat well and properly placed, the king—best among
  fathers—spoke these words, like Kaśyapa to Indra:
'39': >-
  “In my eldest queen, who is like myself, you were born a son like myself. You
  have arisen as the foremost in virtues—my dear son Rāma;
'40': >-
  and through you these subjects have been won over and delighted by your own
  excellent qualities.
'41': >-
  “Therefore, under the auspicious conjunction of Puṣya, do you attain the
  princedom (the office of Prince Regent). By nature, and by the people’s own
  desire, you are judged to be endowed with virtue.
'42': >-
  Yet, though you are full of merit, out of affection, my son, I shall speak
  what is for your good: taking up humility again and again, be ever
  self-controlled, with senses conquered.
'43': >-
  Abandon the vices born of desire and anger; conduct yourself with proper
  behavior both when you are acting unseen (in private) and when you are acting
  in full view.
'44': >-
  Win over all—beginning with the ministers—and the subjects as well; and,
  having made ample stores in the treasury-house and the armory,
'45': >-
  he who protects the earth with subjects devoted and attached to him—his
  friends rejoice, as the immortals rejoice upon obtaining nectar.
'46': >-
  Therefore, my son, restrain yourself and act in just this manner.” Hearing
  that, the well-wishers of Rāma—who was dear to them and who worked for what
  was pleasing—
'47': >-
  came quickly and in haste, and reported the matter to Kauśalyā. She, foremost
  among women, gave orders to her dear attendants regarding gold, cows, and
  various jewels.
'48': >-
  Then Rāghava, having saluted the king, mounted his chariot and went to his own
  radiant mansion, honored by throngs of people.
'49': >-
  And those citizens too, having heard that word of the king—as though swiftly
  gaining a cherished boon—took leave of the lord of men, went to their homes,
  and, greatly rejoicing, worshipped the gods accordingly.
'50': >-
  Thus ends the third sarga, named “Instruction to the Princes
  (Putrānuśāsanam),” in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primordial epic.
