  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  thirty-fifth sarga, called “Tārā’s Conciliation (Tārā-samādhānam).”
'1': >-
  As Saumitrī (Lakṣmaṇa) spoke thus—blazing, as it were, with splendour—Tārā,
  whose face was like the lord of stars (the moon), addressed Lakṣmaṇa.
'2': >-
  “Lakṣmaṇa, one ought not to speak in this manner; he does not deserve harsh
  speech—especially to be heard from your mouth. He is the lord of the vānaras.”
'3': >-
  “Sugrīva is not ungrateful; he is neither deceitful nor cruel. Nor is the lord
  of the monkeys one who speaks untruth, O hero; nor is he crooked.”
'4': >-
  “Nor has this heroic monkey forgotten the service rendered. Sugrīva, O hero,
  has received aid from Rāma—aid which would be hard for others to accomplish in
  battle.”
'5': >-
  “By Rāma’s grace, O scorcher of foes, Sugrīva has obtained here imperishable
  kingship over the monkeys and renown as well—and he has regained Rumā, and me
  also.”
'6': >-
  “Having formerly lain in exceeding misery, and having now attained this
  supreme happiness, he does not recognise the right time—like the sage
  Viśvāmitra.”
'7': >-
  “For, Lakṣmaṇa, the righteous great sage Viśvāmitra, having become attached to
  Ghṛtācī, passed ten years—thinking not of the passage of time.”
'8': >-
  “He, though a knower of time and foremost among those who understand time, did
  not perceive that the time had come—Viśvāmitra of great splendour; how much
  more, then, an ordinary person.”
'9': >-
  “Since he has fallen under the law of the body, is wearied, and is not yet
  satiated with pleasures, Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma ought to pardon him here.”
'10': >-
  “And you, dear one, O Lakṣmaṇa, ought not to go under the sway of
  wrath—without understanding the true intention and without ascertaining the
  matter—rashly, like a common man.”
'11': >-
  “Men endowed with steadfastness—such as you, O bull among men—do not, without
  reflection, suddenly come under the control of anger.”
'12': >-
  “Therefore I entreat you, O knower of dharma, with my mind composed, for
  Sugrīva’s sake. Let this impetuous agitation, born of great wrath, be
  abandoned.”
'13': >-
  “My thought is this: for the sake of what is dear to Rāma, Sugrīva would give
  up Rumā, and me, and Aṅgada, and the kingdom, and riches, grain, and cattle.”
'14': >-
  “Sugrīva will reunite Rāghava with Sītā, after slaying that lowest of
  rākṣasas—like the moon being brought together with Rohiṇī.”
'15': >-
  “In Laṅkā, indeed, there are said to be a hundred crores of thousands of
  rākṣasas; and moreover thirty-six thousands, and hundreds besides.”
'16': >-
  “Without first slaying those formidable, invincible, shape-shifting rākṣasas,
  Rāvaṇa—by whom that Maithilī was carried off—cannot be slain.”
'17': >-
  “Those cannot be slain in battle by one who is without assistance, O
  Lakṣmaṇa—nor can cruel-deeded Rāvaṇa, especially, be slain by Sugrīva
  (alone).”
'18': >-
  “Thus did Vālī declare; for that lord of the monkeys was well-informed. But
  the full tradition is not clear to me; I speak only from what I heard from
  him.”
'19': >-
  “Indeed, for the purpose of having you as an ally, the foremost of monkeys
  have been sent—to bring, for the battle, very many mighty leaders among the
  vānaras.”
'20': >-
  “Awaiting those valiant ones of very great strength, this lord of the monkeys
  does not yet set out—for the accomplishment of Rāghava’s purpose.”
'21': >-
  “That excellent arrangement which Sugrīva formerly made, O Saumitrī—today it
  must be fulfilled: all those powerful vānaras must arrive.”
'22': >-
  “Thousands upon thousands of koṭis of bears, and hundreds upon hundreds of
  long-tailed monkeys—today they will come to you. Destroy your anger, O subduer
  of foes. And there are many koṭis besides, O scion of Kakutstha, of monkeys of
  blazing splendour.”
'23': >-
  “Seeing this face of yours, and beholding your eyes—blood-red with anger—the
  noble women of the monkeys do not attain peace; for all of them, recalling
  their first fear, remain apprehensive.”
'24': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fifth sarga, called “Tārā’s Conciliation,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
