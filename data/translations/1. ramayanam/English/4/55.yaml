  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the fifty-fifth
  sarga, called “Prāyopaveśa (the resolve to fast unto death).”
'1': >-
  Hearing Hanumān’s speech—humble, consonant with dharma, and filled with due
  reverence toward one’s lord—Aṅgada spoke these words.
'2': >-
  Steadfastness, purity of self and mind, compassion, and uprightness—together
  with valor and fortitude—are not found in Sugrīva.
'3': >-
  He who, while his elder brother yet lives, accepts for himself that brother’s
  beloved chief queen as wife—taking as “rightful” even one who is as a mother
  by dharma—such a man is loathsome.
'4': >-
  How can he know dharma—he by whose wicked brother, when he had been sent forth
  to battle, the mouth of the cave was closed?
'5': >-
  Rāghava, the illustrious one—who, having clasped hands in truth and performed
  his deed—is forgotten by him; whose good act would such a man ever remember?
'6': >-
  Not out of fear of adharma, but out of fear of Lakṣmaṇa alone, he commanded
  that Sītā be searched for here; how then can there be any dharma in him?
'7': >-
  In that sinful man—ungrateful, with memory broken, and fickle of soul—who
  among the noble would ever place trust, and especially one born in a good
  lineage?
'8': >-
  Whether a son be established in the kingdom as possessing virtues or even
  without virtues, how will Sugrīva keep me alive—me, born in the line of his
  enemy?
'9': >-
  With counsel divided, having offended, and with strength impaired—how indeed
  shall I, reaching Kiṣkindhā, live, weak and friendless like one without
  refuge?
'10': >-
  That deceitful, cruel, and merciless Sugrīva, for the sake of the kingdom,
  would subject me to restraint—by secret punishment and by bonds.
'11': >-
  Rather than bondage and the humiliation that would be mine, better for me is
  prāyopaveśa (fasting unto death). Let all permit me; let the monkeys go back
  to their homes.
'12': >-
  I promise you: I shall not go to the city. Here alone I shall sit in the fast
  unto death; for me, death itself is better.
'13': >-
  With due salutations first, the king is to be informed of my welfare; and with
  due salutations first, the two mighty Rāghavas also are to be addressed.
'14': >-
  Sugrīva, lord of the monkeys—who is my father’s younger brother—should be
  spoken to; and my mother Rumā too should be asked of her health and
  well-being.
'15': >-
  And you ought to console my mother Tārā as well; by nature she is fond of her
  son, compassionate, and a woman of austerity.
'16': >-
  Hearing that I have perished here, she will surely abandon life. Having spoken
  words to this extent, and having saluted those elders,
'17': >-
  Aṅgada entered upon the ground, weeping, downcast in heart, and lay down upon
  darbha-grass. As he lay there, the best of the monkeys, weeping,
'18': >-
  released hot tears from their eyes in grief—censuring Sugrīva and praising
  Vāli.
'19': >-
  Surrounding Aṅgada, they all resolved to sit in prāya (fasting unto death).
  Understanding the words of Vāli’s son, those bull-like monkeys
'20': >-
  all sipped water and, facing east, sat down upon darbha-grass with their tips
  to the south, resting on the northern bank.
'21': >-
  Those foremost of the monkeys, desiring to die, deemed this course
  fitting—speaking of Rāma’s exile to the forest and of Daśaratha’s death,
'22': >-
  and of the slaughter at Jana-sthāna, and of the slaying of Jaṭāyus; and of the
  abduction of Vaidehī, and likewise of Vāli’s death; and, as they spoke of
  Rāma’s wrath, fear came upon the monkeys.
'23': >-
  With many monkeys lying down there—like mountain-peaks resembling mighty
  crags—the mountain seemed to have its caves resounding, and became greatly
  tumultuous, like the sky thundered through by rain-clouds.
'24': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fifth sarga of the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa in the Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the sacred, ancient epic, entitled “Prāyopaveśa.”
