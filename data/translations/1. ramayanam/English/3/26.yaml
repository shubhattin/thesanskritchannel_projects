  Now, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  twenty-sixth canto, named “The Slaying of Dūṣaṇa and Others.”
'1': >-
  But Dūṣaṇa, the mighty-armed one, seeing his own army being struck down,
  issued commands—(calling forth) those of dreadful speed and difficult to
  assail.
'2': >-
  (He commanded) five thousand rākṣasas, who never turned back from battle.
  Those (warriors), with spears, javelins, swords, showers of rocks, and even
  with trees,
'3': >-
  and with uninterrupted torrents of arrows, poured (their missiles) upon him
  from every side. That mighty rain of trees and rocks was life-destroying.
'4': >-
  The righteous-souled Rāghava received it with keen shafts; and, having taken
  upon himself that rain, he stood as though an unshaken bull, as if with eyes
  half-closed against it.
'5': >-
  Rāma was seized with supreme wrath, intent on the destruction of all the
  rākṣasas. Then, possessed by anger, he blazed as though aflame with his own
  splendour.
'6': >-
  With arrows he showered the army on every side, together with Dūṣaṇa. Then the
  commander of the host, the enraged Dūṣaṇa—destroyer of foes—
'7': >-
  checked Rāghava with arrows like thunderbolts. Thereupon Rāma, greatly
  incensed, with a razor-headed shaft cut his great bow in battle, and (then)
  with four (arrows) struck down the four horses.
'8': >-
  And having slain the horses with sharp arrows, with a half-moon-headed shaft
  he cut off the charioteer’s head; and with three (arrows) he pierced that
  rākṣasa in the chest.
'9': >-
  And he, his bow cut, his chariot lost, his horses slain, and his charioteer
  slain,
'10': >-
  seized a terrible iron club like a mountain-peak, hair-raising to behold,
  bound about with golden bands, a smasher of the hosts of the gods.
'11': >-
  It was studded with sharp iron spikes, stained and darkened with the blood of
  enemies; its touch was like that of a thunderbolt; it could shatter an enemy’s
  gate-tower.
'12': >-
  Grasping that club in battle, resembling a great serpent, Dūṣaṇa—of cruel
  deeds, a prowler of the night—sprang upon Rāma.
'13': >-
  As Dūṣaṇa rushed upon him, Rāghava with two arrows severed both his arms,
  adorned with armlets,
'14': >-
  and the great-bodied one, thus deprived, fell upon the forefront of the
  battlefield; and the club, from the hand that had been cut off, fell in front
  like Indra’s banner.
'15': >-
  With both hands hewn away and scattered, Dūṣaṇa fell to the earth like a
  mighty elephant, spirited and great, whose tusks have been broken off.
'16': >-
  Seeing Dūṣaṇa fallen on the ground, slain in battle, all beings honoured
  Kakutstha, crying, “Well done! Well done!”
'17': >-
  Meanwhile, three leaders who marched at the head of the army, enraged and as
  though bound by the noose of Death, rushed together upon Rāma.
'18': >-
  (They were) Mahākapāla, Sthūlākṣa, and Pramāthī of great strength. Mahākapāla
  the rākṣasa, lifting up a huge spear,
'19': >-
  Sthūlākṣa taking a javelin, and Pramāthī an axe—seeing them even as they
  charged, Rāghava with sharp arrows
'20': >-
  received those who had come near, as though welcoming arriving guests, with
  keen-pointed shafts. The delight of the Raghus cut off Mahākapāla’s head,
'21': >-
  and with countless floods of arrows he crushed Pramāthī; and Sthūlākṣa’s large
  eyes he filled full with arrows.
'22': >-
  He fell slain upon the ground like the trunk of a great tree. And Dūṣaṇa’s
  followers—five thousand—Rāma, enraged, in an instant,
'23': >-
  having slain them with his arrows, sent them to the abode of Yama. Hearing
  that Dūṣaṇa had been slain, and with him those who followed in his footsteps,
'24': >-
  Khara, wrathful, issued orders to mighty leaders of the army: “Here in battle
  Dūṣaṇa, together with his followers, has been destroyed.
'25': >-
  With a great host, fight Rāma, that mere man! With weapons of many kinds and
  forms, slay him, all you rākṣasas!”
'26': >-
  So saying, Khara, furious, himself rushed straight at Rāma. (Along with him
  came) Śyenagāmī, Pṛthugrīva, Yajñaśatru, and Vihaṅgama;
'27': >-
  Durjaya, Karavīrākṣa, Paruṣa, Kālākārmuka; Hemamālī, Mahāmālī, Sarpāsya, and
  Rudhirāśana.
'28': >-
  These twelve, of great valour—commanders of the forces with their troops—ran
  at Rāma alone, releasing excellent arrows.
'29': >-
  Then the radiant Rāma, with arrows that shone like fire and were adorned as
  with golden thunderbolts, struck down the remainder of that army.
'30': >-
  Those shafts with golden feathers, like smokey flames of fire, smote those
  rākṣasas as thunderbolts fell great trees.
'31': >-
  Of the rākṣasas, a hundred did Rāma slay with a single hundred (arrows) in
  that scattering; and a thousand he slew with a single thousand, upon the
  forefront of battle.
'32': >-
  With armour and ornaments shattered, with bows cut and broken, the
  night-rangers fell upon the earth, smeared with blood.
'33': >-
  With loosened hair, fallen in battle and drenched in blood, the whole earth
  lay spread out like a great sacrificial altar strewn with kuśa-grass.
'34': >-
  At that very moment the dreadful forest, with the rākṣasas slain, became like
  hell—muddy with flesh and blood.
'35': >-
  Fourteen thousand rākṣasas of terrible deeds were slain by Rāma alone—by a
  single man, a human, fighting on foot.
'36': >-
  Of all that army, only Khara the great chariot-warrior remained, and the
  rākṣasa Triśiras—and Rāma, the slayer of foes.
'37': >-
  The rest—great heroes, all dreadful and hard to withstand—were slain upon the
  forefront of the battlefield by him, Lakṣmaṇa’s elder brother.
'38': >-
  Then Khara, beholding in that great combat his fearsome host slain by Rāma,
  mightier than they, advanced upon Rāma in his great chariot, like Indra
  approaching with uplifted thunderbolt.
'39': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-sixth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the sacred,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, named “The Slaying of
  Dūṣaṇa and Others.”
