  Now, in the illustrious Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Sundara-kanda, is the
  fortieth chapter, named “The Despatching of Hanuman.”
'1': >-
  Having heard the words of that great-souled son of the Wind, Sita—like unto
  the daughter of a god—spoke words that were for her own welfare.
'2': >-
  On beholding thee, O Vanara, a speaker of beloved and pleasing words, I
  rejoice—like the earth, whose crop is but half-grown, rejoices on obtaining
  rain.
'3': >-
  So that I may touch that tiger among men (Rama) with these limbs worn down by
  sorrow, do thou show compassion unto me and act in such a manner.
'4': >-
  And, O foremost of the hosts of monkeys, do thou give to Rama a token of
  recognition: how, in anger, he hurled a clod (of earth), and with that missile
  struck the crow, destroying but one of its eyes.
'5': >-
  The tilaka of red arsenic (manahshila) was placed on the side of his cheek; if
  that tilaka has been lost by thee, then indeed thou shouldst bid him remember
  it.
'6': >-
  How indeed dost thou, O mighty one—like unto Indra or Varuna—suppose that the
  valiant Rama can endure that Sita has been carried off, while she dwells in
  the midst of Rakshasas?
'7': >-
  This divine crest-jewel has been well preserved by me; on seeing this, O
  sinless one, I shall rejoice in adversity, even as I rejoice on seeing thee.
'8': >-
  This auspicious jewel, born of the waters, is sent forth by me unto thee;
  beyond this, longing only for sorrow, I shall not be able to live.
'9': >-
  Unendurable are the sufferings, and the words that cleave the heart; yet, for
  thy sake, I endure my dwelling together with the Rakshasas.
'10': >-
  For a month, O slayer of foes, I shall hold on to life; beyond a month I shall
  not live, O prince, being bereft of thee.
'11': >-
  This king of Rakshasas is terrible, and his gaze upon me is not gentle; and
  hearing of thee as one who is despondent, I could not live even for an
  instant.
'12': >-
  Hearing the compassionate words of Vaidehi, spoken with tears, then Hanuman,
  the son of Maruta, of great splendor, spoke.
'13': >-
  Rama is free from grief on thy account, O lady; by truth I swear this unto
  thee. But if Rama were overpowered by sorrow, then Lakshmana would burn with
  anguish.
'14': >-
  Thou hast been seen, though with difficulty; this is no time for lamentation.
  This very moment, O fair one, thou shalt behold the end of thy sorrows.
'15': >-
  Those two tiger-like heroes among men, the blameless princes—made courageous
  by the sight of thee—will reduce Lanka to ashes.
'16': >-
  Having slain in battle that Rakshasa, Ravana, together with his kinsmen, the
  two Raghavas will lead thee, O large-eyed one, back to thine own city.
'17': >-
  But that Rama may know, O blameless lady, a token of recognition—one that will
  further beget joy—thou shouldst give such a thing to him.
'18': >-
  She said: “Alas, an excellent token of recognition has indeed been given by
  me. For Rama, seeing this ornament with careful attention—this alone is (the
  proof).”
'19': >-
  O Hanuman, thy word will be trustworthy, O hero. Then the illustrious foremost
  of the Plavagas took that excellent jewel.
'20': >-
  Bowing to the goddess with his head, he set about departing. Seeing that
  leader of the monkey-host, whose spirit was roused for a great leap,
'21': >-
  the daughter of Janaka spoke as he increased his speed—her face filled with
  tears, wretched, her speech choked and trembling with sobs:
'22': >-
  “O Hanuman, do thou tell the lion-like brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, and
  Sugriva also with his ministers—all of them—that they are without illness.
'23': >-
  And in what manner that mighty-armed Raghava may deliver me from this
  enclosure of the waters of sorrow—do thou rightly counsel and settle this.”
'24': >-
  “And this fierce rush of my sorrow, and the reviling by these Rakshasas—do
  thou, having gone into Rama’s presence, relate it. And may thy journey be
  auspicious, O foremost hero among monkeys.”
'25': >-
  That monkey, having received from the princess the matter that was to be
  reported, felt his purpose fulfilled and his heart greatly gladdened. Then,
  seeing that little yet remained to be done, he mentally set forth toward the
  northern quarter.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the fortieth chapter, named “The Despatching of Hanuman,” in the
  Sundara-kanda of the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, the Adi-kavya.
