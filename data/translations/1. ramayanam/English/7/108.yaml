  Now begins, in the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-eighth sarga, entitled “The Injunctions to Vibhīṣaṇa and
  Others.”
'1': >-
  Urged on by Rāma’s command, those messengers, swift in prowess, went quickly
  to Mathurā, and did not make any halt upon the road.
'2': >-
  Reaching Mathurā in three days and nights, they then related to Śatrughna,
  truly and in due order, the whole of that matter.
'3': >-
  They told him of Lakṣmaṇa’s abandonment, of Rāghava’s vow, of the consecration
  of the two sons, and likewise of the citizens’ following after him.
'4': >-
  They told how that delightful city for Kuśa, on the banks by the Vindhya
  mountains, was founded by the wise Rāma and made to bear the name Kuśāvatī;
  and how the fair city called Śrāvastī was established for Lava.
'5': >-
  Having made Ayodhyā desolate, Rāghava and Bharata—both great car-warriors—set
  themselves in readiness to depart for heaven.
'6': >-
  Having swiftly reported all this to the great-souled Śatrughna, those
  messengers then ceased, and said, “Hasten, O king!”
'7': >-
  Hearing that a dreadful calamity—destruction of the royal line—had come close
  at hand, he summoned the ministers of state and also the golden-hued priest
  (his purohita).
'8': >-
  To them all, the delight of the Raghus related everything exactly as it had
  occurred, and also the reversal of his own fortunes that was about to be,
  together with his brothers.
'9': >-
  Then the heroic ruler consecrated his two sons: Subāhu obtained Mathurā, and
  Śatrughāti obtained Vaidiśa.
'10': >-
  Dividing that Mathurā-host into two portions for his two sons, and duly
  arranging the treasury and supplies, the king established them firmly.
'11': >-
  Having installed Subāhu in Mathurā and Śatrughāti in Vaidiśa, that Rāghava
  then set out for Ayodhyā in a single chariot.
'12': >-
  He beheld the great-souled Rāma, blazing like fire, clad in fine linen
  garments, together with imperishable sages.
'13': >-
  Having saluted Rāma, with joined palms and senses restrained, he spoke words
  befitting one who knows dharma, pondering dharma alone.
'14': >-
  “Having performed the consecration of my two sons, O scion of the Raghus, know
  me, O king, to be resolved upon following after you.”
'15': >-
  “There is nothing else to be said, and no command is needed from you, O hero;
  I desire to be regarded—especially by one such as I—as in attendance upon
  you.”
'16': >-
  Knowing that steadfast resolve of his, free from cowardice, the joy of the
  Raghus—Rāma—said to Śatrughna, “So be it.”
'17': >-
  At the conclusion of that utterance, the shape-changing Vānara hosts, and also
  companies of bears and Rākṣasas, assembled in great numbers.
'18': >-
  With Sugrīva at their head, all of them came together, eager to behold that
  Rāma who stood turned toward heaven.
'19': >-
  Sons of the gods, sons of sages, and likewise the sons of Gandharvas—knowing
  that Rāma’s departure was at hand—all of them assembled there.
'20': >-
  All those Vānaras and Rākṣasas, having saluted Rāma, said: “We have come, O
  king, resolved upon following after you.”
'21': >-
  “If, O Rāma, you should go without us, O best of men, then, as though you had
  raised Yama’s rod, we would be struck down by you.”
'22': Thus addressed, that descendant of Kakutstha, smiling, replied, “So be it.”
'23': >-
  Meanwhile, Sugrīva also, of great might, having bowed in due manner to the
  hero Rāma, prepared to make a supplication.
'24': >-
  “Having consecrated the hero Aṅgada, I have come, O lord of men. Know me, O
  king, to be resolved upon following after you.”
'25': >-
  Hearing those words, Rāma—best of those who delight others—then spoke to the
  lord of Vānaras, reflecting on the friendship between them.
'26': >-
  “Friend, listen, Sugrīva: without you I would not go either to the world of
  the gods or to that supreme, great abode.”
'27': >-
  Then the illustrious one spoke to Vibhīṣaṇa, lord of Rākṣasas: “So long as
  people endure, so long, O Vibhīṣaṇa—O Rākṣasa lord of great valor—dwelling in
  Laṅkā, you shall endure.”
'28': >-
  “So long as the moon and the sun endure, so long as the earth stands, and so
  long as my story is current in the world, so long shall your sovereignty
  remain here.”
'29': >-
  “I have instructed you in the spirit of friendship; it is for you to carry out
  my command. Protect your subjects according to dharma; you ought not speak any
  further in reply.”
'30': >-
  “And I wish to say yet something more, O lord of Rākṣasas of great
  understanding.”
'31': >-
  “Worship unceasingly the Lord of the world, the divinity of the Ikṣvāku
  line—ever to be worshipped by all the gods, together with Indra.”
'32': >-
  “So be it,” Vibhīṣaṇa accepted Rāma’s words—he, the king among the foremost of
  Rākṣasas—keeping in mind the command of Rāghava.
'33': >-
  Having thus spoken to him, the descendant of Kakutstha then said to Hanumān:
  “You have set your mind upon life; do not violate your vow.”
'34': >-
  “So long as my deeds and story shall circulate in the world, O lord of
  monkeys, so long remain, well-pleased, abiding by my word.”
'35': >-
  Thus addressed by great-souled Rāghava, Hanumān, attaining the highest joy,
  made his reply in submission.
'36': >-
  “So long as your purifying story shall move about in the world, so long shall
  I remain upon the earth, following your command.”
'37': >-
  And having thus addressed Jāmbavān—the aged one, the son of Brahmā—together
  with Mainda and Dvivida, and five others along with Jāmbavān: “So long as Kali
  has not arrived, so long live always.”
'38': >-
  Having thus spoken, the descendant of Kakutstha said to all those bears and
  Vānaras: “So be it; go with me, as you desire.”
'39': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-eighth sarga in the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Injunctions to Vibhīṣaṇa
  and Others.”
