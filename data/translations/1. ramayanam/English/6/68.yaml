  Now begins the sixty-eighth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, named “Rāvaṇa’s Lament.”
'1': >-
  Seeing Kumbhakarṇa slain by the great-souled Rāghava, the rākṣasas reported
  the matter to Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas.
'2': >-
  “O King, he—terrible like Death itself—engaged in the work of Death; having
  routed the monkey host and having devoured the vānaras,
'3': >-
  after raging for but a brief while, was stilled by the splendor of Rāma; with
  his body half-entered into the ocean, dreadful to behold,
'4': >-
  his nose and ears hewn off, and blood streaming forth, he, mountain-like,
  blocked with his very body the gateway of Laṅkā.
'5': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa, your brother, tormented by the arrows of the son of Kakutstha,
  lies there with his cheeks shattered and torn open, like a tree burned in a
  forest-conflagration.”
'6': >-
  Hearing that mighty Kumbhakarṇa had been slain in battle, Rāvaṇa, scorched by
  grief, swooned—and fell to the ground.
'7': >-
  Hearing that their uncle had been slain, Devāntaka and Narāntaka, and Triśiras
  and Atikāya, wept, afflicted with sorrow.
'8': >-
  Hearing that their brother had been slain by Rāma of unwearied deeds, Mahodara
  and Mahāpārśva were overwhelmed by grief.
'9': >-
  Then, with difficulty regaining consciousness, that foremost of
  rākṣasas—wretched from Kumbhakarṇa’s death—lamented, his senses bewildered.
'10': >-
  “Alas, O hero! O slayer of the pride of foes! O mighty Kumbhakarṇa! Leaving me
  behind—by the decree of fate—you have gone to the abode of Yama!
'11': >-
  Without extracting the dart embedded in me, O mighty one—without striking down
  the enemy host all by yourself—how can you depart, abandoning me?
'12': >-
  Now indeed I am as one who is no more—for that arm of mine has fallen, that
  right arm, relying upon which I feared neither gods nor asuras.
'13': >-
  How has such a hero—crusher of the pride of devas and dānavas, like the fire
  of Time at the world’s end—been slain today in battle by Rāghava?
'14': >-
  He whom even the crushing of the thunderbolt could never always bring to
  calamity—how is it that you, pained by Rāma’s arrows, lie prostrate upon the
  earth?
'15': >-
  There stand in the sky the hosts of gods together with the ṛṣis; seeing you
  slain in battle, they raise cries of triumph, delighted.
'16': >-
  Surely, even today, the vānaras—exultant, their aim achieved—will storm here
  on every side the ramparts and the gates of Laṅkā!
'17': >-
  I have no concern for sovereignty; what shall I do with Sītā? Bereft of
  Kumbhakarṇa, I have no desire to live.
'18': >-
  If I do not slay in battle Rāghava, the killer of my brother, then surely
  death is better for me—this living would be futile.
'19': >-
  This very day I shall go to that realm where my younger brother has gone; for
  I cannot endure to live even for a moment, having cast away my brothers.
'20': >-
  The gods will surely mock me when they see one who has previously wronged
  them; how shall I conquer Indra, O Kumbhakarṇa, now that you are slain?
'21': >-
  Thus has that auspicious counsel of Vibhīṣaṇa come upon me—because, through
  ignorance, I did not accept the advice of that great-souled one.
'22': >-
  From Vibhīṣaṇa’s words—(foretelling) the fall of Kumbhakarṇa and Prahasta—this
  destruction has arisen; it is dreadful and fills me with shame.
'23': >-
  This grief-giving consequence of my deed has come upon me: that I cast out
  Vibhīṣaṇa, the righteous and illustrious one.
'24': >-
  Thus, with his inmost soul tossed in many ways, wretched in mind, lamenting
  greatly for Kumbhakarṇa, Daśānana too fell down, grievously afflicted, when he
  knew that that younger brother of his—an enemy of Indra—had been slain.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-eighth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the sacred, glorious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Ādikāvya, entitled “Rāvaṇa’s Lament.”
