  Now begins the seventy-fifth canto of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Bharata’s Oath.”
'1': >-
  Then the valiant Bharata, after long lying senseless, rose up and regained
  consciousness; and with both eyes filled with tears, he looked upon his
  mother, wretched and grief-stricken.
'2': >-
  Bharata, in the midst of the ministers, reproached his mother: “I have never
  desired the kingdom—nor have I ever taken counsel with my mother for such a
  thing.”
'3': >-
  “I know nothing at all of this consecration to kingship that was examined and
  settled upon by the king; for I was dwelling far away in another land,
  together with Śatrughna.”
'4': >-
  “I know nothing of the great-souled Rāma’s dwelling in the forest, nor of
  Lakṣmaṇa’s banishment, nor of Sītā’s—how it came to pass.”
'5': >-
  Even as that great-souled Bharata cried out thus, Kausalyā, understanding the
  sound of his lamentation, said this to Sumitrā:
'6': >-
  “Bharata, the son of Kaikeyī—who is bent on a cruel deed—has come. I wish to
  see that far-seeing Bharata.”
'7': >-
  Having spoken thus to Sumitrā, she—pale, clothed in soiled garments, trembling
  and scarcely conscious—set out for the place where Bharata was.
'8': >-
  Then Bharata too—Rāma’s younger brother—together with Śatrughna, set out at
  that time for Kausalyā’s dwelling.
'9': >-
  Thereupon Śatrughna and Bharata, seeing Kausalyā in misery, embraced
  her—afflicted with grief, fallen down, and having lost consciousness.
'10': >-
  Weeping as she wept, and coming close to the noble lady, the high-minded
  Kausalyā, exceedingly distressed, spoke these words to Bharata:
'11': >-
  “This kingdom—desired by you—has been obtained, free of thorns and obstacles.
  Alas, by Kaikeyī’s swift and cruel act it has been secured!”
'12': >-
  “Having sent my son away—clad in bark garments—to dwell in the forest, what
  excellence does Kaikeyī see therein, she of cruel vision?”
'13': >-
  “Kaikeyī ought quickly to send me also to where my son of great renown, he of
  golden navel, now dwells.”
'14': >-
  “Or else I myself, with Sumitrā as my companion, placing the sacred fire-rite
  before me, will set forth to where Rāghava has gone.”
'15': >-
  “Or indeed, today you yourself should take me there—where that tiger among
  men, my son, is performing his austerities.”
'16': >-
  “Behold, through her, this wide kingdom—heaped with riches and grain, fully
  furnished with elephants, horses, and chariots—has been handed over to you.”
'17': >-
  Thus assailed with many such harsh and cruel words, the blameless Bharata was
  deeply shaken—like one whose wound is pierced by a needle.
'18': >-
  Then, his mind in turmoil, he fell at her feet; wailing in many ways, he again
  became senseless; and when he recovered consciousness, he stood there.
'19': >-
  As she lamented thus, Bharata—hands folded in reverence—spoke this to
  Kausalyā, who was enveloped by manifold sorrows:
'20': >-
  “Noble lady, why do you reproach me—one who is ignorant of this and free from
  sin? You know well my abundant and steadfast affection for Rāghava.”
'21': >-
  “May that man’s understanding, following the injunctions of the śāstras, never
  be his—he who is firm in truth, best among the virtuous, and whose consent my
  revered brother has followed.”
'22': >-
  “Let such a man become the servant of the wicked, let him make water facing
  the sun, and let him strike with his foot a sleeping cow—he whose consent my
  noble brother has followed.”
'23': >-
  “Having made a servant useless by compelling him to do a great task—whatever
  unrighteousness there is in that, let it be his—whoever’s consent my revered
  brother has followed.”
'24': >-
  “Let that sin of betraying a king who protects his subjects like his own
  children come upon him—he whose consent my noble brother has followed.”
'25': >-
  “Having taken the sixth part as tribute, and yet failing to protect the
  subjects—whatever unrighteousness is in that, let it be his—he whose consent
  my revered brother has followed.”
'26': >-
  “Having promised the sacrificial fee at an offering to ascetics, and then
  deceiving them—let that sin be his—he whose consent my noble brother has
  followed.”
'27': >-
  “In battle crowded with elephants, horses, and chariots, and filled with
  weapons—may he never perform the dharma of the righteous—he whose consent my
  revered brother has followed.”
'28': >-
  “The subtle meaning of śāstra, taught with effort by a wise man—let that
  wicked-souled one destroy it—he whose consent my noble brother has followed.”
'29': >-
  “May he never behold that mighty-armed one, radiant like the moon and sun,
  seated in sovereignty—he whose consent my noble brother has followed.”
'30': >-
  “Let that merciless man eat in vain pāyasa, kṛsara, and the flesh of goats;
  and let him even slight the venerable elders—he whose consent my revered
  brother has followed.”
'31': >-
  “Let him touch cows with his foot, revile his elders with his own mouth, and
  utterly betray his friends—he whose consent my noble brother has followed.”
'32': >-
  “Whatever slander is spoken in private, out of trust, between people—let that
  wicked-souled one disclose it—he whose consent my revered brother has
  followed.”
'33': >-
  “Let him be one who does not act, who is ungrateful, who has abandoned
  self-control, and who is shameless; let him become hated in the world—he whose
  consent my noble brother has followed.”
'34': >-
  “Though surrounded in his own house by sons, wife, and servants, let him eat
  delicacies alone—he whose consent my revered brother has followed.”
'35': >-
  “Without obtaining a suitable wife, let him die childless, and without
  accomplishing righteous rites—he whose consent my noble brother has followed.”
'36': >-
  “Afflicted with sorrow among his wives, let him not behold his own lineage
  continued; and without attaining the full span of life, let him perish—he
  whose consent my revered brother has followed.”
'37': >-
  “Whatever sin is declared in the slaying of a king, a woman, a child, or an
  old man, and whatever sin there is in abandoning dependents—let him incur that
  sin.”
'38': >-
  “With lac, with honeyed flesh, with iron, and with poison—let him ever
  maintain attendants by such means—he whose consent my noble brother has
  followed.”
'39': >-
  “When battle is joined and fearsome from the enemy’s side, fleeing away—let
  him be slain—he whose consent my revered brother has followed.”
'40': >-
  “With a skull-bowl in his hand, roaming the earth, clad in rags, begging like
  a madman—let him become such—he whose consent my noble brother has followed.”
'41': >-
  “Let him be addicted to drink, ever attached to women and to dice, and
  overcome by desire and anger—he whose consent my revered brother has
  followed.”
'42': >-
  “Though his mind may incline toward dharma, let him practice adharma; and let
  him become one upon whom rain falls at the wrong season—he whose consent my
  noble brother has followed.”
'43': >-
  “Let his accumulated wealth—varied and amassed by thousands—be plundered by
  thieves—he whose consent my noble brother has followed.”
'44': >-
  “Whatever sin is ascribed to one who sleeps through both twilights—let that
  sin be his—he whose consent my revered brother has followed.”
'45': >-
  “Whatever sin belongs to one who makes fire-gifts unlawfully, whatever sin
  belongs to one who violates the teacher’s bed, and whatever sin belongs to
  betraying a friend—let him incur that sin.”
'46': >-
  “Let him never perform service due to the gods and the Pitṛs, nor to mother
  and father—he whose consent my noble brother has followed.”
'47': >-
  “From the world of the righteous, from the fame of the righteous, and from
  deeds approved by the virtuous—let him fall away, quickly, even today—he whose
  consent my revered brother has followed.”
'48': >-
  “Casting off service to his mother, let him stand fixed in what is
  profitless—though long-armed and broad-chested—he whose consent my noble
  brother has followed.”
'49': >-
  “Let him have many sons, yet be poor, afflicted with fever and disease; and
  let him ever be tormented by continual distress—he whose consent my revered
  brother has followed.”
'50': >-
  “To the wretched who look upward with hope, to those who seek aid—let him make
  their hopes false, from quarter to quarter—he whose consent my noble brother
  has followed.”
'51': >-
  “Let him ever delight in deceit; let him be harsh, slanderous, impure; let him
  be fearful of the king, yet unrighteous at heart—he whose consent my revered
  brother has followed.”
'52': >-
  “Let that wicked-souled one transgress against his virtuous wife, bathed after
  her courses and observing the proper season—he whose consent my noble brother
  has followed.”
'53': >-
  “Abandoning his lawful wife, let him associate with others’ wives—foolish,
  delighting in dharma cast away—he whose consent my revered brother has
  followed.”
'54': >-
  “Whatever evil deed belongs to a brāhmaṇa who has lost his offspring—let him
  incur that very deed—he whose consent my noble brother has followed.”
'55': >-
  “The sin that belongs to one who corrupts drinking water, and likewise to one
  who administers poison—let him alone obtain that—he whose consent my revered
  brother has followed.”
'56': >-
  “Let him, with polluted senses, obstruct the worship prepared for a brāhmaṇa;
  and let him milk a cow that has a young calf—he whose consent my noble brother
  has followed.”
'57': >-
  “When one is tormented by thirst and water is at hand, let him deceive and
  cheat that person; and let him obtain the sin that arises thereby—he whose
  consent my noble brother has followed.”
'58': >-
  “When devotees are disputing, and he merely stands by watching from the
  roadside—let him be yoked with that sin—he whose consent my noble brother has
  followed.”
'59': >-
  Thus comforting Kausalyā—deprived of husband and son—Bharata, the king’s son,
  himself afflicted with sorrow, fell down again.
'60': >-
  Then, as Bharata—grief-stricken and senseless—kept swearing such dreadful
  oaths, Kausalyā spoke these words to him:
'61': >-
  “My sorrow, my son, increases yet again; for by swearing such oaths you are,
  as it were, taking away my very life-breaths.”
'62': >-
  “By good fortune, you—with Lakṣmaṇa—have not deviated from dharma. Dear child,
  true to your pledge, you shall attain the worlds of the righteous.”
'63': >-
  So saying, she drew Bharata—devoted to his brother—onto her lap; and embracing
  that mighty-armed one, she wept, overwhelmed with grief.
'64': >-
  As that great-souled one lamented, afflicted with sorrow, through delusion and
  the crushing force of grief his mind became utterly confounded.
'65': >-
  While he lay unconscious—his reason lost—fallen upon the ground, babbling
  incoherently and again and again heaving long sighs, the night passed for her
  in that sorrow of his.
'66': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-fifth canto in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “Bharata’s Oath.”
