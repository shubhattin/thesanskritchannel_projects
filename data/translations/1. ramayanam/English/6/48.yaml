  Then, in the blessed Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-eighth chapter, named “The Consolation of Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Beholding her lord struck down, and Lakṣmaṇa also, the mighty-armed, Sītā
  lamented exceedingly, uttering piteous cries, worn away by grief.
'2': >-
  “Those who, skilled in reading marks, used to tell me, ‘You will have sons,
  and you will not be a widow’—today, with Rāma slain, all those ‘knowing’ ones
  are proved false-speakers.”
'3': >-
  “Those who—being sacrificers, and those officiating at sacrifices—declared me
  to be a chief queen and a wedded wife: today, with Rāma slain, all those
  ‘knowing’ ones are proved false-speakers.”
'4': >-
  “Those who understand the condition of the wives of heroic kings, honoured by
  their husbands: today, with Rāma slain, all those ‘knowing’ ones are proved
  false-speakers.”
'5': >-
  “Those Brāhmaṇas, versed in the auspicious signs and learned in traditional
  lore, who told me at the ceremony of hearing (the auspicious indications) that
  I was blessed: today, with Rāma slain, all those ‘knowing’ ones are proved
  false-speakers.”
'6': >-
  “These indeed are the lotus-marks upon the feet of noble women—women who,
  together with their husbands, are anointed by kings unto imperial
  sovereignty.”
'7': >-
  “By such ill-marks, women—rarely blessed by fortune—fall into widowhood. Yet I
  do not see those marks upon myself, though I look, for I am bereft of good
  fortune.”
'8': >-
  “The lotus-marks are truly said by the science of marks to belong to women;
  yet today, with Rāma slain, for me they become vain and untrue.”
'9': >-
  “My hair is fine, even, and dark; my eyebrows are unjoined; my legs are
  rounded and hairless; and my teeth are not set wide apart.”
'10': >-
  “My eyes are like conches; my hands and feet, my ankles and thighs are
  symmetrical and well-formed; my nails follow evenly; and my fingers are smooth
  and of equal length.”
'11': >-
  “My breasts are full, firm, and close-set, with nipples set in; my navel is
  deep and well-shaped; and my sides and chest are well-formed.”
'12': >-
  “My complexion is like a gem, and the hairs upon my limbs are soft.
  Mark-readers declared me to be endowed with auspicious signs, established in
  all the twelve (chief) auspicious marks.”
'13': >-
  “My hands and feet are well-filled, free from gaps, and possessed of good
  colour; and they deemed me, the maiden, to be one of gentle, smiling speech
  and bearing.”
'14': >-
  “That my anointing unto imperial sovereignty would be performed by Brāhmaṇas,
  together with my husband—so it was said by those skilled in discerning
  destiny; but all that has now been made false.”
'15': >-
  “Having searched Janasthāna and learned the tidings, having crossed the
  unshakable ocean—those two brothers have been slain as though in a cow’s
  footprint (so easily)!”
'16': >-
  “Did not the two Rāghavas obtain the Varuṇa-weapon, the Agni-weapon, the
  Indra-weapon, the Vāyu-weapon, and even the Brahmaśiras weapon?”
'17': >-
  “By one unseen in battle, through deceit, though they are like Vāsava (Indra)
  in might—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, my lords, have been slain, while I am left without
  refuge.”
'18': >-
  “For no foe, having come within the range of Rāghava’s sight in battle, would
  return alive—even if he had the speed of thought.”
'19': >-
  “There is no excess of burden upon Time; and Destiny is indeed most difficult
  to conquer—since in that place Rāma, with his brother, lies cast down upon the
  battlefield.”
'20': >-
  “I do not grieve so much for Rāma, nor for Lakṣmaṇa the great charioteer, nor
  even for myself or my mother, as I grieve for my ascetic mother-in-law.”
'21': >-
  “She ever thinks, having completed her vow and awaiting his return: ‘When
  shall I see Sītā, and Lakṣmaṇa, and Rāghava together?’”
'22': >-
  While she thus bewailed, the rākṣasī Trijaṭā spoke to her: “Do not fall into
  despair, O queen; your husband yet lives.”
'23': >-
  “And I shall tell you the great reasons, fitting and convincing, by which, O
  queen, these two brothers—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—are indeed alive.”
'24': >-
  “For in battle, the faces of warriors do not become thus overwhelmed by anger,
  and eager with joy, when their lord has been slain.”
'25': >-
  “This aerial car, O Vaidehī, is by name the Puṣpaka—divine. It would not be
  bearing you, if those two had departed this life.”
'26': >-
  “When the foremost heroes are slain, the army becomes bereft of zeal and
  without effort; it wanders confused in the conflicts, like a ship upon the
  waters whose rudder has been destroyed.”
'27': >-
  “But this army, O ascetic lady, is not bewildered, not distressed; it guards
  the two Kakutsthas—this I tell you with affection and assurance.”
'28': >-
  “Therefore be wholly confident, supported by these happy inferences. Behold
  the two Kakutsthas as unhurt; it is out of love that I speak thus to you.”
'29': >-
  “Never before have I spoken false, nor shall I speak it, O Maithilī. By your
  good conduct, gentle nature, and virtuous disposition, you have entered my
  heart.”
'30': >-
  “These two cannot be conquered in battle even by gods and asuras together with
  Indra; such is the certainty I have formed, and so I declare it to you.”
'31': >-
  “But this is a most wondrous sight, O Maithilī—see: though these two have
  fallen senseless, pierced with arrows, yet Lakṣmī (fortune and auspicious
  glory) does not abandon them.”
'32': >-
  “For generally, in men whose strength is gone and whose span of life is ended,
  when their faces are seen, a great distortion appears.”
'33': >-
  “Cast away grief and sorrow and delusion, O daughter of Janaka. For the sake
  of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, it is not possible that today they should be without
  life.”
'34': >-
  Hearing her words, Sītā, like unto a daughter of the gods, with folded hands,
  spoke to her: “So be it,” said the Maithilī.
'35': >-
  Then that Puṣpaka aerial car, swift as the mind, having been turned back,
  Sītā, downcast, was brought by Trijaṭā into Laṅkā itself.
'36': >-
  Thereafter, descending from the Puṣpaka together with Trijaṭā, she was led by
  the rākṣasīs into the Aśoka grove.
'37': >-
  Entering that tract thick with many trees—the pleasure-ground of the lord of
  rākṣasas—Sītā, beholding and reflecting upon the two royal princes, was
  overcome by the deepest despair.
'38': >-
  Thus ends the forty-eighth chapter in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the sacred
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Consolation of Sītā.”
