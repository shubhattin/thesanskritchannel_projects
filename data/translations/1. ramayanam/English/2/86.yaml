  Now begins the eighty-sixth canto of the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Guha’s Words.”
'1': >-
  Guha—whose ways were inscrutable, who moved in the deep forest—(spoke) to
  Bharata, who was himself immeasurable (in worth).
'2': >-
  Seeing him awake, endowed with noble qualities, bearing the excellent bow and
  quiver of arrows, I addressed Lakṣmaṇa, with intense purpose, for the guarding
  of the brother (Rāma).
'3': >-
  “This, dear one, is a comfortable bed prepared for your sake. Be reassured;
  lie down on it and rest in comfort, O delight of the Rāghavas.”
'4': >-
  “All these people are fit to endure hardship; you are fit for comfort. For the
  protection of that righteous-souled one, we shall remain awake, keeping
  watch.”
'5': >-
  “Indeed, on this earth there is none dearer to me than Rāma. Do not be
  anxious; I speak this—even if it may seem untrue—in your very presence.”
'6': >-
  “By his gracious favor, I hope to attain in this world great renown, abundant
  attainment of dharma, and also the gaining of wealth in full measure.”
'7': >-
  “Therefore I, with bow in hand, together with all my own kinsmen, shall
  protect my beloved friend Rāma as he lies down with Sītā.”
'8': >-
  “For nothing in this forest is unknown to me, as I ever move about here. Even
  a fourfold army we are able to withstand in battle.”
'9': >-
  Thus spoken to by great-souled Lakṣmaṇa, we all were placated—he being one who
  looked to dharma alone (as the guiding rule).
'10': >-
  “How could I obtain sleep—or even life, or any comforts—while the son of
  Daśaratha lies upon the ground with Sītā?”
'11': >-
  “He whom even all the devas and asuras together cannot overcome in
  battle—look, O Guha, at him, lying nestled among the grass with Sītā.”
'12': >-
  “Gained through great austerity and by many kinds of arduous efforts—this one
  son of Daśaratha bears marks befitting him (alone).”
'13': >-
  “When he has been sent into exile, the king will not live for long. The earth,
  I deem, will surely soon become widowed (bereft of its protector).”
'14': >-
  “The women, worn out by fatigue, having cried out with a great sound, have
  fallen silent; surely today the royal palace has become quiet, its uproar
  stilled.”
'15': >-
  “Kauśalyā, the king, and likewise my own mother—I do not expect that all of
  them will survive this night.”
'16': >-
  “My mother might yet live, sustained by caring for Śatrughna; but distressed
  Kauśalyā—she who gave birth to a hero—will perish.”
'17': >-
  “Gone, gone—without attaining the desire of his heart, without installing Rāma
  in the kingdom—my father will pass away.”
'18': >-
  “When that time arrives, those whose ends are accomplished (having obtained
  what they sought) will perform for the king all the rites due to the
  departed—his funeral observances and ceremonies.”
'19': >-
  “(Ayodhyā) with delightful crossroads and well-laid-out great highways;
  furnished with mansions and lofty palaces; adorned with every kind of jewel—
'20': >-
  “crowded with elephants, horses, and chariots; resonant with the sound of
  musical instruments; complete in every auspicious provision; thronged with
  joyful and well-nourished people—
'21': >-
  “abounding in pleasure-groves and gardens, rich in assemblies and festivals—my
  father’s capital will have its citizens moving about happily.”
'22': >-
  “And we too, along with him of true vows, if all is well—when this appointed
  time is completed—may we enter (that city) in happiness.”
'23': >-
  While that great-souled prince thus lamented, standing there, that night
  passed away.
'24': >-
  At dawn, when the sun had risen clear and bright, having had both of them
  arrange their matted locks, I ferried them across in comfort at this bank of
  the Bhāgīrathī (Gaṅgā).
'25': >-
  Those two, wearing matted hair and bark garments, mighty in strength like
  leaders of elephant herds, bearing excellent arrows, bow, and sword—supremely
  austere—looked about and went on their way together with Sītā.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-sixth canto in the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the primeval epic.
'27': >-
  Thus concludes, in the venerable, glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki—the
  Ādikāvya—the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa’s eighty-sixth canto, called “Guha’s Words.”
