  Now begins, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, the seventieth
  canto, called “The Choosing of the Maidens (Brides)”.
'1': >-
  Then, at daybreak, King Janaka—having performed the appointed rites along with
  the great sages—spoke these words; he, skilled in speech, addressed Śatānanda,
  his family priest.
'2': >-
  “I have a brother of great splendour, mighty in valour and exceedingly
  righteous in conduct, renowned by the name Kuśadhvaja, who dwells in a
  beautiful city.”
'3': >-
  “He lives at Sāṅkāśyā—holy and resplendent—like the aerial car Puṣpaka; and
  there flows the river Ikṣumatī, from whose waters, as far as its banks and
  fruits abound, one may drink.”
'4': >-
  “I desire to see him. He is regarded by me as the protector of this sacrifice;
  and that great-souled, mighty one will also partake of this rejoicing together
  with me.”
'5': >-
  When these words were spoken in the presence of Śatānanda, certain men arrived
  without delay, and Janaka issued them his command.
'6': >-
  By order of the lord of men, they set out with swift horses, to bring that
  tiger among men—like Viṣṇu going forth at Indra’s command.
'7': >-
  Reaching Sāṅkāśyā, they beheld Kuśadhvaja and reported to him in full what had
  occurred, and what Janaka had in mind.
'8': >-
  Hearing that account from those best of messengers, swift and forceful,
  Kuśadhvaja, by the command of the king of men, came at once.
'9': >-
  He saw the great-souled Janaka, devoted to dharma; and after paying reverence
  to Śatānanda and to Janaka, most righteous of kings,
'10': >-
  he ascended a supreme, splendid seat worthy of a monarch. Thus the two
  brothers of immeasurable splendour sat together.
'11': >-
  Then those two heroic brothers sent forth their foremost minister, Sudāman:
  “Go, O lord of ministers, quickly to the Ikṣvāku of immeasurable radiance.”
'12': >-
  “Bring him here, along with his sons—invincible—and with his counsellors as
  well. Go to the place of assembly and bring the increaser of the Raghu line.”
'13': >-
  Having gone there, Sudāman saw that lord and, bowing with his head in
  reverence, spoke thus: “O ruler of Ayodhyā, O hero, the Videha—Janaka, lord of
  Mithilā—”
'14': >-
  “has resolved to see you, together with your preceptor and family priest.”
  Hearing the words of the foremost minister, the king, along with the company
  of sages likewise,
'15': >-
  went with his kinsmen to the place where Janaka was. The king went with his
  ministers, with his preceptor, and with his relatives.
'16': >-
  Then the best among those skilled in speech spoke these words to the Videha:
  “It is known to you, O great king, the divine lineage of the Ikṣvāku house.”
'17': >-
  “In all affairs, the blessed sage Vasiṣṭha is the spokesman, permitted by
  Viśvāmitra and along with all the great seers.”
'18': >-
  “This righteous Vasiṣṭha will relate it to you in due order.” When Daśaratha
  had fallen silent, the blessed sage Vasiṣṭha
'19': >-
  spoke, he who knew speech well, to the Videha together with his priests:
  “Brahmā—whose origin is unmanifest, eternal, everlasting, and undecaying—”
'20': >-
  “from him was born Marīci; from Marīci, Kaśyapa as his son; from Kaśyapa was
  born Vivasvān; and Manu, known as Vaivasvata, was born of Vivasvān.”
'21': >-
  “Manu, the Prajāpati of old, had a son Ikṣvāku. Know Ikṣvāku as the former
  king established in Ayodhyā.”
'22': >-
  “To Ikṣvāku was born the illustrious son famed as Kukṣi; and from Kukṣi, the
  illustrious Vikukṣi was born as his son.”
'23': >-
  “From Vikukṣi was born the great-lustred and mighty son Bāṇa; and from Bāṇa
  was born the great-lustred and valiant Anaraṇya.”
'24': >-
  “From Anaraṇya was born Pṛthu; and from Pṛthu, Triśaṅku. To Triśaṅku was born
  the highly renowned Dhundhumāra.”
'25': >-
  “From Dhundhumāra was born the great-lustred Yuvanāśva, a mighty
  chariot-warrior; and the son of Yuvanāśva was Māndhātā, lord of the earth.”
'26': >-
  “To Māndhātā was born the illustrious Susandhi; and Susandhi had two sons:
  Dhruvasandhi and Prasenajit.”
'27': >-
  “To the famed Dhruvasandhi was born a son in name called Bharata; and from
  Bharata was born the great-lustred one named Asita.”
'28': >-
  “Against him arose rival kings as enemies—Haihayas and Tāla-jaṅghas, and the
  Śūras, and the Śaśabindus.”
'29': >-
  “Waging war against them, that king was driven forth in battle; and then,
  going to the Himālaya, he stayed there together with his two wives.”
'30': >-
  “King Asita, of diminished forces, reached the law of Time—passed away. And it
  is heard that his two wives were then with child.”
'31': >-
  “One wife, intending the destruction of the embryo, gave her co-wife a potion
  named ‘sagara’. Thereupon, on a lovely mountain-slope, a sage dwelt,
  delighting in that place—”
'32': >-
  “the Bhārgava named Cyavana, who had taken refuge in the Himālaya. There, one
  highly fortunate lady, a princess,
'33': >-
  lotus-eyed, desiring an excellent son, bowed to the Bhārgava sage whose
  splendour was like that of the gods; approaching that ṛṣi, she reverently
  saluted him.”
'34': >-
  That brāhmaṇa sage spoke to her, who longed for a son, concerning the birth of
  a son: “In your womb, O highly blessed one, an excellent son of very great
  strength”
'35': >-
  “endowed with mighty heroism and great splendour will soon be born—together
  with the ‘gara’ (poisonous mixture). Do not grieve, O lotus-eyed lady.”
'36': >-
  Having saluted Cyavana, that king’s daughter, faithful to her husband, gave
  birth to a son—though separated from her husband.
'37': >-
  But because a ‘gara’ had been given to her by the co-wife with the intent to
  kill the embryo, the child who was born came forth together with that very
  ‘gara’; thus he became known as Sagara.
'38': >-
  To Sagara was born Asamañjas; and from Asamañjas, Aṃśumān. Dilīpa was the son
  of Aṃśumān; and to Dilīpa was born Bhāgīratha.
'39': >-
  From Bhāgīratha was born Kakutstha; and from Kakutstha, Raghu. To Raghu was
  born the radiant Pravṛddha, also called Puruṣādaka.
'40': >-
  And there was also Kalmāṣapāda; from him was born Śaṅkhaṇa; from Śaṅkhaṇa,
  Sudarśana; and from Sudarśana, Agnivarṇa.
'41': >-
  To Agnivarṇa was born Śīghraga; Śīghraga’s son was Maru. From Maru was born
  Praśuśruka; from Praśuśruka, Ambarīṣa.
'42': >-
  To Ambarīṣa was born the king Nahūṣa; to Nahūṣa, Yayāti; and Nabhāga was born
  as the son of Yayāti.
'43': >-
  To Nabhāga was born Aja; and from Aja was born Daśaratha. From that Daśaratha
  were born the two brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.
'44': >-
  “They are of a primeval and purified dynasty—kings supremely righteous—born in
  the Ikṣvāku line: heroes, speakers of truth.”
'45': >-
  “For the sake of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, I seek your daughters’ hands in marriage,
  O king. O best of men, it is fitting that you give (your daughters) to those
  two who are their equals in worth.”
'46': >-
  Thus ends the seventieth canto, called “The Choosing of the Maidens (Brides)”,
  in the Bāla-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
