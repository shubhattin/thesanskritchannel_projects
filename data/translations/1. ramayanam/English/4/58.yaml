  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the
  fifty-eighth canto, named “The Discovery of Tidings of Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed with those piteous words by the monkeys who had as good as
  abandoned their lives, the vulture—his voice deep and mighty—replied to the
  vānara hosts, his eyes filled with tears.
'2': >-
  “You speak of my younger brother—Jatāyu by name, O monkeys—whom you have
  reported as having been slain in battle by the powerful Rāvaṇa.”
'3': >-
  “Because of my age and because my wings are gone, I must endure even that
  grievous hearing; for today there is no strength in me to exact vengeance for
  my brother’s enmity.”
'4': >-
  “Long ago, when the slaying of Vṛtra had taken place, he and I, both eager for
  victory, went up to the Sun himself—blazing, encircled with garlands of rays.”
'5': >-
  “Covering the path of the sky, we soared with great speed, and indeed went up
  toward heaven; but when we reached the middle region near the Sun, Jatāyu
  began to fail.”
'6': >-
  “Seeing my brother scorched by the Sun’s rays, I, out of affection and in
  utmost agitation, covered him with my two wings.”
'7': >-
  “Then I—my feathers burnt, fallen upon the Vindhya, O bull-like leaders of
  monkeys—have dwelt here, and I have had no knowledge of my brother’s doings.”
'8': >-
  When he had spoken thus—Sampāti, the brother of Jatāyu—Aṅgada, the crown
  prince, great in wisdom, replied to him then.
'9': >-
  “If you are Jatāyu’s brother—what you have said, I have heard. Tell us, if you
  know, the abode of that rākṣasa.”
'10': >-
  “That short-sighted Rāvaṇa, the vilest among rākṣasas—whether he be near or
  far—if you know, declare it to us.”
'11': >-
  Then the mighty one, the elder brother of Jatāyu, spoke words befitting
  himself, gladdening the monkey warriors.
'12': >-
  “My wings are burnt; I am a vulture, my vigor is spent, O plavaṅgamas. Yet by
  speech alone I shall render Rāma the highest aid.”
'13': >-
  “I know the worlds of Varuṇa, and also the three-striding courses of Viṣṇu; I
  know the collisions of devas and asuras, and the churning that brought forth
  nectar.”
'14': >-
  “But for this task of Rāma—what must first be done by me—my splendor has been
  taken away by old age, and my life-breaths are slackened.”
'15': >-
  “A young woman, endowed with beauty, adorned with every ornament, I saw being
  carried off by that evil-souled Rāvaṇa.”
'16': >-
  “Crying aloud, ‘Rāma, Rāma!’ and ‘Lakṣmaṇa!’—that lovely lady—casting away her
  ornaments and shaking her limbs in anguish.”
'17': >-
  “Like the radiance of the sun upon a mountain peak, her superb silken garment
  shone upon that dark rākṣasa, as lightning shines upon a cloud.”
'18': >-
  “And that woman I deem to be Sītā, from her constant uttering of Rāma’s name.
  Hear from me as I tell the dwelling-place of that rākṣasa.”
'19': >-
  “A rākṣasa named Rāvaṇa—the direct son of Viśravas, and the brother of
  Vaiśravaṇa (Kubera)—dwells in the city called Laṅkā.”
'20': >-
  “Here, across the sea, lies an island extending a full hundred yojanas; on
  that island stands the lovely city of Laṅkā, built by Viśvakarman.”
'21': >-
  “It is well fashioned with wondrous gates made of Jāmbūnada gold, with golden
  platforms and terraces, and with vast mansions of the hue of gold.”
'22': >-
  “Endowed with a great rampart, bright as the sun, in that city dwells
  Vaidehī—despondent—clad in silken raiment.”
'23': >-
  “Confined within Rāvaṇa’s inner apartments, guarded well by rākṣasīs, there
  you shall behold Maithilī, the daughter of King Janaka.”
'24': >-
  “Laṅkā is hidden and protected, being encircled on every side by the ocean.
  Having reached the far shore of the sea—an expanse of a full hundred yojanas—”
'25': >-
  “—and coming to the southern coast, then you shall see Rāvaṇa. There itself,
  hasten quickly and exert your prowess, O plavaṅgamas.”
'26': >-
  “By knowledge indeed I perceive that, once you have seen, you will return. The
  first course is that of small birds—kulīṅgas and others that live upon grain.”
'27': >-
  “The second is for those that feed on offerings and for those that eat the
  fruits of trees; the bhāsas (a kind of raptor) go by the third; and the
  krauñcas go, together with the kuraras, by another.”
'28': >-
  “Hawks take the fourth path; vultures take the fifth—those endowed with
  strength and valor, possessing comeliness and youthful vigor.”
'29': >-
  “But the sixth path is for the swans; the supreme course is that of Vainateya
  (Garuḍa). And from Vainateya is our birth, O bull-like leaders of monkeys.”
'30': >-
  “Yet a blameworthy deed was done—namely, that we fed on flesh; and for that,
  the enmity incurred through my brother’s fate should be requited by me.”
'31': >-
  “Remaining here, I can behold Rāvaṇa, and also Jānakī. Ours too is the vision
  of Suparṇa’s line—divine sight and strength of sight.”
'32': >-
  “Therefore, by the power born of food and by inherent nature, O monkeys, we
  can ever see from a distance of a hundred yojanas and more.”
'33': >-
  “Our manner of life is ordained by nature to be from afar; but the life of
  those who fight on foot is appointed to be at the roots of trees.”
'34': >-
  “Let some means be devised for crossing the salt waters; having approached
  Vaidehī, you shall return with your purpose fulfilled.”
'35': >-
  “I wish to be led by you to the ocean, the abode of Varuṇa. I shall offer
  water for my brother, that great-souled one who has gone to heaven.”
'36': >-
  Then the exceedingly powerful monkeys led the wingless Sampāti to that place,
  upon the shore of the lord of rivers and streams (the ocean).
'37': >-
  And having brought the lord of birds back again to that place, the monkeys
  became joyful, for they had obtained the tidings they sought.
'38': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-eighth canto, named “The Discovery of Tidings of Sītā,” in
  the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
