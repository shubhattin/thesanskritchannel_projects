  Now begins the fifty-sixth canto of Bālakāṇḍa in the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Might of Brahmanical Splendour.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by Vasiṣṭha, the mighty Viśvāmitra, fixing his mind upon the
  Agneya weapon, cried out, “Stand! Stand!”
'2': >-
  Thereupon the revered Vasiṣṭha, lifting up the Brahma-staff—like another staff
  of Death (Kāla) itself—spoke these words in wrath:
'3': >-
  “O disgrace to the kṣatriyas, here I stand. Display the strength that is in
  thee. Today, O son of Gādhi, I shall destroy the pride of thy weapon!”
'4': >-
  “Where is thy kṣatriya strength, and where is the great strength of Brahman?
  Behold my divine Brahmanic might, O lowest of kṣatriyas!”
'5': >-
  The dreadful and excellent Agneya weapon of the son of Gādhi was pacified by
  the Brahma-staff, even as the fiery rush of Agni is quenched by water.
'6': >-
  Then, enraged, the descendant of Gādhi hurled the Vāruṇa, the Raudra, the
  Aindra, and likewise the Pāśupata, and also the Aiṣīka weapon.
'7': >-
  He also cast the Mānava, the Mohana, the Gāndharva, and the Svāpana; the
  Jṛmbhaṇa, the Mādana; and the weapons of torment and lamentation.
'8': >-
  He hurled the Śoṣaṇa and the Dāraṇa, and the Vajra-weapon, most difficult to
  overcome; the Brahma-pāśa and the Kāla-pāśa; and the Vāruṇa noose as well.
'9': >-
  He cast the Pināka weapon, so dear (to Śiva); the Thunderbolt in dry and wet
  forms; then the Daṇḍa weapon; the Paiśāca; and likewise the Kraunca weapon.
'10': >-
  He hurled the Dharma-cakra, the Kāla-cakra, and also the Viṣṇu-cakra; the
  Vāyavya; the Mathana weapon; and that named Hayaśiras.
'11': >-
  He cast the pair of Śaktis, and the Kaṅkāla and the Musala; the great
  Vidyādhara weapon; and then the terrible Kāla weapon.
'12': >-
  He hurled the dreadful Trident weapon, and the Kāpāla, and the Kaṅkaṇa. All
  these weapons, O delight of the Raghus, he discharged.
'13': >-
  But before Vasiṣṭha, best among those absorbed in japa, it became as though a
  marvel: all of them the son of Brahmā swallowed up with his staff.
'14': >-
  When those had been quelled, the descendant of Gādhi hurled the Brahmā weapon.
  Seeing that weapon raised and launched, the gods—with Agni at their head—(were
  struck with awe).
'15': >-
  The divine seers, and the Gandharvas together with the great serpents, were
  bewildered; the three worlds became terrified when the Brahmā weapon was set
  in motion.
'16': >-
  Yet that exceedingly dreadful Brahmā weapon too Vasiṣṭha swallowed up entirely
  with Brahmanic splendour by means of Brahmanic power, using the Brahma-staff,
  O Rāghava.
'17': >-
  As that great-souled Vasiṣṭha was swallowing up the Brahmā weapon, his form
  became fierce and terrible, bewildering to the three worlds.
'18': >-
  From all the pores of that great-souled Vasiṣṭha there sprang forth rays, as
  it were—flame-tongues of fire, thick with smoke.
'19': >-
  And the Brahma-staff in Vasiṣṭha’s uplifted hand blazed forth, like the
  smokeless fire of Time at dissolution—like yet another rod of Yama.
'20': >-
  Then the hosts of sages praised Vasiṣṭha, the foremost of those who practise
  japa: “Unfailing is thy Brahmanic power; O Brahman, sustain thy splendour with
  splendour!”
'21': >-
  “By thee, O Brahman, Viśvāmitra of great might has been restrained. Unfailing
  is thy excellent power. Let the worlds be free from distress.”
'22': >-
  Thus addressed, that great-souled, mighty one calmed himself.
  Viśvāmitra—humbled and overborne—heaved a sigh and spoke these words:
'23': >-
  “Shame upon kṣatriya strength! True strength is the strength of Brahmanic
  splendour. By a single Brahma-staff all my weapons have been destroyed.”
'24': >-
  “Seeing this, with senses and mind now made serene, I shall undertake great
  austerity—verily that which is the cause of attaining Brahmanhood.”
'25': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-sixth canto of Bālakāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the
  Ādikāvya, entitled “The Might of Brahmanical Splendour.”
