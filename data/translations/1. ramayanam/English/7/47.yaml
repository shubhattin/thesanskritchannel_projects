  Then, in the holy and glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins
  the forty-seventh sarga, named “The narration of Rāma’s command.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon Rāghava’s younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) mounted a broad and well-spread
  boat of the Niṣāda boatmen, well-equipped; first he caused Maithilī (Sītā) to
  embark, and then he ascended.
'2': >-
  Afflicted with sorrow, Lakṣmaṇa said to Sumantra, the charioteer, “Remain
  here,” and he said to the boatman as well, “Proceed.”
'3': >-
  Then, coming to the bank of the Bhāgīrathī, Lakṣmaṇa addressed Maithilī with
  folded hands, his eyes flooded with tears.
'4': >-
  “A great and piercing anguish has entered my heart, because, O Vaidehī, by the
  noble and wise (Rāma), on account of this very matter, he has been made an
  object of people’s talk.”
'5': >-
  “For me today, death would be better—either death itself, or whatever lies
  beyond death; and in such a deed as this, censured by the world, I ought not
  to be employed.”
'6': >-
  “Be gracious, O beautiful one, and you should not make me commit sin.” Thus,
  with joined palms, Lakṣmaṇa fell down upon the ground.
'7': >-
  Seeing Lakṣmaṇa weeping with folded hands, desiring death for himself,
  Maithilī, exceedingly shaken, spoke these words to him.
'8': >-
  “What is this? I do not understand it. Tell me the truth, Lakṣmaṇa. I see that
  you are not at ease—nor do I see the welfare of the king (Rāma).”
'9': >-
  “Have you been cursed by the lord of men, that you have fallen into such
  distress? Tell it to me in my presence; I command you.”
'10': >-
  Urged by Vaidehī, Lakṣmaṇa, his mind dejected, with face cast downward and
  choked with tears, spoke these words indeed.
'11': >-
  “Hearing in the midst of the assembly a most dreadful slander—both in the city
  and in the countryside—on your account, O daughter of Janaka, Rāma, with a
  heart tormented, went home without even informing you.”
'12': >-
  “Those words are not fit to be spoken by me before you, O देवी—those which, in
  anger, were placed in the king’s heart and uttered behind your back.”
'13': >-
  “You—though blameless—have been abandoned by the king in my very presence,
  through fear of the citizens’ reproach. This, O lady, must be accepted by you;
  there is no other course.”
'14': >-
  “At the ends of the hermitages you are to be left by me. Knowing the king’s
  command, this indeed is the cruelty (hard-heartedness) shown toward you.”
'15': >-
  “This, on the bank of the Jāhnavī, is the sacred grove of austerity of the
  Brahmarṣis—holy and delightful. Do not give way to grief, O auspicious one.”
'16': >-
  “The foremost of sages, the beloved of King Daśaratha—my father—and a supreme
  brāhmaṇa, Vālmīki, of very great fame, is his intimate friend.”
'17': >-
  “Approaching the shade of that great-souled one’s feet, dwell in comfort
  there, O daughter of Janaka—intent solely on fasting and self-restraint.”
'18': >-
  “Upholding the state of a devoted wife, keeping Rāma ever in your heart, the
  highest good shall come to you, O lady, if you act thus.”
'19': >-
  Thus ends the forty-seventh sarga, named “The narration of Rāma’s command,” in
  the Uttarakāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
