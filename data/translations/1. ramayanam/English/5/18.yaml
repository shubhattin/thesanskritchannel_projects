'0': >-
  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa,
  begins the Eighteenth Sarga, entitled “The Coming (Arrival) of Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  While he thus kept gazing upon the forest with its trees in bloom, and while
  he searched for Vaidehī (Sītā), a little portion of the night still remained.
'2': >-
  In the middle of the night, he heard the Brahma-hymns (Vedic chants) of the
  Brahma-rākṣasas—those who were versed in the six auxiliaries of the Veda and
  who performed the most excellent sacrifices.
'3': >-
  Then, with auspicious musical instruments whose sounds were pleasing to the
  ear and the mind, the mighty-armed, mighty in strength, ten-necked Rāvaṇa was
  awakened.
'4': >-
  Having awoken, that highly fortunate and valorous lord of the rākṣasas—wearing
  garlands and garments that had become loosened—turned his thought toward
  Vaidehī (Sītā).
'5': >-
  Powerfully impelled toward her by Kāma (the god of love), and swollen with
  intoxication, the rākṣasa could not conceal within himself that desire.
'6': >-
  Adorned with every ornament, bearing unsurpassed splendour, he proceeded into
  that grove, frequented by many kinds of trees, all endowed with blossoms and
  fruits.
'7': >-
  It was encompassed by lotus-ponds beautified with many sorts of flowers, and
  ever made wondrous and variegated by birds, exhilarated and intoxicated with
  delight.
'8': >-
  It was also surrounded by diverse deer—fair to behold and pleasing to the eye
  and mind; and as he went, he looked upon the avenues with gateways of jewels
  and gold.
'9': >-
  Filled with herds of many kinds of deer, and strewn about with fallen fruits,
  he entered that very Aśoka grove, thickly covered with trees.
'10': >-
  A hundred women followed him as he went—Poulastya (Rāvaṇa), as celestial women
  of gods and gandharvas follow Mahendra (Indra).
'11': >-
  Some women there took up golden lamps; others held chowries of yak-tail in
  their hands, and still others bore fans of palm-leaves.
'12': >-
  And with golden ewers they carried water before him; while others took
  round-topped seats (or cushions) and woven mats, and went behind him.
'13': >-
  One woman, radiant, took in her right hand a jewel-made vessel filled with
  drink.
'14': >-
  Another, taking a parasol resembling a royal swan and shining like the full
  moon, with a golden staff, went behind him.
'15': >-
  Rāvaṇa’s foremost women, their eyes overcome by sleep and intoxication,
  followed their heroic lord like dense lightning-creepers trailing a cloud.
'16': >-
  Their necklaces and armlets were disordered; their complexions were smudged
  and rubbed; the ends of their hair were loosened and fallen; and their faces
  were wet with sweat.
'17': >-
  Whirling about from the remnants of intoxication and from drowsiness, those
  fair-faced women had their body-flowers (garlands) wilted by sweat, and their
  hair entangled with garlands.
'18': >-
  As he went, the lord of the rākṣasas was followed by women with eyes made
  languid by wine—his dear wives—out of honour and also out of desire.
'19': >-
  And that mighty husband of theirs, enthralled by sensual pleasure, with his
  mind attached to Sītā, appeared dull and slow, his gait languid and unsteady.
'20': >-
  Then Hanumān, the monkey—son of Māruta (the Wind-god)—heard the jingling sound
  of girdles and the ringing of anklets of those eminent women.
'21': >-
  And the monkey Hanumān saw him—the performer of incomparable deeds, of
  unthinkable strength and prowess—having come to the region of the doorway.
'22': >-
  He was illumined on all sides by many lamps, carried before him, anointed with
  fragrant oils.
'23': >-
  Possessed of desire, pride, and intoxication, with eyes red and slightly
  askew, he seemed like Kāma himself standing manifest, after casting away his
  bow and arrows.
'24': >-
  He was drawing along an excellent garment, white as the foam of churned
  nectar, free from dust, loosened and slipping, caught upon his limb, and
  trailing with flowers.
'25': >-
  Hidden in a branch-cluster, covered by hundreds of leaves and blossoms,
  Hanumān, as Rāvaṇa approached nearby, began to observe him so as to know him
  clearly.
'26': >-
  Then, as he looked, that great monkey beheld Rāvaṇa’s excellent women—endowed
  with beauty and youth.
'27': >-
  Surrounded by those comely women, the illustrious king entered that
  pleasure-grove resounding with the cries of deer and flocks of birds.
'28': >-
  Intoxicated, wearing many kinds of ornaments, having ears like sharp points
  (Śaṅku-karṇa), of great strength—thus was seen that lord of the rākṣasas, the
  son of Viśravas.
'29': >-
  Encircled by supreme women like the moon by stars, that great monkey, radiant
  with splendour, beheld him—himself possessed of mighty splendour.
'30': >-
  Thinking, “This is Rāvaṇa, the mighty-armed,” the vānarā (Hanumān) reflected:
  “He indeed is the very one who formerly lay in the midst of the city in that
  excellent mansion.” And the great-souled Hanumān, son of Māruta, leapt away.
'31': >-
  Yet even so, though fierce in radiance, he was overpowered and shaken by that
  one’s splendour; and the intelligent Hanumān, clinging within a concealed gap
  among the leaves, remained well-hidden.
'32': >-
  Rāvaṇa then turned back, desiring to see that woman with dark hair-ends, fair
  hips, full and close-set breasts, and dark eyes—(Sītā) with black pupils and
  dark lashes.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the Eighteenth Sarga of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the venerable, holy
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Coming (Arrival) of
  Rāvaṇa.”
