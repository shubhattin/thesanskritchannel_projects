  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  thirty-fifth canto, entitled “The Reproach of Sumantra.”
'1': >-
  Then, suddenly shaking himself, and again and again heaving a sigh, he pressed
  one palm into the other and ground his teeth together.
'2': >-
  His eyes, reddened with wrath, abandoned their former natural hue; overpowered
  at once by anger, he fell into a grievous and inauspicious heat of distress.
'3': >-
  And the charioteer, Sumantra, gazing within his own mind, as though causing
  Kaikeyī’s heart to tremble, assailed her with sharp arrows of speech.
'4': >-
  With thunderbolt-like, unparalleled, and baleful words—piercing, as it were,
  all Kaikeyī’s vital points—Sumantra addressed her in reply.
'5': >-
  “That king Daśaratha—your husband—has been cast aside by you, though he is
  himself the lord and husband of the whole world, of all that is moving and
  unmoving.”
'6': >-
  “For you, O Queen, there is truly nothing more wrongful than this. I deem you
  a slayer of your husband, and in the end even a destroyer of the dynasty.”
'7': >-
  “By your deeds you torment one who is like Indra, unconquerable; like a
  mountain, hard to shake; like the great ocean, unagitated and unperturbable.”
'8': >-
  “Do not despise Daśaratha—your husband, the giver of boons, your lord. For, in
  truth, to women the will of the husband is held to surpass even crores of
  sons.”
'9': >-
  “In due course of age, kingdoms pass on when kings come to their end; yet,
  while the lord of the Ikṣvāku line still lives, you desire to blot him out.”
'10': >-
  “Let your son Bharata become king and rule the earth; but we shall go
  there—wherever Rāma shall go.”
'11': >-
  “And in your realm no Brāhmaṇa will be fit to dwell; today you would commit a
  deed so lawless, so beyond all bounds of propriety.”
'12': >-
  “Surely we shall all take to the very path trodden by Rāma—abandoned by all
  kinsmen, and ever forsaken by Brāhmaṇas and holy men.”
'13': >-
  “What joy, O Queen, will arise to you from gaining a kingdom, if you intend to
  do a deed so lawless and out of measure?”
'14': >-
  “It is as though I behold a marvel—that such should be your conduct. When you
  behave thus, the earth is, as it were, laid bare at once.”
'15': >-
  “Even the blazing ‘rod of speech,’ created by the great Brahma-rishis—fearful
  to behold—does not strike you down, though you stand fixed upon sending Rāma
  into exile.”
'16': >-
  “Who, after cutting down a mango tree with an axe, would then tend a neem? And
  even if one were to water it with milk, it would never become sweet.”
'17': >-
  “Such indeed, I think, is your noble birth, as is your mother’s. For from a
  neem, honey does not flow—so runs the saying in this world.”
'18': >-
  “We have formerly known of your mother’s grasping at what is unworthy, as we
  have heard. Some boon-giver granted your father an unsurpassed boon.”
'19': >-
  “From that boon, the lord of the land came to understand the cries of all
  beings; by it, the speech even of creatures that go as animals became known to
  him.”
'20': >-
  “Then, once, while he lay asleep, he heard the cry of a jṛmbha-bird, radiant
  and loud; and knowing its intent, your father there laughed many times.”
'21': >-
  “Thereupon your mother, angered and desiring to cast a noose of death upon
  him, said to the king: ‘O gentle one, I wish to know the reason for your
  laughter.’”
'22': >-
  “And the king said to that queen: ‘If I tell you the cause of my laughter,
  then my death will come at once—of this there is no doubt.’”
'23': >-
  “But your mother, O Queen, again spoke to your father, the king of Kekaya:
  ‘Tell me—live or die; you shall not laugh at me.’”
'24': >-
  “Thus addressed by his beloved, the lord of the earth, the king of Kekaya,
  explained to her in truth the matter concerning that boon-giver.”
'25': >-
  “Then that boon-giver, a righteous man, spoke to the king: ‘Let us die; let us
  perish—do not tell it, O lord of men.’”
'26': >-
  “Hearing those words of his, the king, with mind made glad, at once rejected
  your mother and sported like Kubera, the lord of riches.”
'27': >-
  “So you too, deluded, follow this unworthy grasping upon the path of wicked
  conduct, O you of sinful outlook, with regard to the king.”
'28': >-
  “And here a worldly proverb seems true to me: men take after their fathers;
  women, their mothers.”
'29': >-
  “Do not be so. Accept this which the lord of the earth has declared: here
  attend upon your husband’s will; become the refuge and right course for this
  people.”
'30': >-
  “Do not, urged on by sinners, bring upon your husband—who shines like the king
  of the gods, who is the upholder of the worlds—an unrighteous course.”
'31': >-
  “For the blameless, illustrious King Daśaratha, O Queen, lotus-eyed, will not
  do what he has promised falsely.”
'32': >-
  “Let mighty Rāma be consecrated—he who is the eldest, generous, capable in
  action; the protector of his own dharma, and the protector of the living
  world.”
'33': >-
  “A great reproach will indeed spread of you in the world, O Queen, if Rāma
  goes to the forest, abandoning his father, the king.”
'34': >-
  “Let Rāghava protect his own kingdom; be you free from fevered agitation. For
  none other than Rāghava is fit, dwelling in this best of cities.”
'35': >-
  “For when Rāma is established in the position of heir-apparent, King
  Daśaratha, the great archer, will enter the forest, remembering what was done
  before.”
'36': >-
  “Thus—by gentle conciliation and by harsh words—Sumantra, with hands joined in
  reverence, again and again agitated Kaikeyī in the royal assembly.”
'37': >-
  “But that queen was not shaken at all, nor did she fall into dejection; nor
  then could any change be discerned in the hue of her face.”
'38': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fifth canto in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Reproach of Sumantra.”
