  Now begins the one-hundred-and-first Sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the glorious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Casting of the Spear upon Lakṣmaṇa.”
'1': >-
  When that missile had been repelled, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, doubled his
  wrath; and from that very anger he at once set in motion another weapon.
'2': >-
  The mighty and splendid Rāvaṇa then began to hurl, against Rāghava, another
  dreadful, terrific missile—one fashioned by Māya.
'3': >-
  Thereupon blazing tridents, maces, and heavy clubs shot forth from his bow on
  every side—adamantine-hard, like thunderbolts.
'4': >-
  Iron mallets, noose-snare weapons, and likewise flaming thunderbolts—various,
  keen-edged—leapt out, like fierce winds at the dissolution of an age.
'5': >-
  That missile the illustrious Rāghava—best among the knowers of the supreme
  weapons, and of great splendour—struck down with the mighty Gāndharva weapon.
'6': >-
  When that weapon had been repelled by the great-souled Rāghava, Rāvaṇa, his
  eyes copper-red with rage, unleashed the Saurā (Solar) missile.
'7': >-
  Then from the bow of the wise, ten-necked one—terrible in speed—great,
  resplendent discus-wheels flew forth.
'8': >-
  With them rushing in from all directions the sky blazed; and the quarters,
  too, were lit up by those descending discs, as though by the moon, the sun,
  and the planets.
'9': >-
  Those discus-wheels, and the wondrous weapons of Rāvaṇa set at the forefront
  of his host, Rāghava cut down with a torrent of arrows.
'10': >-
  Seeing that missile destroyed, Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, pierced Rāma with
  ten arrows in all his vital spots.
'11': >-
  Though struck by those ten arrows shot from the great bow by Rāvaṇa, the
  mighty and radiant Rāghava did not so much as tremble.
'12': >-
  Then the battle-subduer Rāghava, thoroughly enraged, pierced Rāvaṇa in all his
  limbs with many shafts.
'13': >-
  Meanwhile, the mighty younger brother of Rāghava—Lakṣmaṇa, slayer of
  heroes—seized seven arrows in wrath.
'14': >-
  With those swift-flying shafts the splendid Lakṣmaṇa cut Rāvaṇa’s man-headed
  banner into many pieces.
'15': >-
  And with a single arrow the illustrious Lakṣmaṇa of great strength struck off
  the charioteer’s head, adorned with flaming earrings.
'16': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, with five sharp arrows, also cut the bow of the rākṣasa
  lord—huge as an elephant’s trunk—into pieces.
'17': >-
  And Vibhīṣaṇa, leaping up, struck down with a mace the enemy Rāvaṇa’s
  horses—dark as blue clouds and mountain-like in stature.
'18': >-
  When his horses were slain, Rāvaṇa quickly sprang down from the great chariot,
  and conceived intense anger against his brother.
'19': >-
  Then the mighty-armed and valiant lord of rākṣasas hurled at Vibhīṣaṇa a
  blazing spear—like a flaming thunderbolt.
'20': >-
  Before it could reach him, Lakṣmaṇa cut that spear in three with three arrows;
  and then there arose a great roar among the vānaras in that mighty battle.
'21': >-
  That spear, wreathed in gold garlands, fell in three pieces—spark-scattering
  and aflame—like a great meteor fallen from heaven.
'22': >-
  Thereupon he took up a vast spear, more formidable still—hard to assail even
  by Time—shining with its own radiance.
'23': >-
  Hurled with force by the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, that exceedingly radiant spear
  blazed, its splendour like a flaming thunderbolt.
'24': >-
  At that moment the hero Lakṣmaṇa swiftly sprang toward that Vibhīṣaṇa, who had
  fallen into peril of life.
'25': >-
  To deliver him, the valiant Lakṣmaṇa, bending his bow, showered Rāvaṇa—holding
  the spear in his hand—with a rain of arrows.
'26': >-
  Being overwhelmed by that mass of arrows discharged by the great-souled one,
  his prowess turned aside, Rāvaṇa could not bring his mind to strike.
'27': >-
  Seeing his brother released, that Rāvaṇa faced Lakṣmaṇa and, standing firm,
  spoke these words:
'28': >-
  “O boaster of strength, because of you Vibhīṣaṇa has thus been set free; and
  the spear, aimed at the rākṣasa, is brought down by you.”
'29': >-
  “This spear, marked with blood-red signs, cast forth by the iron-bar of my
  arms, shall split your heart and, taking your life-breath, depart.”
'30': >-
  So saying, he took up that spear with eight bells, of mighty sound—wrought by
  Māya through magic, unfailing, and a slayer of foes—
'31': >-
  and, directing it at Lakṣmaṇa, blazing as if with its own fire, the utterly
  enraged Rāvaṇa hurled it, roaring aloud.
'32': >-
  Cast with dreadful speed, and thundering like a thunderbolt, that spear rushed
  swiftly upon Lakṣmaṇa at the head of the battle.
'33': >-
  As that spear came hurtling, Rāghava uttered a blessing over it: “May
  well-being be to Lakṣmaṇa; become futile—your effort thwarted!”
'34': >-
  Yet in battle, released in wrath by Rāvaṇa, like a venomous serpent, that
  spear sank into Lakṣmaṇa, though he was not afraid and did not flinch.
'35': >-
  With immense force it struck Lakṣmaṇa upon his broad chest—blazing with great
  splendour like the tongue of the king of serpents.
'36': >-
  Then, his heart pierced by that spear driven deep by the impetus of Rāvaṇa,
  Lakṣmaṇa fell upon the earth.
'37': >-
  Seeing Lakṣmaṇa lying in that condition, Rāghava, standing nearby, became
  heavy-hearted with grief, out of brotherly affection—though he was of great
  radiance.
'38': >-
  Brooding as if for a moment, his eyes clouded with tears, he became yet more
  fiercely enraged—like fire at the end of an age.
'39': >-
  Thinking, “This is no time for despair,” Rāghava, resolved upon the slaying of
  Rāvaṇa, waged a most terrible battle—after looking upon Lakṣmaṇa with great
  effort and utmost care.
'40': >-
  Then Rāma beheld in the great combat Lakṣmaṇa, split by the spear, smeared
  with blood, and motionless like a mountain with serpents upon it.
'41': >-
  Even that spear, hurled by the stronger Rāvaṇa, those foremost of the
  Hari-warriors could not, despite their efforts, beat down.
'42': >-
  And battered as they were by torrents of arrows from that foremost of
  rākṣasas, the spear, after piercing Saumitri, plunged into the surface of the
  earth.
'43': >-
  Grasping with both hands that fearsome spear, Rāma, mighty and enraged in the
  battle, broke it and dragged it out.
'44': >-
  While he was wrenching out the spear, the stronger Rāvaṇa shot, into all his
  limbs, arrows that pierced the vital parts.
'45': >-
  Ignoring those arrows, and embracing Lakṣmaṇa, he spoke to Hanumān and to
  Sugrīva, the great monkey:
'46': >-
  “Stand thus, O best of vānaras, encircling Lakṣmaṇa. The long-desired moment
  for my valour has now arrived.”
'47': >-
  “Let this sinful-souled Ten-necked one, fixed in wicked resolve, be slain. For
  me, the sight of him is as welcome as, to the cātaka bird, the beholding of
  clouds at the end of the hot season.”
'48': >-
  “Within this very moment, and before long, I truly promise you: you vānaras
  shall behold the world either without Rāvaṇa or without Rāma.”
'49': >-
  “The loss of the kingdom, the dwelling in the forest, the wandering in
  Daṇḍaka, the outrage to Vaidehī, and the encounter with the rākṣasas—”
'50': >-
  “the terrible and grievous suffering that befell me, and the hardship like
  unto hell—today I shall cast it all away, having slain Rāvaṇa in battle.”
'51': >-
  “For the sake of which this vānara army was gathered by me; for the sake of
  which Sugrīva was established in his kingdom after Vālin was slain in battle;
  and for the sake of which the ocean was crossed and a bridge was bound across
  the sea—”
'52': >-
  “that sinner is now before my eyes in battle. Having come within range of my
  sight, he does not deserve to live.”
'53': >-
  “Rāvaṇa has come into my gaze like the sight of a serpent that is itself
  poison; or like a snake that has come into the sight of Vainateya (Garuḍa).”
'54': >-
  “Watch with ease, O unconquerable chiefs of vānaras, this battle of mine and
  Rāvaṇa’s, seated upon the mountain peaks.”
'55': >-
  “Today, in my combat, let the three worlds—together with Gandharvas, gods,
  ṛṣis, and Cāraṇas—behold Rāma’s very ‘Rāma-hood’.”
'56': >-
  “Today I shall perform a deed which all worlds, moving and unmoving, and the
  gods, will speak of so long as the earth endures—how, assembling together,
  such a battle was waged in the world.”
'57': >-
  Having spoken thus, Rāma, composed and intent, struck Ten-necked in battle
  with sharp arrows adorned with heated gold.
'58': >-
  And then Rāvaṇa, with blazing nārācas and with heavy clubs as well, showered
  Rāma—like a rain-cloud pouring forth its streams.
'59': >-
  As the excellent arrows discharged by Rāma and Rāvaṇa struck one another down,
  there arose a tumultuous sound.
'60': >-
  The shafts of Rāma and Rāvaṇa, severed and scattered, fell upon the earth from
  the sky, their points aflame.
'61': >-
  The great twang and thunder of the bow-strings of Rāma and Rāvaṇa became
  terrifying to all beings, wondrous in its likeness.
'62': >-
  Smitten by the great-souled one—he of the blazing bow—through showers of
  arrow-nets, Rāvaṇa fled in fear, just as a cloud is driven away when struck by
  the wind.
'63': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-first Sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, called “The Casting of the Spear upon
  Lakṣmaṇa.”
