  Now begins the eighty-seventh canto in Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The inquiry concerning Rāma’s resting-place and the like.”
'1': >-
  Hearing Guha’s words—most grievous and altogether unwelcome—Bharata fell into
  deep thought, on that very spot where he had heard that painful report.
'2': >-
  He was delicate and tender, yet endowed with great prowess; lion-shouldered,
  long-armed; with large lotus-like eyes—youthful and pleasing to behold.
'3': >-
  After a brief moment, having somewhat regained himself, yet exceedingly
  downcast, he suddenly sank down, like an elephant pierced in the heart by the
  goad’s sharp point.
'4': >-
  Seeing Bharata thus fallen senseless, Guha, his face drained of color, became
  distressed there, like a tree trembling when the earth quakes.
'5': >-
  Śatrughna, who stood close behind, beholding Bharata in that state, embraced
  him and wept aloud—bereft of sense, wasted by grief.
'6': >-
  Then all those mothers of Bharata came together—emaciated through fasting,
  wretched, and worn down by the calamity that had befallen their husband.
'7': >-
  Weeping, they surrounded him as he lay fallen upon the ground; but Kauśalyā,
  following after him, sorrowful at heart, clasped him close.
'8': >-
  That ascetic lady, full of motherly affection, held her own child to her bosom
  as a cow embraces her calf, and—eager with sorrowful longing—questioned
  Bharata while weeping:
'9': >-
  “My son, surely no illness afflicts you, no bodily disorder troubles you? For
  today the very life of this royal house truly depends upon you.”
'10': >-
  “Seeing you, my son, I live, now that Rāma has gone to the forest together
  with his brothers; and since king Daśaratha has passed away, you alone are our
  protector today.”
'11': >-
  “Has anything unpleasant, my son, been heard concerning Lakṣmaṇa? Or
  concerning my son—the son of her who has but one son—who has gone to the
  forest together with his wife?”
'12': >-
  Then that illustrious Bharata, after a moment recovering himself, and still
  weeping, consoled Kauśalyā and spoke these words to Guha:
'13': >-
  “Where did my brother spend the night? Where were Sītā and where was Lakṣmaṇa?
  Upon what bed did he sleep? What did he eat? Tell me, Guha.”
'14': >-
  Thus questioned by Bharata, Guha, the lord of the Niṣādas, told him in what
  manner he had received and honored Rāma—dear to him and beneficial—as an
  honored guest.
'15': >-
  “Food of many kinds—both choice and plain—along with various fruits as well,
  in great abundance, was brought by me for Rāma to partake of.”
'16': >-
  “But all that Rāma—of truthful valor—declined; for, remembering the duty of a
  kṣatriya, he would not accept it.”
'17': >-
  “‘From us, friend, nothing should be accepted; rather, it is we who must
  always give.’ By such words, O king, were we persuaded by that great-souled
  one.”
'18': >-
  “Then the glorious scion of the Raghus, after drinking water brought by
  Lakṣmaṇa, observed the fast, together with Sītā.”
'19': >-
  “Thereafter, with the water that remained, Lakṣmaṇa also did likewise; and
  those three, with speech restrained and minds composed, worshipped the
  twilight rites with due attention.”
'20': >-
  “Then, afterwards, Saumitrī prepared an auspicious bed of grass, himself
  quickly bringing blades of kuśa and other grass, for the sake of Rāghava.”
'21': >-
  “Rāma lay down upon that bed together with Sītā; and Lakṣmaṇa, having washed
  their feet, stepped away.”
'22': >-
  “This indeed is the root of the ingudī tree, and this very spot of grass—where
  both Rāma and Sītā slept through that night.”
'23': >-
  “Restraining himself—placing his back upon the ground—his fingers guarding the
  bow-string’s readiness; with his two quivers filled full of arrows, bearing
  great austerity; drawing near his mighty bow kept strung, Lakṣmaṇa alone kept
  vigil all around him through the night.”
'24': >-
  “And then I too, bearing an excellent bow and arrows, remained stationed there
  where Lakṣmaṇa stood; and with tireless kinsmen, their bows in hand, we
  guarded him then—Rāma, who was like unto great Indra.”
'25': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-seventh canto in Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The inquiry concerning Rāma’s
  resting-place and the like.”
