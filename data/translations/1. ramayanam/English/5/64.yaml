  Now begins the Sixty-fourth Canto in the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Arrival of Hanumān and the Others.”
'1': >-
  Thus addressed by Sugrīva, the monkey Dadhimukha, delighted at heart, paid
  obeisance to Rāghava and to Lakṣmaṇa, and also to Sugrīva.
'2': >-
  Having bowed low to Sugrīva and to the two mighty-armed Rāghavas, and
  accompanied by the heroic monkeys, he sprang up into the very sky.
'3': >-
  Even as he had come before, so did he go back in haste; descending from the
  sky to the earth, he entered that forest.
'4': >-
  Having entered the honey-grove, he beheld all the monkey leaders—free from
  intoxication now, no longer unruly—still in the act of drinking the
  honey-liquor.
'5': >-
  That valiant one approached them, joining his hands in reverent salutation,
  and spoke these gentle words to Aṅgada, who was rejoicing:
'6': >-
  “Gentle one, you ought not to give way to wrath on account of the restraint
  imposed by these guards. Through ignorance and in anger, you were prevented by
  the watchmen.
'7': >-
  “Worn out after coming from far away, drink your own honey as you please. You
  are the heir-apparent and the lord of this forest, O mighty one.
'8': >-
  “The anger that was shown earlier out of folly—yourself should pardon that.
  For just as your father formerly was the sovereign of the monkey hosts,
'9': >-
  “so too are you—along with Sugrīva and none other—O best of monkeys. For I
  have gone and informed your uncle, O sinless one.
'10': >-
  “All these forest-dwellers were setting out from there at once, on hearing of
  your coming, together with these forest-ranging monkeys.
'11': >-
  “Far from being angry, he was delighted when he heard that the grove had been
  assailed. Your uncle Sugrīva, lord of monkeys, was pleased with me.
'12': >-
  “The king said, ‘Send them all quickly.’ Hearing this gentle speech of
  Dadhimukha, Aṅgada—
'13': >-
  the foremost of monkeys, skilled in speech—said to those monkey leaders: ‘I
  suspect this tidings has been heard by Rāma.
'14': >-
  ‘And this one, out of joy, reports it; by that sign I know the reason.
  Therefore it is not proper for us to remain here when the task is
  accomplished, O tormenters of foes.
'15': >-
  ‘Having drunk honey to your hearts’ content, O valiant forest-dwellers, what
  remains to be done here? Let us go there where Sugrīva the monkey is.’
'16': >-
  ‘In whatever manner the foremost of monkeys, assembling together, shall speak
  to me, in that same manner will I act in what is to be done; I am dependent
  upon you.’
'17': >-
  ‘Even though I am the heir-apparent, I have no authority to command. It is
  improper for you—who have accomplished the work—to be forcibly assailed.’
'18': >-
  As Aṅgada spoke thus, hearing his excellent words, the forest-dwelling
  monkeys, their minds delighted, spoke this:
'19': >-
  “O king, what lord—though a bull among monkeys—would speak in such a way? For
  one intoxicated with power thinks, ‘I alone am everything.’”
'20': >-
  “This speech of yours is most befitting you, and of no one else. Your humility
  proclaims your fitness for auspicious sovereignty in the future.”
'21': >-
  “We too have all arrived, ready this very moment to go there—where Sugrīva,
  the imperishable lord of monkey-heroes, is.”
'22': >-
  “Without monkeys like you giving the lead, O best of monkeys, it is not
  possible to go step by step anywhere at all. This we tell you as the truth.”
'23': >-
  When they spoke thus, Aṅgada replied to them; saying, “Good! Let us go,” those
  mighty ones rose up into the sky.
'24': >-
  After him as he soared, all those monkey chiefs soared as well, making the
  open sky seem no open sky—like stones flung upward by a machine.
'25': >-
  Placing Aṅgada in front and Hanumān the monkey as well, those swift-moving
  monkeys leapt up together into the firmament.
'26': >-
  Uttering a great roaring sound, like clouds driven by the wind—when Aṅgada
  arrived, Sugrīva, lord of monkeys,
'27': >-
  said to Rāma of lotus-eyes, who was afflicted with grief: “Take
  comfort—blessings upon you! The lady has been seen; there is no doubt.”
'28': >-
  “It is not possible for them to come here after the appointed time has passed;
  and from Aṅgada’s very exhilaration I know it, O you of auspicious
  countenance.
'29': >-
  “If the affair had ended in failure, the mighty-armed Aṅgada—best among those
  who leap—would not come into my presence.
'30': >-
  “Even if such an attempt were made by those whose business was not
  accomplished, his face would be downcast, his mind confused and overwhelmed.”
'31': >-
  “This honey-grove is ancestral—guarded by our forefathers. Hanumān would not
  damage my honey-grove unless he had seen the daughter of Janaka.”
'32': >-
  “Rāma, noble son of Kauśalyā, take comfort, O you of excellent vows. The lady
  has been seen—there is no doubt—and by none other than Hanumān.”
'33': >-
  “For there is no other cause for the accomplishment of this deed by Hanumān.
  In Hanumān here are success and counsel—O best of the wise.”
'34': >-
  “Resolve and valor, and established renown as well—where Jāmbavān is leader,
  and Aṅgada is lord among monkeys,
'35': >-
  and Hanumān too is the chief—there the course cannot be otherwise. Therefore
  do not be joined to anxiety now, O you of immeasurable prowess.”
'36': >-
  “For when the forest-dwellers, proud and high-spirited, gather together, such
  conduct would not occur among those who have not accomplished their task.”
'37': >-
  “From the breaking of the forest and from the eating of the honey I know it.”
  Then he heard, close in the sky, a loud, tumultuous chattering sound—
'38': >-
  of the forest-dwelling monkeys, exulting in Hanumān’s feat, roaring as though
  proclaiming their success as they drew near to Kiṣkindhā.
'39': >-
  Then, hearing that roar of the monkeys, Sugrīva—the best of monkeys—his long
  tail arched and curved, became glad of heart.
'40': >-
  Those monkeys too came, longing for the sight of Rāma, placing Aṅgada in front
  and Hanumān the monkey as well.
'41': >-
  Those heroes, led by Aṅgada—delighted and filled with joy—alighted near the
  monkey-king and near Rāghava.
'42': >-
  Then Hanumān, mighty-armed, bowed his head in reverence and reported to
  Rāghava: “The lady is seen—unfailing and unharmed.”
'43': >-
  Hearing from Hanumān’s mouth words like nectar—“The lady has been seen”—Rāma,
  together with Lakṣmaṇa, attained great joy.
'44': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, his purpose now assured with regard to that son of the Wind,
  looked upon Sugrīva with affection—pleased and honoring him.
'45': >-
  And Rāghava, slayer of hostile heroes, filled with supreme delight, looked
  upon Hanumān with great respect and high regard.
'46': >-
  Thus ends the Sixty-fourth Canto in the Sundara Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Arrival of Hanumān and the Others.”
