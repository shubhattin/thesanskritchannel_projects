  Now, in the holy Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Uttara-Kanda, begins the twentieth
  canto, called “Ravana’s Incitement to Battle.”
'1': >-
  Thereafter the lord of the Rakshasas, terrifying the mortals upon the earth,
  came upon Narada, the foremost of sages, amid those dense clouds.
'2': >-
  Having made his salutation to him, Dashagriva—Ravana, the ranger of the
  night—spoke, asking after his welfare and also the reason for his coming.
'3': >-
  But Narada, of mighty splendour—the divine seer of immeasurable radiance—spoke
  to Ravana, who was seated in Pushpaka, while he himself stood upon the back of
  a cloud.
'4': >-
  “O gentle lord of Rakshasas, stand firm, O son of Vishravas. I am pleased with
  you—endowed as you are with noble lineage and with exploits made powerful by
  your valour.
'5': >-
  “By your combats—by your clashes with Vishnu, by your slayings of the Daityas,
  and by your overpowering of Gandharvas and Nagas—I am indeed greatly
  satisfied.
'6': >-
  “Moreover, I shall say something to you. It is to be listened to, if you will
  indeed listen. And having heard it, you must then act upon it, O best of
  Rakshasas. Therefore, as I speak, dear one, fix your full attention upon
  hearing.”
'7': >-
  “Why, dear one, do you slay this world—when you are yourself invulnerable to
  the gods? For this world is in truth already slain when it has come under the
  power of Death.”
'8': >-
  “Of the gods, Danavas, Daityas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, and Rakshasas—by you, who
  are invulnerable, it is fitting that those hosts be afflicted; not so this
  human world.”
'9': >-
  “Ever deluded even with regard to what is truly beneficial, encompassed by
  great calamities—who would strike such a world, laden with hundreds of old
  ages and diseases?”
'10': >-
  “Where, at one time or another and in every place, with ceaseless approaches
  of misfortunes of this sort—what wise man in the world of men would seek love
  for battle there?”
'11': >-
  “Wasting away, smitten by destiny, afflicted by hunger, thirst, old age, and
  the like; confounded by despondency and grief—do not you destroy this world.”
'12': >-
  “Look then, O mighty-armed one, O lord of Rakshasas, upon mankind—thus
  deluded, intent on diverse aims, whose final course is not understood.”
'13': >-
  “In some places, music, dance, and the like are pursued by men who are joyful;
  and by others, afflicted, there is weeping—faces and eyes streaming with
  torrents of tears.”
'14': >-
  “Enchanted by affection for mother, father, and son, by a wife delightful to
  the mind, and by kinsmen—this people, though being ruined, do not comprehend
  their own distress.”
'15': >-
  “Enough of tormenting this world, whose delusion is not removed. You have
  already conquered, O gentle one, the mortal world—of this there is no doubt.”
'16': >-
  “By all these beings it is inevitably to be gone to the abode of Yama.
  Therefore, restrain Yama, O Paulastya, O conqueror of enemy-cities.”
'17': >-
  “When he is conquered, all is conquered indeed—there is no doubt. Thus
  addressed, the lord of Lanka, blazing with his own splendour, spoke there to
  Narada, smiling and after paying him reverence:”
'18': >-
  “O great sage, who move among gods and Gandharvas, and who are fond of war—I
  am prepared to go to Rasatala for the sake of victory.”
'19': >-
  “Then, having conquered the three worlds and having brought the Nagas and the
  gods under my control, I shall churn the ocean—the abode of Rasas—for the sake
  of nectar.”
'20': >-
  Then Narada, the blessed seer, spoke to Dashagriva: “By what path indeed is it
  now possible for you to go—by some other way?”
'21': >-
  “This way indeed is exceedingly hard to traverse, leading to the city of the
  lord of the departed. It is a path difficult to assail—belonging to Yama, O
  subduer of foes.”
'22': >-
  Then Dashanana, releasing a laugh like a rain-cloud in autumn, said, “So be
  it,” and further spoke these words:
'23': >-
  “Therefore, O Brahman, intent upon slaying Vaivasvata, I go to the southern
  quarter, where the king—son of the Sun—abides.”
'24': >-
  “For, O Blessed One, in wrath I—one who strives for battle—have vowed: ‘I
  shall subdue the four Lokapalas,’ O Lord.”
'25': >-
  “Thus am I set forth, indeed, toward the city of the lord of the dead; that
  bringer of anguish to living beings I shall yoke to death.”
'26': >-
  Having spoken thus, Dashagriva saluted that sage; and with his ministers he
  proceeded into the southern quarter, advancing onward.
'27': >-
  But Narada, of mighty splendour, for a moment assumed meditation; and the
  foremost of Brahmans reflected—like a smokeless fire.
'28': >-
  “He by whom the three worlds with Indra, with all that moves and all that is
  unmoving, are afflicted—and who, when their lifespan is exhausted according to
  dharma, is Time—how is that Time to be conquered?”
'29': >-
  “He who is a witness to one’s gifts and one’s deeds, like a second fire; by
  regaining awareness of whom the worlds are conquered—that great-souled one…,”
'30': >-
  “—he before whom the three worlds ever flee, tormented by fear—how will that
  Rakshasa king go of his own accord (to overcome him)?”
'31': >-
  “He who is the Ordainer and the Sustainer, and who also (apportions) merit and
  demerit; by whom the three worlds are governed—how will he be vanquished?”
'32': >-
  “Yet, having devised some other means, he will contrive an arrangement.
  Curiosity has arisen in me; I shall go to the abode of Yama,”
'33': '“—to behold for myself the clash between those two: Yama and the Rakshasa.”'
'34': >-
  Thus ends the twentieth canto in the Uttara-Kanda of the holy
  Valmiki-Ramayana, the primeval epic, entitled “Ravana’s Incitement to Battle.”
