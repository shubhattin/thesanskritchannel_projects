  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-seventh chapter, named “Rāvaṇa’s Insolent Address (to Sītā).”
'1': >-
  Then Vaidehī (Sītā), being questioned by Rāvaṇa, who desired to carry her
  away, while he stood in the guise of a wandering mendicant, spoke of herself
  in her own words.
'2': >-
  Reflecting for a moment, “If this one is a brāhmaṇa and a guest, and if I do
  not answer him, he may indeed curse me,” Sītā spoke these words.
'3': >-
  “I am the daughter of great-souled Janaka of Mithilā; my name is Sītā. Fortune
  be to you. I am the beloved, chief consort of Rāma.”
'4': >-
  “Having dwelt for twelve full years in the abode of the Ikṣvāku line, enjoying
  human pleasures, endowed with every desired prosperity—”
'5': >-
  “Then, in the thirteenth year, the sovereign lord (Daśaratha), having
  conferred with his royal ministers assembled together, made ready to
  consecrate Rāma.”
'6': >-
  “While that consecration of Rāghava was being set in motion, my venerable
  lady, named Kaikeyī, asked her husband for a boon.”
'7': >-
  “Having won over my father-in-law by some past good deed of mine, Kaikeyī
  sought my banishment and the consecration of Bharata, her son, as king.”
'8': >-
  “She begged those two things of her husband—the best of kings, resolute in
  truth—saying, ‘Today I shall neither eat nor sleep nor drink—never!’”
'9': >-
  “‘This will be the end of my life if Rāma is consecrated!’ Thus speaking,
  Kaikeyī—(and) that king, my father-in-law—”
'10': >-
  “—tried to dissuade her with fitting and reasonable pleadings, yet she did not
  withdraw her demand. My husband, of great splendor, was then twenty-five years
  of age.”
'11': >-
  “Eighteen years are counted from the time of my birth (to that time). Rāma is
  famed in the world as truthful, well-conducted, and pure.”
'12': >-
  “Lotus-eyed, mighty-armed, devoted to the welfare of all beings—yet my father,
  the great king Daśaratha himself, distressed by desire (for Kaikeyī’s wish)—”
'13': >-
  “—did not consecrate that Rāma in order to fulfill what was dear to Kaikeyī.
  But when Rāma came near his father for the consecration—”
'14': >-
  “—Kaikeyī spoke hastily to my husband, saying: ‘Hear this, O Rāghava—this is
  what your father has commanded.’”
'15': >-
  “‘This kingdom, free from thorns (from troubles and foes), must be given to
  Bharata; but you must dwell in the forest for nine years and five.’”
'16': >-
  “‘Depart to the forest, O Kakutstha, and free your father from falsehood!’
  Thus addressed, Rāma, fearless, replied to Kaikeyī, ‘So be it.’”
'17': >-
  “Hearing those words, my husband, firm in vow, carried them out—for his rule
  is: one should give and not take; one should speak truth and not falsehood.”
'18': >-
  “Such, O brāhmaṇa, is the unsurpassed vow upheld by Rāma. And his brother,
  born of another mother, is the valiant one named Lakṣmaṇa—”
'19': >-
  “—a tiger among men, Rāma’s companion, a slayer of foes in battle. That
  brother, named Lakṣmaṇa, is a brahmacārin, steadfast in his vow.”
'20': >-
  “Bow in hand, he followed him who was going forth into exile, together with
  me—he, with matted hair, in the guise of an ascetic, along with me and with
  his elder brother.”
'21': >-
  “Entering the Daṇḍaka forest, ever devoted to dharma and firm in vow, we three
  were driven from the kingdom for the sake of Kaikeyī.”
'22': >-
  “We wander, O best of twice-born, through this deep forest by our own
  strength. Take heart for a moment; it is possible for you to dwell here.”
'23': >-
  “My husband will return, bringing abundant forest fare—having slain rurus
  (deer), iguanas, and boars, and bringing much meat.”
'24': >-
  “So tell me truly your name and your gotra and your lineage; and why do you,
  alone in the Daṇḍaka forest, roam about, O twice-born one?”
'25': >-
  Thus, while Sītā, Rāma’s wife, was speaking, the mighty Rāvaṇa, lord of the
  rākṣasas, answered her with harsh and cutting words.
'26': >-
  “He by whom the worlds have been made to tremble—together with gods, asuras,
  and men—I am he, named Rāvaṇa, O Sītā, the overlord of the rākṣasa hosts.”
'27': >-
  “But seeing you, golden-hued, clad in silk, O blameless one, I find no delight
  in my own wives.”
'28': >-
  “Many excellent women, brought from here and there—yet, fortune be to you,
  become my foremost queen above them all.”
'29': >-
  “In the midst of the ocean is my great city named Laṅkā, encircled by the sea
  and built upon a mountain summit.”
'30': >-
  “There, O Sītā, you shall roam with me among groves and pleasure-woods; and
  you will not long for this life of forest-dwelling, O passionate lady.”
'31': >-
  “Five thousand maidservants, all adorned with every ornament, O Sītā, will
  wait upon you—if you become my wife.”
'32': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāvaṇa, Janaka’s daughter, angered, the faultless-limbed
  lady replied, disregarding that rākṣasa:
'33': >-
  “My husband is like a great mountain, unshakable; like Mahendra himself; like
  the great ocean, unagitated. I am devoted to Rāma alone.”
'34': >-
  “Endowed with every auspicious mark, broad as a banyan’s spreading shade, true
  to his vows, most fortunate— I am devoted to Rāma alone.”
'35': >-
  “Mighty-armed, broad-chested, moving with the stride of a lion; a man-lion,
  lion-like in splendor— I am devoted to Rāma alone.”
'36': >-
  “Rāma is moon-faced like the full moon, a princely darling, self-restrained,
  of wide renown, mighty-armed— I am devoted to Rāma alone.”
'37': >-
  “But you are a jackal, desiring me here, a rare lioness. You are not able to
  touch me—like the radiance of the sun.”
'38': >-
  “Surely, ill-fated one, you behold many golden trees (in your delusion), since
  you, O rākṣasa, desire the beloved wife of Rāghava.”
'39': >-
  “From the mouth of a hungry lion—swift, the enemy of beasts—(it is as though)
  you wish to pluck out a fang; (or) from the mouth of a deadly serpent you wish
  to take its tooth.”
'40': >-
  “You wish to carry off Mandara, best of mountains, with your hand; having
  drunk the poison Kālakūṭa, you wish to go forth unharmed.”
'41': >-
  “With a needle you would rub your eye; with your tongue you would lick a
  razor—(even so) you wish to attain the beloved wife of Rāghava!”
'42': >-
  “Hanging a stone upon your neck, you wish to cross the ocean; with your two
  hands you wish to seize and carry off both the sun and the moon.”
'43': >-
  “You who wish to violate the beloved wife of Rāma—having seen a blazing fire,
  you wish to snatch it up with a cloth.”
'44': >-
  “You who wish to carry off Rāma’s wife, whose conduct is auspicious—(it is as
  though) you wish to walk upon the points of spears with iron mouths. You who
  wish to attain a wife like that of Rāma—”
'45': >-
  “As is the distance in the forest between a lion and a jackal; as is the
  distance between a chariot and the ocean; as is the difference between the
  finest liquor and sour beer—such indeed is the difference between Daśaratha’s
  son and you!”
'46': >-
  “As is the difference between gold and lead or iron; as is the difference
  between sandalwood and muddy water; as is the difference in the forest between
  an elephant and a cat—such indeed is the difference between Daśaratha’s son
  and you!”
'47': >-
  “As is the difference between a crow and Garuḍa; as is the difference between
  a madgu bird and a peacock; as is the difference in the forest between a swan
  and a vulture—such indeed is the difference between Daśaratha’s son and you!”
'48': >-
  “While Rāma—whose might equals that of the thousand-eyed Indra—stands with bow
  and arrows in hand, even if I were carried away by you, I would not submit to
  you, like ghee that has been vomited up by a fly.”
'49': >-
  Having thus spoken—she of blameless disposition—uttering those most wicked
  words to that night-ranging demon, slender Sītā became distressed from
  trembling in her limbs, like a plantain tree shaken by the wind.
'50': >-
  Perceiving Sītā trembling, Rāvaṇa—terrible as Death—set forth to her his own
  lineage, his strength, his name, and his deeds, for the sake of causing fear.
'51': >-
  Thus ends the forty-seventh chapter in the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the first among poems, entitled “Rāvaṇa’s Insolent Address.”
