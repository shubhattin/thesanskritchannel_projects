  Now begins the sixtieth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Awakening of Kumbhakarṇa.”
'1': >-
  Entering the city of Laṅkā, the king—tormented by fear of Rāma’s arrows—his
  pride shattered, then became distressed in all his senses.
'2': >-
  Like an elephant overcome by a lion, or a serpent by Garuḍa, the king was
  overpowered by great-souled Rāghava.
'3': >-
  Remembering Rāghava’s arrows—like the rod of Brahmā in their dread aspect, and
  gleaming with a splendour like flashing lightning—the lord of rākṣasas was
  sorely shaken.
'4': >-
  Taking refuge upon a divine throne of gold, the supreme seat, Rāvaṇa, while
  looking about at the rākṣasas, spoke these words:
'5': >-
  “All that austere penance of mine—severe, surpassing penance—is indeed
  fruitless, since I, who was the equal of Mahendra, have been vanquished by a
  mere man.”
'6': >-
  “This is that terrible utterance of Brahmā that has now come upon me in full:
  ‘Know fear from men.’ And so it has proved.”
'7': >-
  “From gods, dānavas, gandharvas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, and serpents I sought and
  obtained the boon of inviolability; from men I did not ask it.”
'8': >-
  “I deem this Rāma, son of Daśaratha, to be that very man—born in the Ikṣvāku
  line—of whom long ago that Araṇya (Araṇya-ṛṣi) had spoken.”
'9': >-
  “‘There will arise in my lineage a man, the vilest among rākṣasas, who will
  slay you in battle—you together with your sons, your counsellors, your forces,
  and even with your horses and charioteers.’”
'10': >-
  “He will strike you down in war, O disgrace of your race, O evil-minded one.’
  Thus was I cursed by Vedavatī, because she was formerly violated.”
'11': >-
  “This very Sītā, the greatly fortunate one, has been born as Janaka’s
  daughter—(she who is) Umā; and (she who is) Nandīśvara as well; and Rambhā,
  the daughter of Varuṇa.”
'12': >-
  “As was spoken (then), so has it come upon me now; the word of the seer is not
  false. Therefore, having realized this, you must make effort here and now.”
'13': >-
  “Let the rākṣasas also take their stations—moving along the ramparts and the
  tops of the city-gates. And he—of incomparable depth, the destroyer of the
  pride of gods and dānavas—(is upon us).”
'14': >-
  “Kumbhakarṇa, oppressed by Brahmā’s curse, must be awakened—(for) in battle
  Prahasta has been overcome and slain.”
'15': >-
  Knowing the terrible might of the rākṣasa host, the mighty one issued
  commands: “Let vigilance be exercised at the gates; and let the ramparts be
  mounted.”
'16': >-
  “Kumbhakarṇa, sunk under the dominion of sleep, must be awakened. He sleeps
  happily, without anxiety, his senses clouded by desire.”
'17': >-
  “That rākṣasa sleeps for nine, seven, ten, or eight months. Having performed
  the prescribed rite (mantra), he has fallen asleep; and from now it is the
  ninth day.”
'18': >-
  “But quickly awaken Kumbhakarṇa, of great might. For that mighty-armed one in
  battle is the very crest-pole of all rākṣasas; he will swiftly slay the
  vānaras and the two princes as well.”
'19': >-
  “He is the banner in the supreme contest, indeed the foremost of all
  rākṣasas—Kumbhakarṇa—who ever lies asleep, deluded, devoted to coarse, rustic
  pleasures.”
'20': >-
  “In this most dreadful battle, where I have been hard pressed by Rāma, there
  will be no sorrow for me once Kumbhakarṇa is awakened.”
'21': >-
  “What use is one whose strength equals Indra’s, if in such a terrible calamity
  he is not fit to give aid?”
'22': >-
  Hearing those words of the lord of rākṣasas, the rākṣasas went—utterly
  agitated—to Kumbhakarṇa’s dwelling.
'23': >-
  Those flesh-and-blood-eaters, commanded by Rāvaṇa, hastily went, taking
  perfumes, garlands, and abundant, choice food.
'24': >-
  Entering that mighty gateway—spreading a yojana in every direction—they went
  into Kumbhakarṇa’s charming cavern, through which the scent of flowers
  drifted.
'25': >-
  Buffeted by the breath of Kumbhakarṇa, those mighty ones, with difficulty and
  with great effort, managed to enter the cavern.
'26': >-
  Having entered that delightful cave, paved with jewels and gold, those
  tiger-like rākṣasas beheld him—of dreadful valour—lying asleep.
'27': >-
  Gathering together, they tried to awaken Kumbhakarṇa, sunk in vast
  slumber—distorted in form, like a mountain strewn apart.
'28': >-
  His body bristling with hairs, breathing like a serpent, and with his
  exhalations whirling about (the air), he lay there, of fearsome prowess.
'29': >-
  They saw him with terrifying nostrils, with a mouth as vast as the
  netherworld, his whole body laid upon the couch, reeking of fat and blood.
'30': >-
  They beheld that tiger among rākṣasas—Kumbhakarṇa, crusher of foes—his body
  bound with golden armlets, crowned with a diadem radiant as the sun.
'31': >-
  Then, before great-souled Kumbhakarṇa, they made a heap like Mount Meru
  itself—an excellent offering meant to satisfy (him).
'32': >-
  Those lion-like rākṣasas also piled together herds of deer, buffaloes, and
  boars, and made an astonishing mound of food.
'33': >-
  Then they placed in front of Kumbhakarṇa pots of blood and various kinds of
  flesh—the enemies of the gods.
'34': >-
  They anointed that scorcher of foes with precious sandal paste, and comforted
  him with divine garlands and fragrant perfumes.
'35': >-
  They sent forth clouds of incense, and praised that scorcher of foes; and the
  yātudhānas roared from place to place like thunder-clouds.
'36': >-
  They filled conches shining like the moon; and all at once, enraged, they made
  a tumult and a mighty din.
'37': >-
  Those night-rangers shouted, clapped, and hurled themselves about; for
  awakening Kumbhakarṇa they raised a vast uproar.
'38': >-
  Hearing that sound—of conches, kettledrums, and tabors; of clappings,
  howlings, and lion-roars—so that the quarters fled, and the very heaven was as
  though being showered upon, the birds suddenly fell down (in terror).
'39': >-
  When even with those furious clamours the great-souled Kumbhakarṇa did not
  wake but slept on, then all those troops of rākṣasas seized bhūśuṇḍīs, clubs,
  and maces.
'40': >-
  With mountain-peaks, clubs, and maces; with blows upon his chest; with mallets
  and fists—those fierce rākṣasas struck Kumbhakarṇa as he lay on the ground in
  happy sleep.
'41': >-
  By the wind of Kumbhakarṇa’s breath, those rākṣasas could not stand before him
  (near his face).
'42': >-
  Then those rākṣasas of dreadful prowess brought close and forcefully (played)
  drums and tabors, kettledrums, conches, and great pot-drums as well.
'43': >-
  Ten thousand rākṣasas surrounded him all at once—him whose form was like a
  mass of dark collyrium—and tried to rouse him.
'44': >-
  Though they struck him and shouted, he did not awaken then; and when they
  could not rouse him, (they grew desperate) again.
'45': >-
  Then they undertook a heavier and more dreadful effort: they drove on horses,
  camels, asses, and elephants, striking them with staffs and goads.
'46': >-
  They sounded conches, kettledrums, and drums with all their might, and struck
  his limbs with great logs and clubs of wood.
'47': >-
  With mallets and clubs too, raised with full force, they beat (upon him). By
  that mighty clamour all Laṅkā was filled—mountains and forests included—yet
  even then he did not wake.
'48': >-
  Then a thousand kettledrums were beaten all at once, their corners plated with
  polished gold, hung all around without slack.
'49': >-
  Even so, though sunk in excessive sleep, when he still did not awaken—having
  fallen under the power of the curse—the night-rangers became wrathful.
'50': >-
  Then all those of dreadful prowess, seized by anger, resolved upon other
  exertions in order to awaken that rākṣasa.
'51': >-
  Some struck the kettledrums; others made a great noise. Some pulled at his
  hair; others bit his ears.
'52': >-
  Others poured hundreds of pots of water into his ears. Kumbhakarṇa did not
  stir, overcome by vast slumber.
'53': >-
  Others, strong men with heavy spiked mallets in their hands, rained down those
  mallets upon his head, chest, and limbs.
'54': >-
  Bound all around with rope-bonds and struck with heavy iron-bludgeons, that
  huge-bodied rākṣasa still did not awaken.
'55': >-
  A thousand elephants ran over his body; then Kumbhakarṇa, perceiving the
  touch, began to awaken fully.
'56': >-
  Not minding those immense blows from falling mountain-peaks and trees, and
  tormented by hunger when his sleep wore away, he yawned and suddenly sprang
  up.
'57': >-
  Flinging out his arms like coils of a serpent or the peaks of a mountain—his
  limbs hard as thunderbolt—he opened his mouth like the mouth of the submarine
  fire, and that night-ranger yawned in a hideous manner.
'58': >-
  As he yawned, his mouth, resembling the netherworld, appeared like the sun
  risen upon the summit of Mount Meru.
'59': >-
  Yawning, of exceeding strength, that night-ranger—now awakened—gave forth a
  breath that arose like a wind from a mountain.
'60': >-
  As Kumbhakarṇa rose up, his form appeared like that of Time (Kāla) at the end
  of an age, intent upon consuming all beings.
'61': >-
  In that one, whose brilliance was like blazing fire and whose radiance was
  like lightning, two great eyes were seen—like two blazing planets.
'62': >-
  Then, showing (and taking) many kinds of foods in abundance, that mighty one
  devoured boars and buffaloes as well.
'63': >-
  Hungry, he took flesh; thirsty, he drank blood. Then that foe of Śakra drank
  pots of fat and jars of strong drink.
'64': >-
  Knowing that he was satisfied, the night-rangers rose up; and bowing with
  their heads, they stood around him on every side.
'65': >-
  With eyes still clear from sleep yet his gaze made turbid, he cast his look
  all around and saw those night-rangers.
'66': >-
  He soothed them all, that bull among rākṣasas; and astonished at having been
  awakened, he spoke this to the rākṣasas:
'67': >-
  “For what purpose have you, with such urgency, awakened me? Is the king well
  and safe? Or has any fear arisen here?”
'68': >-
  “Or surely some supreme danger has come from others—on account of which you
  have hastily awakened me.”
'69': >-
  “Today I shall tear out the fear of the king of rākṣasas. I shall split
  Mahendra, or even cool the very fire.”
'70': >-
  “For not for a petty cause would you awaken one like me from sleep. Therefore
  tell me, in accordance with the true matter, the reason for waking me.”
'71': >-
  As he spoke thus, fierce and a crusher of foes, Yūpākṣa, a minister of the
  king, with joined palms, addressed him:
'72': >-
  “Never do we have any fear caused by the gods. From men, O king, a dreadful
  fear now grievously oppresses us.”
'73': >-
  “We have no fear anywhere from daityas or dānavas; yet such as is this human
  fear, O king, has come upon us.”
'74': >-
  “This Laṅkā has been surrounded by vānaras shaped like mountains. From
  Rāma—burning with anguish over Sītā’s abduction—there is for us a terrible
  fear.”
'75': >-
  “Formerly this great city was burned by a single vānara. And prince Akṣa was
  slain—with his attendants and with his elephant.”
'76': >-
  “Even the lord of rākṣasas himself, the Paulastya—a thorn to the gods—was, in
  battle, sent away by Rāma, radiant as the sun.”
'77': >-
  “That which was not done to the king by the gods, nor by daityas, nor by
  dānavas—this, here, has been done by Rāma: he has been delivered from peril of
  life (only narrowly escaping).”
'78': >-
  Hearing Yūpākṣa’s words about his brother’s defeat in war, Kumbhakarṇa, his
  eyes widening, spoke this to Yūpākṣa:
'79': >-
  “This very day, Yūpākṣa, having conquered in battle the vānara host together
  with Lakṣmaṇa, and Rāghava as well, then shall I see Rāvaṇa.”
'80': >-
  “I shall sate the rākṣasas with the flesh and blood of the monkeys; and I
  myself shall drink the blood of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa too.”
'81': >-
  Hearing those words of his, boastful and with faults increased by wrath,
  Mahodara—the chief among the rākṣasa warriors—joining his palms, spoke this
  word:
'82': >-
  “Having heard Rāvaṇa’s speech, and having weighed merits and faults,
  thereafter too, O mighty-armed one, you will conquer the foes in battle.”
'83': >-
  Hearing Mahodara’s words, surrounded by rākṣasas, Kumbhakarṇa of great
  splendour and might set forth.
'84': >-
  Having roused the dreadful-eyed one, of terrible form and prowess, the
  rākṣasas hurried to the dwelling of Ten-necked Rāvaṇa.
'85': >-
  Approaching Daśagrīva, seated upon the highest throne, all those night-rangers
  spoke, their hands joined in reverence:
'86': >-
  “Kumbhakarṇa, your brother, O lord of rākṣasas, has been awakened. How shall
  you go forth there? You will see him come here.”
'87': >-
  Rāvaṇa, delighted, said to those rākṣasas who had come before him: “I wish to
  see him here; and let him be honoured as is proper.”
'88': >-
  Saying “So be it,” all those rākṣasas returned again and, urged by Rāvaṇa,
  spoke these words to Kumbhakarṇa:
'89': >-
  “The king, foremost of all rākṣasas, desires to see you. Resolve to go;
  gladden your brother.”
'90': >-
  But Kumbhakarṇa, hard to assail, obeying his brother-king’s command, said “So
  be it”; and that hero of great prowess sprang up from his couch.
'91': >-
  Washing his face, joyful—having bathed, exceedingly delighted—thirsty, he
  hastened the drink that increases strength and energy.
'92': >-
  Then, by Rāvaṇa’s order, those rākṣasas in haste promptly brought liquor and
  many kinds of foods.
'93': >-
  Having drunk two thousand jars, he prepared to set out—somewhat haughty and
  intoxicated, endowed with fiery energy and strength.
'94': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa became enraged, like Yama, the Ender of Time. Going to his
  brother’s palace, surrounded by rākṣasa forces, Kumbhakarṇa with his footsteps
  made the earth tremble.
'95': >-
  Illuminating the royal highway with his body, like the thousand-rayed sun
  illumines the earth with its beams, he went there, surrounded by a garland of
  joined palms (reverent rākṣasas), like Śatakratu going to the house of the
  Self-born (Brahmā).
'96': >-
  Seeing that foe-slayer on the royal road—immeasurable, like a
  mountain-peak—the vānaras who had come outside suddenly, together with their
  troop-leaders, were seized with terror.
'97': >-
  Some, afflicted, went to Rāma as refuge, the worthy shelter; some, distressed,
  fell down; some, frightened, fell down; and some, terror-stricken, lay upon
  the ground.
'98': >-
  Beholding him—like a mountain-peak, crowned, touching the sun as it were with
  his own splendour—the vānaras, terrified at that growing wonder, fled away in
  all directions.
'99': >-
  Thus ends the sixtieth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The Awakening of Kumbhakarṇa.”
