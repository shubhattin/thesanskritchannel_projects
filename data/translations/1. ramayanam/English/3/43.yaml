  Now begins the forty-third canto in the Aranya-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, entitled “The Resolution of Lakshmana’s Doubt.”
'1': >-
  She, the fair-hipped lady, while gathering flowers, beheld that deer—adorned
  on both its flanks with hues like gold and silver.
'2': >-
  Delighted, and with faultless limbs and a complexion like refined gold, she
  cried out to her husband, and to Lakshmana too, who stood armed.
'3': >-
  Calling and calling again, she looked well upon that deer and said: “Come,
  come quickly indeed, O noble prince, together with your younger brother!”
'4': >-
  Thus summoned, those tiger-like men—Rama and Lakshmana—called by the princess
  of Videha, looked about that place and then beheld the deer.
'5': >-
  But Lakshmana, suspecting, on seeing it spoke these words: “That very one, I
  deem, is Maricha—the Rakshasa—in the form of a deer.”
'6': >-
  “While kings roam in the great forest, rejoicing in the chase, many have been
  slain by this one, through a sinful stratagem, he being able to assume any
  form at will.”
'7': >-
  “This is the illusion of one who is skilled in magical arts—this form of a
  deer has been fashioned by his maya; it is radiant, O tiger among men,
  resembling a city of the Gandharvas.”
'8': >-
  “A deer such as this—variegated like jewels—does not exist, O Raghava, O lord
  of the world; this is surely an illusion—there is no doubt.”
'9': >-
  While Lakshmana, the son of Kakutstha’s line, spoke thus,
  Sita—pure-smiling—checked him and, delighted yet her mind stolen by the
  disguise, said:
'10': >-
  “O noble prince, that charming deer carries away my heart. Bring it, O
  mighty-armed one; it will be for our sport.”
'11': >-
  “Here, around our hermitage, many creatures of auspicious appearance
  wander—deer as well, and herds of chamara-deer and sṛmara-deer.”
'12': >-
  “Bears, troops of spotted deer, and monkeys, and even kinnaras roam here, O
  mighty-armed one—most excellent in form and very strong.”
'13': >-
  “Yet never before, O king, have I seen another deer like this—so endowed with
  splendor, forbearance, and radiance as this best of deer.”
'14': >-
  “Its limbs are wondrous with many colors; it stands before me like a jewel,
  lighting up the forest without restlessness, shining like the moon.”
'15': >-
  “Ah, its beauty! Ah, its fortune! And the pleasing sweetness of its voice!
  This marvelous deer, with variegated limbs, seems to steal my very heart.”
'16': >-
  “If it comes into your grasp alive, it will be a thing of wonder and will
  arouse astonishment.”
'17': >-
  “When our forest-dwelling is complete and we are established once more in the
  kingdom, this deer will serve for adornment within the inner apartments.”
'18': >-
  “For Bharata, that noble prince, and for my mothers-in-law, and for me as
  well, O lord, this divine deer-form will create amazement.”
'19': >-
  “And if, O tiger among men, that best of deer does not come into your grasp
  alive, then its skin will at least be lovely.”
'20': >-
  “From this creature, when slain, whose hide is as if made of Jambunada-gold, I
  desire to sit and recline upon a grass-mat neatly spread.”
'21': >-
  “This is, I know, a woman’s wayward impulse—fierce and unseemly; yet by this
  creature’s appearance, wonder has been awakened in me.”
'22': >-
  “With its golden hair, its horns like choice gems, its hue like the young sun,
  and its radiance like the path of the stars—”
'23': >-
  “—Raghava’s own mind too was filled with amazement, hearing Sita’s words and
  beholding that wondrous deer.”
'24': >-
  Tempted by its beauty, and urged on by Sita, the delighted Raghava spoke these
  words to his brother Lakshmana:
'25': >-
  “See, Lakshmana, this longing of Vaidehi, risen high! Because of the
  excellence of its form, such a deer will not be found today elsewhere.”
'26': >-
  “Not in the forest-region of Nandana, nor in the resort of Chaitraratha—how
  then upon the earth, O Saumitri, could there be any deer equal to this?”
'27': >-
  “See how the pleasing rows of hair, some lying with and some against the
  grain, look beautiful upon the deer—variegated with golden specks.”
'28': >-
  “See, as it yawns, its tongue—bright like a flame of fire—issuing from its
  mouth, like a mass of a hundred lakes from a cloud.”
'29': >-
  “With a face like masara-stone, and a neck like a wolf’s, and a belly like
  conch and pearls—what man, beholding such a deer, would not have his mind
  enticed?”
'30': >-
  “Seeing this form, radiant as Jambunada-gold, divine, made of many
  jewels—whose mind would not pass into astonishment?”
'31': >-
  “Even for meat, and also for sport, O Lakshmana, kings—archers—slay deer in
  the chase in the great forest.”
'32': >-
  “Wealth is gathered in the great forest by endeavor; and there are also
  diverse minerals, and gems and gold.”
'33': >-
  “That entire essence—men’s wealth that increases one’s store—can all be
  obtained as desired, O Lakshmana, even as in the case of Shukra.”
'34': >-
  “That purpose for which a man, seeking gain, sets forth without
  hesitation—those who know the science of polity call that purpose ‘the sought
  object,’ O well-marked Lakshmana.”
'35': >-
  “On the most precious golden hide of this jewel-like deer, Vaidehi, the
  slender-waisted one, will sit together with me.”
'36': >-
  “Neither a plantain-leaf, nor a dear cloth, nor braided mat, nor woolen cover
  would be like this in touch—so is my thought.”
'37': >-
  “This deer is splendid, and that heavenly deer that moves in the sky is
  splendid too—both are divine: the star-deer and the earth-deer.”
'38': >-
  “If it is as you say, Lakshmana—that this is the maya of a Rakshasa—then its
  slaying must indeed be done by me.”
'39': >-
  “For by this cruel and wicked-minded Maricha, wandering in the forest before,
  foremost sages have been harmed.”
'40': >-
  “And many lords of men, rising up for the chase, have been slain by him—mighty
  archers; therefore this deer is to be killed.”
'41': >-
  “Formerly, here, Vatapi, having insulted ascetics, would kill brahmins after
  they had entered his belly, as one’s own womb destroys a mare’s embryo.”
'42': >-
  “He, once, after a long time, through greed approached the great sage Agastya,
  endowed with splendor—and became his food indeed.”
'43': >-
  “And when Vatapi, on rising again, sought to assume his former form, the
  Blessed one, smiling, spoke to Vatapi thus:”
'44': >-
  “‘Because you have disregarded and insulted the best of twice-born ones by
  your power, O Vatapi, therefore you have come to old age in the world of the
  living.’”
'45': >-
  “So may this Rakshasa not become like Vatapi, O Lakshmana—who would hold
  himself superior to one like me, ever established in dharma and with senses
  subdued.”
'46': >-
  “This one will be slain—let him not escape—like Vatapi by Agastya. Remain
  here, well-armed and restrained, and protect Maithili.”
'47': >-
  “Upon her depends our task, O delight of the Raghu line. I shall slay it—or
  else I shall seize the deer.”
'48': >-
  “Until I go swiftly, O Saumitri, to bring back the deer—see, Lakshmana, how
  Vaidehi’s longing has settled upon the deer’s skin.”
'49': >-
  “This deer will not exist today for its hide alone. You must be vigilant,
  remaining at the hermitage with Sita.”
'50': >-
  “As soon as I strike it down with a single arrow, and having killed it take
  its skin, I shall return quickly, O Lakshmana.”
'51': >-
  “With Jatayu, the exceedingly strong bird, moving about in a circle, and with
  your own intelligence, O Lakshmana—be ever watchful: receive Maithili’s
  protection, and every moment be suspicious on all sides.”
'52': >-
  Thus ends the forty-third canto in the Aranya-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Primeval Epic, entitled “The Resolution of Lakshmana’s Doubt.”
