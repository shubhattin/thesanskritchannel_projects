  Now begins, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa, the ninth
  sarga, entitled “The Origin of Rāvaṇa and Others.”
'1': >-
  Then, after some lapse of time, there was a rākṣasa named Sumālī, who roamed
  everywhere from Rasātala up into the world of mortals.
'2': >-
  Resembling a dark rain-cloud, wearing earrings of heated gold, he took with
  him his daughter, a maiden—like Fortune herself, as it were, without a lotus.
'3': >-
  That rākṣasa lord, while wandering upon the earth at that time, saw the Lord
  of Wealth passing by in the Puṣpaka (aerial car).
'4': >-
  He was going to see his father—the mighty son of Pulastya. Beholding him,
  radiant like an Immortal, moving at will, and resembling the sun in splendor,
'5': >-
  Sumālī, having come up from Rasātala into the human world, reflected with
  astonishment. Thus did that great-minded one among the rākṣasas ponder:
'6': >-
  “What course is beneficial, and how may we prosper?” Then the rākṣasa
  addressed his daughter, named Kaikasī by name:
'7': >-
  “Daughter, now is the time to bestow you in marriage; your youth is passing
  away. And, because suitors fear rejection, you are not being accepted by
  worthy bridegrooms.
'8': >-
  “And on your account all of us, though inclined to righteousness, are
  constrained and held back. For you are endowed with every excellence, dear
  child—like embodied Fortune herself. Truly, to possess a maiden as one’s child
  is a sorrow to all who long for honor.
'9': “And it is not known who would seek the maiden’s hand, O girl.”
'10': >-
  “For you are endowed with every excellence, dear child—like embodied Fortune
  herself. Wherever a maiden is given, there are the mother’s lineage, the
  father’s lineage, and the lineage into which she is bestowed; thus a maiden
  ever stands placing three families in doubt.”
'11': >-
  “Therefore, daughter, seek Viśravas, that best of eminent sages, sprung from
  the line of Prajāpati—Pulastya’s son. Choose him of your own will as your
  husband.”
'12': >-
  “Such sons will be born to you, daughter—of this there is no doubt—equal to
  the Sun in radiance, like this Lord of Wealth.”
'13': >-
  Hearing those words, the maiden, out of reverence for her father, went there
  and stood at the place where Viśravas was performing austerities.
'14': >-
  Just then, O Rāma, the twice-born son of Pulastya was engaged in the Agnihotra
  rite, blazing like a fourth sacred fire.
'15': >-
  Not considering that dreadful hour, yet compelled by reverence for her father,
  she approached before him and stood with face bent down near his feet, the
  lovely woman repeatedly tracing the ground with the tip of her thumb.
'16': >-
  Seeing her—slender-waisted, with a face like the full moon—the most generous
  sage spoke to her, who shone with her own splendor:
'17': >-
  “O auspicious one, whose daughter are you, and from where have you come here?
  What is your purpose, and for whose sake? Tell me the truth, O fair one.”
'18': >-
  Thus addressed, the maiden, with hands joined in reverence, then spoke: “O
  sage, by your own spiritual power you are able to know my intent.
'19': >-
  But know me, O brahmarṣi, to have come by my father’s command. My name is
  Kaikasī; the rest you should know.”
'20': >-
  Then that sage entered into meditation and spoke these words: “O auspicious
  one, I have understood the cause that lies in your heart.
'21': >-
  “You desire sons from me, O you who move like an intoxicated elephant; and it
  is because you have approached me at a dreadful hour.
'22': >-
  “Therefore listen, O auspicious one, to what kind of sons you will
  beget—dreadful, of dreadful form, and fond of a dreadful lineage.
'23': >-
  “You will bring forth rākṣasas, O slender-waisted one, of cruel deeds.”
  Hearing his words, she bowed down and spoke:
'24': >-
  “Revered sir, O knower of Brahman, I do not desire such sons from you—of
  utterly wicked conduct. Be pleased to show me favor.”
'25': >-
  Thus spoken to by the maiden, Viśravas, foremost of sages, again addressed
  Kaikasī, whose face was fair as the full moon with Rohiṇī:
'26': >-
  “The youngest son that will be born to you, O fair-faced one, will be in
  accordance with my lineage, and he will be righteous-souled.”
'27': >-
  Thus addressed, the maiden, O Rāma, after some time, gave birth to a loathsome
  being—of rākṣasa form, exceedingly dreadful.
'28': >-
  (He was) Daśagrīva (Ten-necked), with great fangs, like a mass of dark
  collyrium; with coppery lips, twenty arms, a huge mouth, and blazing hair.
'29': >-
  At the time of his birth, jackals with flaming mouths (appeared), and
  flesh-eating creatures moved about, and inauspicious circles began to revolve
  to the left.
'30': >-
  The god (of the sky) rained blood; the clouds roared with harsh sounds; the
  sun did not shine forth, and great meteors fell upon the earth.
'31': >-
  The earth trembled, and dreadful winds blew; and the ocean, lord of rivers,
  though unagitated by nature, was churned and heaved.
'32': >-
  Then his father, equal to Brahmā in dignity, performed the name-giving for
  him: “This one is born as Daśagrīva; Daśagrīva shall he be.”
'33': >-
  After him was born Kumbhakarṇa, of great strength—so vast in size that no
  measure for his measure is found here.
'34': >-
  Then there was born a daughter named Śūrpaṇakhā, with a distorted face; and
  Vibhīṣaṇa, righteous-souled—the youngest son of Kaikasī.
'35': At the birth of that great-souled one (Vibhīṣaṇa), a shower of flowers fell.
'36': >-
  In the sky, drums of the gods resounded then, bestowing delight; and in the
  mid-air at that time there were voices saying, “Well done! Well done!”
'37': >-
  Those two mighty and highly energetic ones—Kumbhakarṇa and Daśagrīva—grew up
  there in that great forest, then becoming causes of fear to the world.
'38': >-
  Kumbhakarṇa, reckless, ranged about ever unsated, devouring the three worlds
  and even great sages devoted to righteousness.
'39': >-
  But Vibhīṣaṇa, righteous-souled, ever established in dharma, lived with study
  of the Veda and regulated diet, having conquered his senses.
'40': >-
  Then, after some time, the god Vaiśravaṇa—the Lord of Wealth—came there in the
  Puṣpaka to see his father.
'41': >-
  Seeing him there, blazing as it were with splendor, the rākṣasī Kaikasī
  approached and spoke to Daśagrīva:
'42': >-
  “Son, behold your brother Vaiśravaṇa, encompassed with radiance. Though you
  are his equal in brotherhood, see yourself not to be like him.”
'43': >-
  “Therefore, Daśagrīva, O one of immeasurable prowess, strive in such a way
  that you, my son, may become like Vaiśravaṇa.”
'44': >-
  Hearing his mother’s words, the glorious Daśagrīva was seized by boundless
  resentment, and then he made a vow.
'45': >-
  “Truly I promise you: I shall become equal to my brother, or even superior, in
  might; cast away the burning anguish seated in your heart.”
'46': >-
  Then, with that very wrath, Daśagrīva along with his younger brothers,
  intending to accomplish a difficult deed, fixed his mind on austerity.
'47': >-
  Resolving, “By austerity I shall attain my desire,” he went, for the sake of
  achieving his own purpose, to the auspicious hermitage at Gokarṇa.
'48': >-
  That rākṣasa, together with his brothers, performed there incomparable
  austerities, of terrible prowess; he satisfied also the mighty Grandfather
  (Brahmā), who, being pleased, granted boons that brought victory.
'49': >-
  Thus ends the ninth sarga, entitled “The Origin of Rāvaṇa and Others,” in the
  Uttara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the ancient epic, composed by
  Vālmīki.
