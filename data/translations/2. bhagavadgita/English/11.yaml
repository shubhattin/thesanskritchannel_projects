'0': Om—salutations to the Supreme Self (the परमात्मा).
'1': Now begins the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā.
'2': >-
  Now, the Eleventh Chapter: The Yoga of the Vision of the Universal Form
  (Viśvarūpa-darśana-yoga).
'3': 'Arjuna said:'
'4': >-
  Out of compassion for me, you have spoken that supreme, most secret teaching
  called knowledge of the Self. By that word of yours, this delusion of mine has
  been dispelled.
'5': >-
  I have heard from you in detail the arising and dissolution of beings; and
  also your imperishable greatness, O lotus-eyed Lord.
'6': >-
  Even so, just as you have declared yourself, O Supreme Lord, I desire to
  behold your sovereign (divine) form, O Puruṣottama (Supreme Person).
'7': >-
  If you think, O Lord, that it is possible for me to see it, then, O Lord of
  Yoga, reveal to me your imperishable Self.
'8': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'9': >-
  Behold, O Pārtha, my forms—by the hundreds and by the thousands—of many kinds:
  divine, of manifold colors and shapes.
'10': >-
  Behold the Ādityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the two Aśvins, and the Maruts.
  Behold, O Bhārata, many wonders never seen before.
'11': >-
  Behold today, O Guḍākeśa, the entire universe—moving and unmoving—unified here
  in my body; and also whatever else you wish to see.
'12': >-
  But you cannot see me with these ordinary eyes of yours. Therefore I grant you
  divine sight; behold my sovereign Yoga (my divine power).
'13': 'Sañjaya said:'
'14': >-
  Having spoken thus, O King, Hari, the great Lord of Yoga, revealed to Pārtha
  his supreme, sovereign form.
'15': >-
  It had many mouths and many eyes, and many wondrous visions; it bore many
  divine ornaments, and held many divine weapons uplifted.
'16': >-
  It wore divine garlands and garments, and was anointed with divine fragrances;
  it was altogether marvelous, the Deity infinite, with faces on all sides.
'17': >-
  If the radiance of a thousand suns were to rise at once in the sky, that might
  resemble the splendor of that Great Soul.
'18': >-
  There, in the body of the God of gods, the son of Pāṇḍu then beheld the entire
  universe, established in one place, though divided into many forms.
'19': >-
  Then Dhanañjaya, filled with amazement, his hair standing on end, bowed his
  head to the Lord, and with joined palms he spoke.
'20': 'Arjuna said:'
'21': >-
  O God, I behold in your body all the gods, and likewise hosts of diverse
  beings; Brahmā, the Lord, seated upon the lotus; all the sages; and the divine
  serpents.
'22': >-
  I behold you on every side as infinite in form—having many arms, bellies,
  mouths, and eyes. I see neither your end, nor your middle, nor again your
  beginning, O Lord of the universe, O Universal Form.
'23': >-
  I behold you crowned, bearing a mace and a discus—an ocean of radiance,
  blazing everywhere. I behold you, difficult to gaze upon from all sides,
  immeasurable, like the splendor of a blazing fire and the sun.
'24': >-
  You are the Imperishable, the supreme One to be known. You are the ultimate
  refuge and treasure-house of this universe. You are imperishable, the guardian
  of eternal dharma. You are the eternal Person—so do I deem you.
'25': >-
  I behold you as beginningless, middleless, endless; of infinite power; with
  countless arms; with the sun and the moon as your eyes; with your mouth as
  blazing fire—heating this whole universe with your own radiance.
'26': >-
  For this space between heaven and earth is pervaded by you alone, and all the
  directions as well. Beholding this wondrous and terrible form of yours, O
  Great Soul, the three worlds are stricken with fear.
'27': >-
  Indeed, these hosts of gods enter into you; some, terrified, praise you with
  joined palms. Bands of great seers and perfected ones, crying “May there be
  welfare,” extol you with abundant hymns.
'28': >-
  The Rudras, the Ādityas, the Vasus, and the Sādhyas; the Viśvedevas, the two
  Aśvins, the Maruts, and the Uṣmapas; hosts of Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Asuras, and
  Siddhas—all gaze upon you, utterly amazed.
'29': >-
  Seeing your vast form with many mouths and eyes, O mighty-armed One; with many
  arms, thighs, and feet; with many bellies; with many terrible tusks—these
  worlds tremble, and so do I.
'30': >-
  Seeing you touching the sky, blazing, of many colors; with gaping mouths and
  large, shining eyes—my inmost self trembles; I find neither steadiness nor
  peace, O Viṣṇu.
'31': >-
  Having seen your mouths, dreadful with tusks, resembling the fire of time
  (all-destroying death), I know not the quarters; I find no shelter. Be
  gracious, O Lord of gods, O abode of the universe.
'32': >-
  And these sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, all together with hosts of kings of the earth;
  Bhīṣma, Droṇa, and that son of a charioteer (Karṇa); along with the foremost
  warriors on our side also—
'33': >-
  All, hurrying, enter into your mouths, dreadful with terrible tusks. Some are
  seen stuck between your teeth, their heads crushed to powder.
'34': >-
  As the many torrents of rivers flow swiftly toward the ocean alone, so too
  these heroes of the human world enter your mouths, blazing on every side.
'35': >-
  As moths with great speed rush into a blazing fire for their own destruction,
  so too these worlds rush, with great speed, into your mouths for destruction.
'36': >-
  You lick up, devouring on all sides, the entire worlds with your flaming
  mouths. Filling the whole universe with splendor, your terrible rays scorch, O
  Viṣṇu.
'37': >-
  Tell me: who are you, of this fierce form? Salutations be to you, O best of
  gods—be gracious. I desire to know you, the primal One; for I do not
  understand your purpose and activity.
'38': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'39': >-
  I am Time (Kāla), grown mighty, the destroyer of worlds, engaged here in
  bringing all peoples to dissolution. Even without you, none of these warriors
  arrayed in the opposing armies shall survive.
'40': >-
  Therefore arise and attain glory. Conquer your enemies and enjoy a flourishing
  kingdom. By me they have been slain already; be merely an instrument, O
  Savyasācin (ambidextrous archer).
'41': >-
  Droṇa, Bhīṣma, Jayadratha, Karṇa, and also the other heroic warriors—these
  have been slain by me; do you slay them. Do not be distressed. Fight—you shall
  conquer your rivals in battle.
'42': 'Sañjaya said:'
'43': >-
  Hearing this word of Keśava, the crowned Arjuna, with joined palms and
  trembling, bowed down; and again, speaking to Kṛṣṇa with a choked, faltering
  voice, he prostrated himself in fear.
'44': 'Arjuna said:'
'45': >-
  It is fitting, O Hṛṣīkeśa, that at your praise the world rejoices and becomes
  devoted. Terrified, the Rākṣasas flee in all directions, and all the hosts of
  Siddhas bow down to you.
'46': >-
  And why should they not bow to you, O Great Soul? You are greater even than
  Brahmā, the primal creator. O Infinite One, O Lord of gods, O abode of the
  universe—you are the Imperishable, the being and the non-being, and that which
  is beyond both.
'47': >-
  You are the primal God, the ancient Person; you are the supreme refuge of this
  universe. You are the knower, and the knowable, and the supreme abode. By you
  this universe is pervaded, O you of infinite forms.
'48': >-
  You are Vāyu, Yama, Agni, Varuṇa, the moon; you are Prajāpati, and the
  great-grandfather (Brahmā) as well. Salutations, salutations to you a thousand
  times—and again and yet again, salutations, salutations to you.
'49': >-
  Salutations to you from the front, and from behind; salutations to you from
  every side, O All. Infinite in valor, immeasurable in might, you pervade all;
  therefore you are all.
'50': >-
  Whatever I have said rashly, thinking, “He is my friend,” addressing you as “O
  Kṛṣṇa,” “O Yādava,” “O friend”—not knowing this greatness of yours—through
  heedlessness or even out of affection,
'51': >-
  and whatever disrespect has been shown by me in jest, in play, while lying
  down, sitting, or eating—whether alone with you, O Acyuta, or in the presence
  of others—of you, the immeasurable One, I seek forgiveness.
'52': >-
  You are the father of this world, of the moving and the unmoving. You are to
  be worshipped, and you are the most venerable teacher. None is equal to
  you—how then could there be any greater than you—even in the three worlds, O
  you of incomparable power?
'53': >-
  Therefore, bowing down and prostrating my body, I seek to please you, the
  Lord, worthy of praise. As a father to a son, as a friend to a friend, as a
  beloved to the beloved—so should you bear with me, O God.
'54': >-
  Having beheld what was never seen before, I rejoice; yet my mind is distressed
  with fear. Show me, O God, that very (gentle) form. Be gracious, O Lord of
  gods, O abode of the universe.
'55': >-
  I wish to see you as before—crowned, bearing the mace, with the discus in
  hand—in that same four-armed form. Become that, O thousand-armed One, O
  Universal Form.
'56': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'57': >-
  Out of grace, O Arjuna, this supreme form has been shown to you by me through
  my own Yoga: radiant, universal, infinite, primal—such as has never before
  been seen by anyone other than you.
'58': >-
  Not by the Vedas, nor by sacrifices, nor by study, nor by gifts, nor by
  rituals, nor by severe austerities can I, in this form, be seen in the world
  of men by anyone other than you, O foremost of the Kurus.
'59': >-
  Let there be no fear in you, nor bewilderment, on seeing this terrible form of
  mine. Freed from fear and with a gladdened heart, behold again this very form
  of mine.
'60': 'Sañjaya said:'
'61': >-
  Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Vāsudeva revealed once more his own (familiar)
  form; and the great-souled One consoled the frightened Arjuna, becoming again
  of gentle appearance.
'62': 'Arjuna said:'
'63': >-
  Seeing this gentle human form of yours, O Janārdana, I am now composed,
  restored to awareness, and returned to my natural state.
'64': 'The Blessed Lord said:'
'65': >-
  Very difficult to behold is this form of mine which you have seen. Even the
  gods ever long to behold this form.
'66': >-
  Not by the Vedas, nor by austerity, nor by gift, nor by sacrifice can I be
  seen in this manner, as you have seen me.
'67': >-
  But by single-minded devotion (ananyā-bhakti) I can thus be known in truth,
  and also seen, and also entered into, O Arjuna, O scorcher of foes.
'68': >-
  He who does my work, who holds me as the Supreme goal, who is devoted to me,
  who is free from attachment, and who is without enmity toward all beings—he
  comes to me, O Pāṇḍava.
'69': >-
  Om Tat Sat. Thus in the Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, among the Upaniṣads, in the
  knowledge of Brahman, in the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue between Śrī
  Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, ends the Eleventh Chapter, entitled “The Yoga of the Vision
  of the Universal Form.”
