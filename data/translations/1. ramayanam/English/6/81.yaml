  Now begins the eighty-first canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Slaying of the Illusory Sītā.”
'1': >-
  Having understood the mind of the great-souled Rāghava (Rāma), he withdrew
  from that battle and entered that city.
'2': >-
  Then, recalling the slaughter of those mighty and impetuous rākṣasas, the
  heroic son of Rāvaṇa (Indrajit), his eyes reddened with wrath, sallied forth.
'3': >-
  He went out by the western gate, surrounded by rākṣasas—Indrajit, endowed with
  exceedingly great prowess, the descendant of Pulastya, a thorn to the gods.
'4': >-
  And Indrajit, seeing the two brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, those heroes ready
  and eager for battle, then manifested his illusion (māyā).
'5': >-
  Placing upon his chariot at that time a Sītā who was made of illusion, and
  surrounding himself with a great force, he resolved upon her slaughter.
'6': >-
  That evil-minded one, deluding the understanding of all in order to bewilder
  them, determined to kill Sītā and went forth facing the vānaras.
'7': >-
  Seeing him come out, all those dwellers of the forest (the vānaras) sprang up
  in great anger, stones in hand, eager to fight.
'8': >-
  Hanumān, the foremost of the monkeys, went at their head, seizing a very large
  peak of a mountain, difficult of access.
'9': >-
  He beheld Sītā on Indrajit’s chariot, bereft of joy—wearing a single braid,
  wretched, her face emaciated by fasting.
'10': >-
  Wearing but one garment, unkempt, beloved of Rāghava, that best of women—her
  whole body smeared with dust and grime.
'11': >-
  Gazing at that Maithilī for a moment and pondering, he was struck with wonder,
  for the daughter of Janaka had not been seen by him for a long time.
'12': >-
  Seeing her—sorrow-stricken, joyless, a woman of austerities—wretched upon the
  chariot, in the power of the son of the lord of rākṣasas, he addressed her.
'13': >-
  Thinking, “What is intended by him with this?” that great monkey, together
  with the foremost of the vānaras, rushed at Rāvaṇa’s son.
'14': >-
  Seeing that vānara host, Rāvaṇa’s son, overwhelmed by fury, drew his sword
  and, grasping Sītā by the hair on her head, dragged her.
'15': >-
  Before their very eyes, that rākṣasa struck the woman, who cried out, “Rāma!
  Rāma!”—she who had been yoked to the chariot by illusion.
'16': >-
  Seeing her hair seized, Hanumān fell into anguish, the son of the Wind-god
  letting fall tears born of grief from his eyes.
'17': >-
  Seeing her, lovely-limbed in every part—Rāma’s beloved queen—he spoke harsh
  words in anger to the son of the king of rākṣasas.
'18': >-
  “O wicked-souled one, you grasp her hair only for your own destruction! Though
  born in the line of Brahmarṣis, you have taken refuge in a rākṣasa womb.”
'19': >-
  “Fie upon you, of sinful conduct, whose mind is such! O cruel one, ignoble, of
  evil behavior—base wretch, of sinful prowess! Such a deed is of the ignoble;
  you have no shame, O pitiless one!”
'20': >-
  “The Maithilī has been torn away from her home, from her kingdom, and from the
  hands of Rāma—what has she done against you that you would slay her, O
  merciless one?”
'21': >-
  “Having slain Sītā, you will not live long in any wise. By that act which
  deserves death, you have indeed come into my hands!”
'22': >-
  “And those worlds appointed for slayers of women—reviled and condemned by all
  people—having cast off life here, after death you shall surely attain them.”
'23': >-
  Thus speaking, Hanumān, surrounded by armed vānaras, charged in great wrath
  against the son of the lord of rākṣasas.
'24': >-
  When that vānara army, of great prowess, came rushing on, he checked it with
  the army of rākṣasas of dreadful wrath.
'25': >-
  Shaking and harassing the vānara host with a thousand arrows, Indrajit then
  addressed Hanumān, the best of the monkeys.
'26': >-
  “Sugrīva and you and Rāma—on account of what have you come here? This very
  day, before your eyes, I shall slay Vaidehī!”
'27': >-
  “Having killed her, then I shall slay Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and you, O vānara; and I
  shall slay Sugrīva, and that ignoble Vibhīṣaṇa as well.”
'28': >-
  “You say, ‘Women should not be slain,’ O leaping one; but what causes
  affliction to enemies—and what must indeed be done—that I shall do.”
'29': >-
  Having spoken thus, and as that illusory Sītā wept, Indrajit himself struck
  her with his sword, sharp-edged and keen.
'30': >-
  Severed by him along the line of the sacred thread, that austere
  woman—broad-hipped, lovely to behold—fell upon the earth.
'31': >-
  Having slain that woman, Indrajit said to Hanumān: “See here, by me, Rāma’s
  beloved has been slain by a weapon! Vaidehī is killed; your toil is
  fruitless!”
'32': >-
  Then, having himself killed her with that mighty sword,
  Indrajit—delighted—mounted his chariot and roared with a great sound.
'33': >-
  The vānaras, stationed not far away, heard the cry of that roaring one, his
  mouth wide open, as he had taken refuge in that fortress.
'34': >-
  Thus, after slaying Sītā, that evil-minded Rāvaṇa’s son became exultant at
  heart. Seeing him in that delighted guise, the vānaras ran toward him, their
  faces downcast with grief.
'35': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-first canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “The Slaying of the Illusory Sītā.”
