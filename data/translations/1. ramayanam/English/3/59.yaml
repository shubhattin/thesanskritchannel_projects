  Now begins the fifty-ninth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Censure of Lakṣmaṇa’s Coming (away from Sītā).”
'1': >-
  Then Rāma, the delighter of the Raghu race, having returned from the hermitage
  and finding Lakṣmaṇa there (without Sītā), questioned Saumitri between (hope
  and fear), and in grief spoke these words:
'2': >-
  He said to him: “For what reason hast thou come, leaving Maithilī behind—she
  whom, trusting in thee, I left apart in the forest?”
'3': >-
  “Seeing thee come back to me—having abandoned Maithilī, O Lakṣmaṇa—my mind is
  stricken with anguish, suspecting a great evil; and that suspicion, alas,
  seems true.”
'4': >-
  “My left eye throbs; my arm, and my heart too, tremble, O Lakṣmaṇa, on seeing
  thee far away upon the path—without Sītā.”
'5': >-
  Thus addressed, Saumitri Lakṣmaṇa, of auspicious marks, once more overwhelmed
  by sorrow, spoke to Rāma who was sunk in distress:
'6': >-
  “Not of mine own will, out of self-chosen desire, have I come here after
  leaving her. Constrained by her herself, by stern and urgent words, have I
  come into thy presence.”
'7': >-
  “‘O Lakṣmaṇa!’—so rang out a cry, as though uttered by a noble one, in a clear
  and most resonant voice; and the words, ‘Save me!’—that utterance of
  Maithilī’s came to my hearing.”
'8': >-
  “Hearing that cry of distress, Maithilī—through her affection for thee—weeping
  and shaken with fear, quickly said to me, ‘Go, go!’”
'9': >-
  “Though I urged her again and again with ‘Go!’ she addressed Maithilī with
  these words—words accompanied by conviction (as of certainty):”
'10': >-
  “‘I behold not any rākṣasa here that could bring fear upon him (Rāma). Be at
  ease; be serene. This has been uttered by someone for some reason—(but there
  is no cause).’”
'11': >-
  “‘How would a noble person utter a reproachful and base cry—“Save me!”—to
  Sītā, when he who would save her is one that could rescue even the Thirty
  Gods?’”
'12': >-
  “‘For what cause, and by whom, could there be spoken—catching hold of my
  brother’s voice—those discordant words: “O Lakṣmaṇa, save me!”?’”
'13': >-
  “‘That is a speech sent forth by a rākṣasa; out of terror it cries “Save me!”,
  O fair one. Thou shouldst not make thyself anxious—thou who art attended by
  maidens and women.’”
'14': >-
  “‘Enough of agitation—go not forth in bewilderment. Abide in thyself, be
  composed, free from anxiety. There is no man in the three worlds who in
  battle—’”
'15': >-
  “‘—whether already born or yet to be born—could vanquish Rāghava in combat.
  Unconquerable is Rāghava in war, even by the gods with Indra at their head.’”
'16': >-
  Thus addressed, Vaidehī, her mind bewildered, spoke to me harshly these
  dreadful words, letting fall tears:
'17': >-
  “‘Thy feeling toward me is indeed exceedingly sinful and fixed within thee.
  With my brother lost, thou shalt not attain me (as thy desire).’”
'18': >-
  “‘At the sign of Bharata thou dost follow after Rāma; though he cries out
  exceedingly, thou dost not go to him (to aid him).’”
'19': >-
  “‘A foe, moving in secret, dost thou accompany him for my sake, seeking an
  opening (a vulnerable moment) in Rāghava; therefore thou goest not to him.’”
'20': >-
  Thus spoken to by Vaidehī, Lakṣmaṇa—enraged, with eyes reddened, lips
  quivering from wrath—went forth from the hermitage.
'21': >-
  While Saumitri was thus speaking, Rāma, bewildered by grief and burning
  distress, said: “An evil deed, O gentle one, is this—that thou hast come here
  leaving her behind.”
'22': >-
  “Though knowing me to be able to ward off the rākṣasas, thou hast, because of
  these angry words of Maithilī, departed (from her) and come away.”
'23': >-
  “I am not in any wise pleased with thee, in that thou hast left Maithilī and
  come hither, having heard harsh speech from a woman in wrath.”
'24': >-
  “In every way thou hast been driven from thy proper course by Sītā’s urging:
  coming under the power of anger, thou didst not carry out my command.”
'25': >-
  “For that rākṣasa lies there, struck down by me with an arrow—he who, assuming
  the form of a deer, lured me away from the hermitage.”
'26': >-
  “Drawing the bow and fitting on the shaft, I smote him with a
  sportive-feathered arrow; and, casting off that deer-form, with voice made
  feeble, that rākṣasa—wearer of armlets—became manifest.”
'27': >-
  “And by the very cry of that one, wounded by the arrow, in anguish—taking hold
  of my voice, audible from far away—were uttered those most dreadful words; and
  it was because of them that thou camest, abandoning Maithilī.”
'28': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-ninth canto of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa in the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Censure of Lakṣmaṇa’s Coming
  (away from Sītā).”
