  Now begins the sixty-first canto of the Ayodhya Kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Kauśalyā’s Reproach.”
'1': >-
  When Rāma—devoted to righteousness—had departed to the forest, Kauśalyā,
  afflicted and weeping for herself, spoke these words to her husband:
'2': >-
  “Though your fame is proclaimed in the three worlds—(that you are)
  compassionate, generous, gentle of speech, and one who speaks what is
  pleasing, O Rāghava’s sire—
'3': >-
  how indeed will those two sons—best of men—together with Sītā, reared in
  comfort and now plunged in sorrow, endure suffering in the forest?”
'4': >-
  “She is surely youthful, dark-hued, tender-limbed, delicate, and fit only for
  ease—how will Maithilī forcibly bear both heat and cold?”
'5': >-
  “Having eaten noble food with soups and condiments, that large-eyed lady—how
  will Sītā partake of forest fare, of roots and fruits for her sustenance?”
'6': >-
  “Having listened to auspicious songs and the sound of musical instruments, the
  blameless one—how will she hear the inauspicious roar of flesh-eating lions?”
'7': >-
  “Where now does that mighty-armed, great and powerful Rāma—like a lofty
  Indra-banner—lie down, placing as his pillow an arm like an iron bar?”
'8': >-
  “When shall I behold again Rāma’s excellent face—lotus-hued, framed with
  beautiful hair, with lotus-like breath, and eyes like a full-blown lotus?”
'9': >-
  “My heart must surely be made of adamant—there is no doubt—for though I do not
  see him, it does not burst into a thousand pieces.”
'10': >-
  “By your cruel deed, casting away my kinsmen, you have driven them forth to
  wander—those worthy of happiness, now wretched in the forest.”
'11': >-
  “If, at the end of fifteen years, Rāghava returns, will Bharata not relinquish
  the kingdom and the treasury?”
'12': >-
  “Some, it is said, feed their own relatives at a śrāddha; and only afterward
  do they look upon the best of Brahmins, as though their purpose were
  fulfilled.”
'13': >-
  “There, those twice-born who are virtuous and learned—though like the gods and
  worthy even of nectar—are not honored afterward.”
'14': >-
  “Even when the Brahmins are satisfied, those wise ‘best of twice-born’ are not
  deemed fit to eat afterward—like bulls that are treated as though their horns
  were cut (and thus made worthless).”
'15': >-
  “Even so, O lord of the people: when the younger brother has enjoyed the
  kingdom, why should the elder and the best of brothers not feel contempt?”
'16': >-
  “A tiger does not wish to eat food brought by another; likewise the tiger
  among men (Rāma) will not desire what has been licked by another.”
'17': >-
  “Clarified butter as oblation, sacrificial cakes, kuśa-grass, and the
  yūpa-posts of khadira wood—these, once used up, are not employed again in a
  sacrifice.”
'18': >-
  “So too is this kingdom seized—like liquor robbed of its essence; Rāma is not
  fit to relish it, like a sacrifice in which the soma has perished.”
'19': >-
  “Rāghava will not endure such dishonor—any more than a powerful tiger would
  endure the pulling of its tail by a child.”
'20': >-
  “No worlds would fear him in a great battle; and yet, being righteous of soul,
  he would here restrain unrighteousness and set the world upon the path of
  dharma by dharma itself.”
'21': >-
  “Indeed, that mighty-armed great hero, with golden arrows, could burn up even
  the oceans—like the end of an age consuming all beings.”
'22': >-
  “Such a one—lion-strong, bull-eyed, the bull among men—has been slain by his
  father himself, like a son (brought forth) from the water being destroyed by
  that very water.”
'23': >-
  “The dharma practiced by the twice-born, sanctioned by the scriptures and
  eternal—if you are devoted to dharma, then why have you exiled your son?”
'24': >-
  “A woman’s sole refuge is her husband; her second refuge is her son; her third
  refuge is her kinsmen, O king—there is no fourth in this world.”
'25': >-
  “And there, you are not for me; Rāma has taken refuge in the forest. I do not
  wish to go to the forest at all—for in every way I have been slain by you.”
'26': >-
  “This kingdom with its realm has been slain by you; and you yourself, along
  with your ministers, are as good as slain. I, with my sons, am slain—and the
  citizens too are slain—while your son and your wife rejoice.”
'27': >-
  Hearing this speech of hers, harsh and filled with dreadful words, the king
  too, grief-stricken, fell into bewilderment. Then that ruler entered into
  sorrow, and at that very time remembered again his own evil deed.
'28': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-first canto of the Ayodhya Kāṇḍa in the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the first epic, entitled “Kauśalyā’s Reproach.”
