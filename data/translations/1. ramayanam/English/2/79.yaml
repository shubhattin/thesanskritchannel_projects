  Now, in the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  seventy-ninth sarga, named “The Refusal of the Ministers’ Entreaty.”

  Then, at daybreak, on the fourteenth day, the makers of royal policy—the
  counsellors—assembled and addressed Bharata with these words:
'2': >-
  “Daśaratha has departed to heaven—he who was our weightiest elder and
  venerable preceptor. And Rāma, the eldest, has been sent into exile, along
  with mighty-armed Lakṣmaṇa.
'3': >-
  “Today, O highly renowned prince, you are our king, so that, coming together
  under your rule, this kingdom may not fall into fault through being without a
  leader.
'4': >-
  “All the consecration-materials are here, O Rāghava. Your own people, and the
  guilds and companies as well, await you, O son of the king.
'5': >-
  “Accept, O Bharata, this great kingdom—your father’s and your forefathers’
  inheritance. Consecrate yourself, and protect us, O bull among men.”
'6': >-
  Having had all the articles for consecration arranged and made ready in every
  way, Bharata—steadfast in his vows—replied to all those people:
'7': >-
  “The sovereignty of the eldest is ever fitting for our lineage. You, good and
  wise men, ought not to speak to me in this manner.
'8': >-
  “For our elder brother Rāma is indeed the one who shall be lord of the earth.
  As for me, I shall dwell in the forest for nine years and five.
'9': >-
  “Let the great army be yoked—four-limbed (with chariots, elephants, cavalry,
  and infantry) and mighty. I shall bring back my eldest brother Rāghava from
  the forest.
'10': >-
  “And with all this equipment for consecration prepared, setting it in the
  forefront, I shall go toward the forest for Rāma’s sake.
'11': >-
  “There, having consecrated that tiger among men and placed him foremost, I
  shall bring Rāma back—like one bringing the oblation-bearing fire from a
  sacrifice.
'12': >-
  “I shall not fulfil this my own desire, steeped in attachment to my mother. I
  shall dwell in the hard-to-reach forest; Rāma shall be king.”
'13': >-
  “Let roads be made by the artisans—both level and uneven; and let guards also
  proceed along the route, examining the difficult stretches of the way.”
'14': >-
  As he—the prince—thus spoke for Rāma’s sake, all the people replied to him
  with an excellent and auspicious utterance:
'15': >-
  “As you speak thus, may lotus-born Fortune (Śrī) attend upon you—since you, O
  prince, desire to give the earth to the eldest son of the king.”
'16': >-
  Hearing that unsurpassed speech spoken by the king’s son, tears born of
  joy—arising from the eyes upon their noble faces—fell down before him.
'17': >-
  Hearing these words, those ministers and the members of the assembly, now free
  from grief and filled with delight, spoke; and the devoted people, as well as
  the guild of artisans, were directed—according to your command—to prepare the
  road.
'18': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-ninth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, named “The Refusal of the Ministers’
  Entreaty.”
