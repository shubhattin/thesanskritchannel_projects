  Now begins the fifty-third canto of Sundara Kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Cooling of the Fire.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words of his brother, the ten-necked Rāvaṇa, replying to the
  great-souled one, spoke in return a statement that was suited to the place and
  time and conducive to his own purpose.
'2': >-
  “Indeed, what you have spoken is proper: the slaying of an envoy is censured.
  Yet his restraint must surely be brought about in some other manner, such that
  he comes to be punished.”
'3': >-
  “The tail, they say, is dear to monkeys and is regarded by them as an
  ornament. Therefore let his tail be set alight quickly, and let him go forth
  bearing that burning brand.”
'4': >-
  “Then let all his kinsmen and relations—together with his friends—behold him
  wretched, afflicted by the disfigurement of his limbs and the deformity of his
  body.”
'5': >-
  Thereupon the lord of the rākṣasas issued an order that he be led through the
  entire city, along with its squares and crossings, by rākṣasas, with his tail
  made to blaze.
'6': >-
  Hearing that command of his, the rākṣasas—harsh through anger—wrapped his tail
  with worn-out cloth of cotton.
'7': >-
  Even as his tail was being wrapped, the great monkey’s tail seemed to grow
  ever larger—like fire in the forests that, finding dry fuel, increases
  mightily.
'8': >-
  Then, after sprinkling it with oil, they kindled fire thereupon; but with his
  tail aflame, he struck and battered those rākṣasas with it.
'9': >-
  His spirit filled with wrath and indignation, his face like the rising sun,
  that foremost of monkeys was again surrounded by assembled, cruel rākṣasas.
'10': >-
  Men and women, children and the aged—night-rangers all—took delight (in the
  spectacle). Bound fast, the hero then formed a resolve suited to that very
  moment.
'11': >-
  “Truly, these rākṣasas are not able to do anything to me, even though I am
  bound. Having snapped these bonds, I could spring up and slay them all again.”
'12': >-
  “Yet if these evil-souled ones bind me while I roam under my lord’s command,
  for the welfare of my lord, then no fault of mine is thereby committed, nor is
  my mission undone.”
'13': >-
  “In battle I am more than a match for all the rākṣasas; but for the sake of
  pleasing Rāma, I shall endure this as it is.”
'14': >-
  “Moreover, I must scout Laṅkā once again; for by night it was not well seen by
  me, owing to the arrangements and works of the fortifications.”
'15': >-
  “I must certainly behold Laṅkā at the close of night. Let them, if they wish,
  bind me again, and let them ignite my tail as well.”
'16': >-
  While the rākṣasas inflicted torment, there was no weariness in his mind. Then
  those rākṣasas took hold of the great monkey—compact of form and full of
  strength—
'17': >-
  and, rejoicing, they led along that elephant among monkeys, proclaiming their
  deed with the blare of conches and the sounding of kettledrums.
'18': >-
  Those cruel-doing rākṣasas paraded him through that city. Followed by the
  rākṣasas, the destroyer of foes went on as though at ease.
'19': >-
  Thus Hanumān surveyed the great city of the rākṣasas. Then the great monkey
  beheld aerial chariots, wondrous and diverse.
'20': >-
  He saw the ground-spaces made close and well ordered, and the squares
  distinctly laid out; he saw streets crowded with houses, and also the many
  junctions and crossings.
'21': >-
  He saw main roads and by-roads, and likewise the interiors between houses; and
  he observed the four-way squares, and the royal highway as well.
'22': >-
  All the rākṣasas kept proclaiming, “A spy! A spy!” Women, children, and the
  aged came out here and there out of curiosity.
'23': >-
  Desiring to behold Hanumān with his tail set ablaze, they gathered; and as the
  tip of Hanumān’s tail burned brightly, then—
'24': >-
  those rākṣasī women with misshapen eyes reported to the Lady Sītā that
  grievous news: “The tawny-faced monkey with whom you spoke—”
'25': >-
  “—he is being led about now with his tail kindled.” Hearing that cruel speech,
  like the snatching away of her very life, Vaidehī—afflicted by sorrow—drew
  near to the Fire-god.
'26': >-
  Facing what is auspicious, she became well disposed toward that great monkey.
  The large-eyed lady reverently attended upon Havyavāhana (the bearer of
  oblations),
'27': >-
  and prayed: “If there is in me faithful service to my husband; if there is in
  me the practice of austerity; if there is in me the vow of one husband—then be
  cool to Hanumān.”
'28': >-
  “If there is any compassion in that wise one toward me; or if any residue of
  good fortune yet remains to me—then be cool to Hanumān.”
'29': >-
  “If that righteous-souled one truly knows me to be of good conduct and longing
  for reunion with him—then be cool to Hanumān.”
'30': >-
  “If noble Sugrīva, true in battle, will deliver me from this barrier of waters
  of sorrow—then be cool to Hanumān.”
'31': >-
  Thereupon the fire—its flame sharp, restless, and turning to the right in
  auspicious circling—blazed forth, as though announcing good fortune for the
  monkey to the doe-eyed lady.
'32': >-
  And the wind, bearing the fire upon Hanumān’s tail, blew wholesome for the
  Lady, cool as a snowy breeze.
'33': >-
  As his tail was burning, the monkey reflected: “Why is this kindled fire not
  burning me on every side?”
'34': >-
  “A great flame is plainly seen, yet it causes me no pain—remaining at the tip
  of my tail like the touch of coolness itself.”
'35': >-
  “Or else this is clearly due to what I, while leaping, have already witnessed:
  the marvel born of Rāma’s power in the lord of rivers, the ocean, and in Mount
  Maināka.”
'36': >-
  “If, for Rāma’s sake, such eager helpfulness arose in the ocean and in wise
  Maināka, what will not fire itself do (for him)?”
'37': >-
  “By Sītā’s compassion, by the radiance of Rāghava, and by my father’s
  friendship (with the Wind-god), the Fire-god does not burn me.”
'38': >-
  Again the elephant among monkeys pondered for a moment: “How is it that
  binding is possible here for one like me, by these wretches among rākṣasas?”
'39': >-
  “Some fitting counter-action should be made, since prowess abides in me.” Then
  the swift great monkey snapped those bonds—
'40': >-
  and sprang up with speed, and the great monkey roared. Then the illustrious
  son of the Wind approached the city-gate, towering aloft like a mountain-peak.
'41': >-
  He came to that place where the rākṣasas were stationed in divided groups.
  Becoming mountain-like, and then in a moment regaining full mastery of
  himself, he—
'42': >-
  assumed the smallest form, shook off the bonds with ease, and was freed; then
  once more he became resplendent and large, resembling a mountain.
'43': >-
  Looking about, he saw an iron bar resting by the archway. Taking it up, the
  mighty-armed Māruti—its surface clad in dark iron—again slew all those guards.
'44': >-
  Having slain them, fierce in battle and dreadful in valor, he looked once more
  upon Laṅkā—he whose blazing tail was a garland of flames—shining like the sun,
  radiant with beams.
'45': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-third canto of Sundara Kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Cooling of the Fire.”
