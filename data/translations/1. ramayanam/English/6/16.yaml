  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  sixteenth chapter, called “Vibhīṣaṇa’s Lament/Outcry.”
'1': >-
  Rāvaṇa, impelled by Death (Time), addressed harsh words to Vibhīṣaṇa, who had
  spoken beneficial counsel, well-settled and wholesome.
'2': >-
  One might dwell even with a rival—though angry—like a venomous serpent; but
  one should not dwell with an enemy in the guise of a friend, with one who
  serves the foe while speaking as a companion.
'3': >-
  O rākṣasa, I know well the nature of kinsmen throughout all the worlds: in the
  misfortunes of their own relatives, relatives ever rejoice.
'4': >-
  A foremost doer of good, a healer, one devoted to dharma—yet even such a man,
  O rākṣasa, is slighted by his own kinsmen; they mock and abase even a hero.
'5': >-
  Ever delighted in one another’s calamities, intent on harm, with hearts
  concealed, dreadful—such kinsmen are truly terrifying.
'6': >-
  Of old, in the lotus-grove, verses were sung by elephants; having seen men
  with nooses in hand, listen to me as I recount them.
'7': >-
  Neither fire nor other weapons, nor even nooses, are fearful to us; but
  dreadful are our kinsmen, when driven by self-interest—those are fearful to
  us.
'8': >-
  These (kinsmen) will indeed propose means for our seizure—of this there is no
  doubt; from fear in every quarter, the fear arising from kinsmen has been
  allotted to us as a very evil and inevitable lot.
'9': >-
  There is abundance among cattle; there is fear from one’s own kinsmen; there
  is fickleness in women; and there is austerity in a brāhmaṇa.
'10': >-
  Therefore, O gentle one, this is not agreeable to me—that I am honored by the
  world, endowed with sovereignty by birth, and established upon the heads of my
  enemies.
'11': >-
  As drops of water fallen upon lotus-leaves do not cling, so friendship does
  not adhere among the unchaste (the ignoble).
'12': >-
  As, in autumn, even when clouds pour down and thunder, no dampness remains
  (upon the ground as before), so among the unchaste there is no steadfast
  friendship.
'13': >-
  As a honey-bee, from thirst, finding nectar does not stay in one place, so you
  too—so it is among the unchaste: there is no constancy of friendship there.
'14': >-
  As a honey-bee, from thirst, even while drinking a kāśa-flower, may find no
  sweetness there, so among the unchaste one finds no true friendship.
'15': >-
  As an elephant, having bathed, takes dust in its trunk and soils its own body,
  so friendship with the unchaste becomes a defilement.
'16': >-
  If any other were to speak such words as these to you, O night-ranger, he
  would not live even for this very moment; but you—shame on you, the disgrace
  of your lineage!
'17': >-
  Thus addressed with harsh speech, Vibhīṣaṇa, a speaker of righteousness,
  sprang up, mace in hand, together with four rākṣasas.
'18': >-
  Then, Vibhīṣaṇa, born into wrath, spoke these words from the mid-sky—he, the
  illustrious brother of the lord of rākṣasas.
'19': >-
  You are deluded, my king; say to me whatever you wish. Though the eldest is to
  be honored, equal to a father, you do not stand upon the path of dharma. This
  harsh speech of yours, as an elder brother, I do not forgive.
'20': >-
  O Daśānana, the wholesome counsel spoken by one who seeks your welfare is not
  accepted by men lacking self-mastery, who have come under the power of Time.
'21': >-
  Men who speak what is pleasing are easily found at all times, O king; but rare
  indeed is both the speaker and the hearer of what is unpleasing yet salutary.
'22': >-
  Bound by the noose of Time that steals away all beings, I do not wish to
  neglect you as you rush toward destruction—like a blazing fire taken for
  refuge.
'23': >-
  I do not wish to see you slain by Rāma’s arrows—arrows keen, like blazing
  fire, and adorned with golden ornaments.
'24': >-
  Even heroes, strong and well-trained in weapons, sink in battle when overtaken
  by Time—like sand-bridges (raised embankments of sand) collapsing.
'25': >-
  Forgive what has been spoken by me—seeking your good—because of the weight of
  my elder’s position. Protect yourself in every way, and also this city
  together with the rākṣasas. May welfare be yours; I shall depart. Be happy
  without me.
'26': >-
  Since my words—me, who restrain you out of goodwill—do not please you, O
  night-ranger: for when the end-time has come and a man’s lifespan is spent, he
  does not accept what is beneficial, even when spoken by friends.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the sixteenth chapter, called “Vibhīṣaṇa’s Lament/Outcry,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
