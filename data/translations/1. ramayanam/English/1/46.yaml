  Now begins the forty-sixth sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Splitting of Diti’s Womb.”
'1': >-
  When those sons of hers had been slain, Diti, overwhelmed with supreme sorrow,
  spoke these words to her husband, the sage Kaśyapa, who was known by the name
  Marīca.
'2': >-
  “O Blessed One, I am bereft of my sons, slain by your sons of great might. I
  desire a son—one who by long and arduous austerities is won—who shall be the
  slayer of Śakra (Indra).”
'3': >-
  “Therefore I shall practise austerities. It behoves you to grant me a
  conception; and it behoves you to give your consent for that son—mighty and
  sovereign—who shall slay Śakra.”
'4': >-
  Having heard her words then, the great and effulgent Kaśyapa Marīca replied to
  Diti, who was plunged in deepest grief.
'5': >-
  “So be it; welfare be to you. Be pure, O lady rich in penance. You shall give
  birth to a son who will slay Śakra in battle.”
'6': >-
  “But when a thousand years are completed, if you remain pure, then from me you
  shall bring forth a son who will be the destroyer of the three worlds.”
'7': >-
  Having thus spoken, that mighty and radiant one gently wiped her with his
  hand; then, touching her and uttering words of blessing, he departed to engage
  in austerity.
'8': >-
  When he had gone, O best of men, Diti, exceedingly delighted, approached a
  raft of kuśa-grass and practised austerities of the most terrible kind.
'9': >-
  And while she was performing those austerities, Sahasrākṣa (Indra), O best of
  men, attended upon her with the highest excellence of conduct.
'10': >-
  Sahasrākṣa provided her with fire, kuśa-grass, fuel, water, fruits, roots, and
  whatever else she might desire.
'11': >-
  By massaging her limbs and by removing her fatigue, Śakra at all times
  ministered to Diti.
'12': >-
  When a thousand years were nearly complete—ten years yet remaining—O delight
  of the Raghu line, Diti, filled with great joy, spoke to Sahasrākṣa.
'13': >-
  “O foremost among the valiant, ten years remain for me as I continue my
  austerities; then, good betide you, you shall behold your brother.”
'14': >-
  “That son whom, for your sake, I shall conceive—eager for victory—you shall
  enjoy, free from fevered distress, the conquest of the three worlds together
  with him, O child.”
'15': >-
  “At the request of your noble-souled father, the best of the gods, a boon was
  granted to me at the end of a thousand years—concerning a son.”
'16': >-
  Having spoken thus, when the Sun had reached mid-day, the goddess Diti was
  overcome by sleep; and she lay down, placing her feet toward her head.
'17': >-
  Seeing her impure—sleeping with her hair toward the feet, her feet placed
  where the head should be—Śakra laughed and rejoiced.
'18': >-
  Then Purandara (Indra) entered into the hollow within her body, and, O Rāma,
  being of mighty resolve, he split the embryo into seven parts.
'19': >-
  As the embryo was being cleft by the thunderbolt of a hundred joints, it cried
  aloud in a sweet voice, O Rāma; and then Diti awoke.
'20': >-
  Śakra addressed the embryo, saying, “Do not cry, do not cry!” Yet the radiant
  Vāsava (Indra) went on splitting even the weeping one.
'21': >-
  “It must not be slain! It must not be slain!”—thus indeed Diti spoke; and then
  Śakra sprang out, out of reverence for the mother’s word.
'22': >-
  With hands joined in reverence, holding the thunderbolt, Śakra spoke to Diti:
  “O goddess, you were impure, asleep with your feet placed at your head.”
'23': >-
  “Having found that interval, O goddess, I split sevenfold the one who would
  have been Śakra’s slayer in battle. Do you forgive me for that.”
'24': >-
  Thus ends the forty-sixth sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the primordial epic, entitled “The Splitting of Diti’s Womb.”
