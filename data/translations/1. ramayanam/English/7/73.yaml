  Now begins the seventy-third canto of the Uttara-Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Lamentation of the Brāhmaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Having sent forth Śatrughna, the scion of the Raghus—together with his
  brothers—Rāghava rejoiced, and, being happy at heart, ruled and protected the
  kingdom in accordance with dharma.
'2': >-
  Thereafter, after some days had passed, an aged Brāhmaṇa, a countryman (one
  belonging to the realm), came to the king’s gate, bearing in his arms a dead
  child.
'3': >-
  Weeping, and uttering many kinds of words filled with affection and grief, he
  repeatedly spoke this utterance, again and again: “O son, O son!”
'4': >-
  “What evil deed of mine, committed formerly in another body (in a previous
  existence), has borne fruit, that I behold you—my only son—gone to death?”
'5': >-
  “A child not yet come to youth—only five years of age—you have met death out
  of season, for my sorrow, dear little son.”
'6': >-
  “Within a few days I too shall go to death—of this there is no doubt—and your
  mother as well, through grief for you, my child.”
'7': >-
  “I do not remember having spoken falsehood; nor do I remember committing
  violence. I do not remember having committed sin against any living being.”
'8': >-
  “By what evil deed today has this my son—still only a child—gone to the abode
  of Vaivasvata (Yama), without having performed the duties due to his
  forefathers?”
'9': >-
  “I have never before seen, nor heard, anything of such dreadful import—that
  those who have not reached their time should die within the domain of Rāma, as
  now.”
'10': >-
  “Surely some great fault (evil) must exist in Rāma—there is no doubt of it—for
  thus has death come upon children dwelling in his realm.”
'11': >-
  “For children dwelling in other realms there is no fear of death (thus
  untimely). O King, restore this child to life—this child who has fallen under
  the sway of death.”
'12': >-
  “At the king’s gate I shall die, together with my wife, like one without
  protector. Then, O Rāma, having incurred the sin of Brahma-slaying (the guilt
  of a Brāhmaṇa’s death), be happy!”
'13': >-
  “O King, united with your brothers you shall attain long life. We have dwelt
  happily in this your kingdom, O mighty-armed one.”
'14': >-
  “But now, for that reason, we who are under your dominion, O Rāma, have fallen
  under the power of Time (Death); for our happiness is indeed but little—nay,
  it is as though it is not at all.”
'15': >-
  “At present the realm of the great-souled Ikṣvākus has become as though
  without a guardian, having obtained Rāma here as its lord—yet there is certain
  destruction of children.”
'16': >-
  “By the faults of the king, subjects who are not ruled according to proper
  ordinance come to ruin. And when the ruler’s conduct is unrighteous, people
  die before their time.”
'17': >-
  “Or if, in cities and in provinces, people do what is improper and there is no
  protection, then fear arises—wrought by Time.”
'18': >-
  “Clearly, indeed, this will be a fault of the king—there is no doubt; and from
  that, in city and countryside alike, has this slaying (death) of a child
  occurred.”
'19': >-
  Thus, with many kinds of words, repeatedly pressing and reproaching the king,
  tormented by grief, he again and again clasped that child to his breast.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-third canto of the Uttara-Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Lamentation of the Brāhmaṇa.”
