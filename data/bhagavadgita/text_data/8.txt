॥ ॐ श्री परमात्मने नमः ॥
AUm shrI paramAtmane namaH

I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness

॥ अथ श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता ॥
atha shrImadbhagavadgItA

And Now, We start the Holy Bhagavadgita

अथ अष्टमोऽध्यायः ।   अक्षरब्रह्मयोगः
atha aShTamoadhyAyaH    akSharabrahmayogaH

Thus starts the eighth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, which describes akSharabrahma yoga, where Lord Krishna delves further into the nature of eternal all pervading consciousness

अर्जुन उवाच ।
arjuna uvAcha 

After hearing Lord Krishna's explanation of how to attain to the eternal, Arjuna now has a series of questions which he expresses thus.

किं तद् ब्रह्म किमध्यात्मं किं कर्म पुरुषोत्तम ।
अधिभूतं च किं प्रोक्तमधिदैवं किमुच्यते ॥ ८-१॥
kim tad brahma kimadhyAtman kim karma puruShottama 
adhibhUtan cha kim proktamadhidaivam kimuchyate  8.1

O achyuta, what is that which is called as brahma, what is adhyAtmam, what is karma,
what is called as adhibhUtam and what is called as adhidaivam!

अधियज्ञः कथं कोऽत्र देहेऽस्मिन्मधुसूदन ।
प्रयाणकाले च कथं ज्ञेयोऽसि नियतात्मभिः ॥ ८-२॥
adhiyajnaH katham koatra deheasminmadhusUdana 
prayANakAle cha katham jneyoasi niyatAtmabhiH  8.2

O madhusUdana, what is adhiyajna, and who and where is it in the body?
How does one, who is on the path of self-realization, realize You at the time of leaving the body? 

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
shrIbhagavAnuvAcha 

Then, lord kRShNa replied:

अक्षरं ब्रह्म परमं स्वभावोऽध्यात्ममुच्यते ।
भूतभावोद्भवकरो विसर्गः कर्मसंज्ञितः ॥ ८-३॥
akSharam brahma paramam svabhAvoadhyAtmamuchyate 
bhUtabhAvodbhavakaro visargaH karmasanjnitaH  8.3

That which is unchanging and eternal is called as brahma.
Knowing the true nature of the self, is called as adhyAtma. 
That which is born out of the nature of that which has been created, is known by the name, karma.

अधिभूतं क्षरो भावः पुरुषश्चाधिदैवतम् ।
अधियज्ञोऽहमेवात्र देहे देहभृतां वर ॥ ८-४॥
adhibhUtam kSharo bhAvaH puruShashchAdhidaivatam 
adhiyajnoahamevAtra dehe dehabhRtAn vara  8.4

The constantly changing nature of this creation is called as adhibhUtam. That aspect of creation, that moves one forward, known as puruSha, is called as adhidaivatam.
O Arjuna, adhiyajnaH is "I" and "Myself" which is here and now, within this body!

अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम् ।
यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः ॥ ८-५॥
antakAle cha mAmeva smaranmuktvA kalevaram 
yaH prayAti sa madbhAvam yAti nAstyatra sanshayaH  8.5

O Arjuna, there is absolutely no doubt that someone who remembers the true "Me" as one who leaves the body at the end of one's time, attains to "Myself"

यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम् ।
तं तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावितः ॥ ८-६॥
yam yam vApi smaranbhAvam tyajatyante kalevaram 
tam tamevaiti kaunteya sadA tadbhAvabhAvitaH  8.6

O Son of Kunti, whichever state of being one remembers as one leaves this mortal body, one continues to stay in that same state of remembrance and that becomes one's nature.

तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च ।
मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयः ॥ ८-७॥
tasmAtsarveShu kAleShu mAmanusmara yudhya cha 
mayyarpitamanobuddhirmAmevaiShyasyasanshayaH 8.7

And so O Arjuna, always remember the true "Me", even as you participate in this fight.
Wihtout a doubt, someone who has dedicated one's mind in "Myself" shall attain to "Me".

अभ्यासयोगयुक्तेन चेतसा नान्यगामिना ।
परमं पुरुषं दिव्यं याति पार्थानुचिन्तयन् ॥ ८-८॥
abhyAsayogaayuktena chetasA nAnyagAminA 
paramam puruSham divyan yAti pArthAnuchintayan  8.8

O Partha, with an unwavering awareness that is regularly united with the practice of yoga, one shall certainly attain to that ultimate state of self-realization.

कविं पुराणमनुशासितार-

By meditating on the source of all intelligence, who is the most ancient, all controlling, who is more minute than the minutest; By meditating on the supreme nature of the self, which sustains everything, whose form is beyond the scope of thought; By going beyond one's nature of tamas and by meditating on that which shines like the sun,

प्रयाणकाले मनसाऽचलेन
भक्त्या युक्तो योगबलेन चैव ।
भ्रुवोर्मध्ये प्राणमावेश्य सम्यक्

One who at the time of death, with unmoving mind that is immersed in devotion, by the strength gained through the practice of yoga, fixes the prANa between one's eyebrows,
Such a person attains to that eternal and ultimate state of being, called puruSha.
		
यदक्षरं वेदविदो वदन्ति

yadakSharam vedavido vadanti

O Arjuna, I shall now briefly talk to you about that eternal, unchanging state of being which is described by enlightened beings, that state in which those who are devoid of entanglements establish themselves, that state in pursuit of which people take up the path of brahmacharya.
		
सर्वद्वाराणि संयम्य मनो हृदि निरुध्य च ।
मूर्ध्न्याधायात्मनः प्राणमास्थितो योगधारणाम् ॥ ८-१२॥
sarvadvArANi sanyamya mano hRdi nirudhya cha 
mUrdhnyAdhAyAtmanaH prANamAsthito yogaadhAraNAm  8.12

After controlling all the gateways into one's self, by fixing one's manas in one's hRdaya, and by bringing one's prANa in between the eyebrows, one who establishes oneself in yoga, 

ओमित्येकाक्षरं ब्रह्म व्याहरन्मामनुस्मरन् ।
यः प्रयाति त्यजन्देहं स याति परमां गतिम् ॥ ८-१३॥
omityekAkSharam brahma vyAharanmAmanusmaran 
yaH prayAti tyajandeham sa yAti paramAn gatim  8.13

the one, who in such a state then continuously remembers "Me" through repeated usage of the cosmic sound, "praNava" or "OmkAra", the one who departs from this mortal body, attains to this ultimate state.

अनन्यचेताः सततं यो मां स्मरति नित्यशः ।
तस्याहं सुलभः पार्थ नित्ययुक्तस्य योगिनः ॥ ८-१४॥
ananyachetAH satatam yo mAn smarati nityashaH 
tasyAham sulabhaH pArtha nityayuktasya yogainaH  8.14

O pArtha, the one who always remembers "Me", constantly without any other thought in the mind, to such an immersed yogi, "I" am very easily attainable.

मामुपेत्य पुनर्जन्म दुःखालयमशाश्वतम् ।
नाप्नुवन्ति महात्मानः संसिद्धिं परमां गताः ॥ ८-१५॥
mAmupetya punarjanma duHkhAlayamashAshvatam 
nApnuvanti mahAtmAnaH sansiddhim paramAn gatAH  8.15

Having attained to the true sense of "Me", these great beings are no more subject to rebirth in this world, which is transient and full of misery.
They have attained to the highest of attainments.

आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोकाः पुनरावर्तिनोऽर्जुन ।
मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते ॥ ८-१६॥
AbrahmabhuvanAllokAH punarAvartinoarjuna 
mAmupetya tu kaunteya punarjanma na vidyate  8.16

In all the worlds of this material creation, up to the highest abode of Brahma, you will be subject to rebirth, O Arjuna.
But upon attaining to the abode of "Me", O son of Kunti, there is no further rebirth.

सहस्रयुगपर्यन्तमहर्यद् ब्रह्मणो विदुः ।
रात्रिं युगसहस्रान्तां तेऽहोरात्रविदो जनाः ॥ ८-१७॥
sahasrayugaparyantamaharyad brahmaNo viduH 
rAtrin yugasahasrAntAn teahorAtravido janAH  8.17

Those who have attained to the realm of brahman, experience one thousand yugas as a span of a day and the next one thousand yugas as a night.

अव्यक्ताद् व्यक्तयः सर्वाः प्रभवन्त्यहरागमे ।
रात्र्यागमे प्रलीयन्ते तत्रैवाव्यक्तसंज्ञके ॥ ८-१८॥
avyaktAd vyaktayaH sarvAH prabhavantyaharAgame 
rAtryAgame pralIyante tatraivAvyaktasanjnake  8.18

At the advent of Brahma’s day, everything manifests from the unmanifest. 
At nighfall, everything dissolves back into the unmanifest.

भूतग्रामः स एवायं भूत्वा भूत्वा प्रलीयते ।
रात्र्यागमेऽवशः पार्थ प्रभवत्यहरागमे ॥ ८-१९॥
bhUtagrAmaH sa evAyam bhUtvA bhUtvA pralIyate 
rAtryAgameavashaH pArtha prabhavatyaharAgame  8.19

Clusters of such creation, gets created and dissolved over and over again.
At the break of dawn they are manifest, and with nighfall they get dissolved again as if beyond their control.

परस्तस्मात्तु भावोऽन्योऽव्यक्तोऽव्यक्तात्सनातनः ।
यः स सर्वेषु भूतेषु नश्यत्सु न विनश्यति ॥ ८-२०॥
parastasmAttu bhAvoanyoavyaktoavyaktAtsanAtanaH 
yaH sa sarveShu bhUteShu nashyatsu na vinashyati  8.20

And beyond these cycles of creation and dissolution, exists that state of being which is eternal and ultimate.
This ultimate state of being, exists in all that is created, but doesn't get destroyed during dissolution.

अव्यक्तोऽक्षर इत्युक्तस्तमाहुः परमां गतिम् ।
यं प्राप्य न निवर्तन्ते तद्धाम परमं मम ॥ ८-२१॥
avyaktoakShara ityuktastamAhuH paramAn gatim 
yam prApya na nivartante taddhAma paramam mama  8.21

This state which is indescribable and unchanging is called the ultimate state of existence.
By attaining to this state, one is no longer bound by the cycles of creation. That is the true abode of "Me".

पुरुषः स परः पार्थ भक्त्या लभ्यस्त्वनन्यया ।
यस्यान्तःस्थानि भूतानि येन सर्वमिदं ततम् ॥ ८-२२॥
puruShaH sa paraH pArtha bhaktyA labhyastvananyayA 
yasyAntaHsthAni bhUtAni yena sarvamidam tatam  8.22

O Partha, that ultimate state of existence, called puruSha, which pervades all of creation, can only be attained through unparallelled devotion.

यत्र काले त्वनावृत्तिमावृत्तिं चैव योगिनः ।
प्रयाता यान्ति तं कालं वक्ष्यामि भरतर्षभ ॥ ८-२३॥
yatra kAle tvanAvRttimAvRttin chaiva yogainaH 
prayAtA yAnti tam kAlam vakShyAmi bharatarShabha  8.23

O Best of Bharatas, I shall now speak to you of the signs that indicate whether one has crossed beyond the cycles of birth and death, or if one is still bound to them.

अग्निर्ज्योतिरहः शुक्लः षण्मासा उत्तरायणम् ।
तत्र प्रयाता गच्छन्ति ब्रह्म ब्रह्मविदो जनाः ॥ ८-२४॥
agnirjyotirahaH shuklaH ShaNmAsA uttarAyaNam 
tatra prayAtA gachChanti brahma brahmavido janAH  8.24

Those who know the ultimate brahman, and who depart from this world, during the six months of the sun’s northern run, the bright fortnight of the moon, and the bright part of the day, realize the true nature of brahman and become a part of it.

धूमो रात्रिस्तथा कृष्णः षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम् ।
तत्र चान्द्रमसं ज्योतिर्योगी प्राप्य निवर्तते ॥ ८-२५॥
dhUmo rAtristathA kRShNaH ShaNmAsA dakShiNAyanam 
tatra chAndramasan jyotiryogaI prApya nivartate  8.25

Those who pass away during the six months of the sun’s southern run, the dark fortnight of the moon, the time of smoke, the night, attain the celestial abodes. 
After enjoying celestial pleasures, they return to the cycles of birth and death.

शुक्लकृष्णे गती ह्येते जगतः शाश्वते मते ।
एकया यात्यनावृत्तिमन्ययावर्तते पुनः ॥ ८-२६॥
shuklakRShNe gatI hyete jagataH shAshvate mate 
ekayA yAtyanAvRttimanyayAvartate punaH  8.26

These two, bright and dark paths, always exist in this world. The way of light leads to liberation and the way of darkness leads to rebirth.

नैते सृती पार्थ जानन्योगी मुह्यति कश्चन ।

naite sRtI pArtha jAnanyogaI muhyati kashchana 
tasmAtsarveShu kAleShu yogaayukto bhavArjuna  8.27

O Partha, a true yogi does not get deluded even by knowing this secret of existence.
Therefore O Arjuna, strive to be a yogi.

वेदेषु यज्ञेषु तपःसु चैव
दानेषु यत्पुण्यफलं प्रदिष्टम् ।
अत्येति तत्सर्वमिदं विदित्वा

vedeShu yajneShu tapaHsu chaiva
dAneShu yatpuNyaphalam pradiShTam 
atyeti tatsarvamidam viditvA
yogaI param sthAnamupaiti chAdyam  8.28

All great reslts one can attain through the rituals of vedas, yajnas, austerities and donations;
A yogi gains much more than all of them combined by just realizing this one truth of existence, and then attains to the supreme abode of self.

ॐ तत्सदिति श्रीमद्भगवद्गीतासूपनिषत्सु
