  Now begins the one-hundred-and-tenth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Severing of Rāvaṇa’s One Hundred Heads.”
'1': >-
  As Rāma and Rāvaṇa fought thus in that battle, all beings beheld them, their
  inmost hearts filled with wonder.
'2': >-
  Indeed, as they pressed each other hard in the fight, those two excellent
  chariots, each enraged at the other, each charging the other, bore down upon
  one another.
'3': >-
  Intent on each other’s destruction, they became terrible to behold; and there
  were circles and lanes of movement, advances and returns again and again.
'4': >-
  Displaying many kinds of charioteer-born manoeuvres, the two drivers showed
  their skill; Rāma harassed Rāvaṇa, and Rāvaṇa too assailed the scion of Raghu.
'5': >-
  Their two splendid cars, in their swift advances and withdrawals, kept hurling
  forth nets of arrows at each other as they sped on.
'6': >-
  They ranged over the battlefield, roaring like two cloud-masses with rain; and
  having displayed then many kinds of motion in the combat,
'7': >-
  they once more stood facing each other—pole to pole of the two chariots, and
  the faces of the horses set face to face.
'8': >-
  Then, as they stood thus, their standards met standard to standard; thereafter
  Rāma, with sharp arrows loosed from his bow,
'9': >-
  made four blazing steeds recoil, each with four shafts. Enraged at the forcing
  back of his horses,
'10': >-
  Daśānana released ten keen arrows at Rāghava. Though grievously pierced by
  mighty Daśagrīva,
'11': >-
  Rāghava underwent no change, nor was he distressed; and again he hurled forth
  arrows whose sound was like adamant.
'12': >-
  Daśānana, aiming at Mātali, the charioteer of the wielder of the thunderbolt,
  shot; yet the arrows of great speed that fell upon Mātali’s body
'13': >-
  caused not even the slightest bewilderment or pain in the combat. Angered by
  that affront—not for himself, but for Mātali—
'14': >-
  Rāghava, with a net of arrows, drove his foe back. Twenty, thirty, sixty—then
  by hundreds and by thousands,
'15': >-
  the heroic Rāghava discharged his shafts into the enemy’s chariot. Rāvaṇa too,
  then, enraged, the lord of the rākṣasas standing on his car,
'16': >-
  assailed Rāma in the battle with a shower of maces and clubs. Thereupon the
  fight that arose again was tumultuous, hair-raising.
'17': >-
  By the din of maces, clubs, and iron bludgeons, and by the whistling rush of
  arrows’ feathers, the seven oceans were thrown into commotion.
'18': >-
  And as the oceans churned, all the Dānavas dwelling on the nether regions were
  afflicted, and serpents by the thousand were distressed.
'19': >-
  The whole earth trembled, with its mountains, forests, and groves; the sun
  became bereft of splendour, and the wind did not blow.
'20': >-
  Then the gods with the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and the great Ṛṣis, and the
  Kiṃnaras and mighty serpents—all of them—fell into anxious thought.
'21': >-
  “Let there be welfare for cows and brāhmaṇas; let the worlds stand firm for
  ever. May Rāghava be victorious in the battle over Rāvaṇa, lord of the
  rākṣasas!”
'22': >-
  Thus praying, the gods with the hosts of Ṛṣis then beheld the combat between
  Rāma and Rāvaṇa—most dreadful, causing the hair to stand on end.
'23': >-
  Companies of Gandharvas and Apsarases, seeing that unparalleled battle, spoke
  of the sky as sky-like, the ocean as ocean-like,
'24': >-
  and the battle of Rāma and Rāvaṇa as befitting Rāma and Rāvaṇa; thus speaking,
  they watched that war between Rāma and Rāvaṇa.
'25': >-
  Thereupon, mighty-armed Rāma, increaser of the fame of the Raghu line, in
  wrath fitted to his bow an arrow like a venomous serpent,
'26': >-
  and severed Rāvaṇa’s head, adorned with radiant, blazing ear-ornaments. That
  head, fallen on the earth, was seen then by the three worlds.
'27': >-
  And another head, resembling that very one, rose up upon Rāvaṇa; swiftly did
  Rāma of quick deeds cast it down with a rapid hand.
'28': >-
  A second head of Rāvaṇa was cut off in battle by shafts; and no sooner was
  that head severed than it was again seen (to appear).
'29': >-
  That too was cut down by Rāma’s arrows, blazing like lightning. Thus indeed a
  hundred heads, all of equal splendour, were severed.
'30': >-
  Yet still no end of Rāvaṇa was seen, nor any reaching of the limit of his
  life. Then Rāghava, the heroic knower of every weapon, increaser of Kauśalyā’s
  joy,
'31': though equipped with many arrows, began to ponder.
'32': >-
  “Those by which Mārīca was slain; those by which Khara with Dūṣaṇa was slain;
  by which Virādha at Krauñcāvaṭa, and Kabandha in the Daṇḍaka forest (were
  destroyed);
'33': >-
  by which the sāla trees and mountains were split, Vāli was smitten, and even
  the ocean was stirred—these very arrows are all proven true in battle for me.
'34': >-
  “What then is the cause by which, upon Rāvaṇa of diminished splendour, they
  have not their effect?” Thus absorbed in thought, yet ever vigilant in the
  fight, Rāghava rained showers of arrows upon Rāvaṇa’s chest.
'35': >-
  Rāvaṇa also then, enraged, the lord of the rākṣasas standing on his chariot,
  assailed Rāma in battle with a shower of maces and clubs.
'36': >-
  That great battle which thus arose was tumultuous and hair-raising—now in the
  mid-air, now on the earth, and again upon the mountain-tops.
'37': >-
  While gods, Dānavas, Yakṣas, Piśācas, serpents, and rākṣasas looked on, that
  great battle continued through the whole night.
'38': >-
  Neither night nor day, nor a muhūrta, nor even a moment did the combat between
  Rāma and Rāvaṇa come to a pause.
'39': >-
  Then the great-souled charioteer of the gods’ foremost car, seeing no certain
  victory in that battle between Daśaratha’s son and the lord of rākṣasas,
  quickly spoke words to Rāma, who was intent on the fight.
'40': >-
  Thus ends, in the venerable holy Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the First Poem, in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the one-hundred-and-tenth canto, entitled “The Severing of
  Rāvaṇa’s One Hundred Heads.”
