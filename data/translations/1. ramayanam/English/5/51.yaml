  Now begins the fifty-first canto (sarga) of the glorious Valmiki-Ramayana, in
  the Sundara-kanda, called “Hanuman’s Counsel (Admonition).”
'1': >-
  Having observed that mighty, high-souled one, the best of monkeys—himself
  endowed with steadfast courage—unagitated, spoke to the ten-headed Ravana
  words full of meaning.
'2': >-
  “I have come here into your presence, O lord of the rakshasas, as a messenger
  sent by Sugriva. The lord of the monkeys, your brother, conveys to you his
  welfare and well-being.
'3': >-
  Listen to the command of your brother Sugriva, the great-souled: words allied
  to dharma and to advantage, and wholesome both for this world and for the
  world hereafter.
'4': >-
  There was a king named Dasharatha, rich in chariots, elephants, and
  horses—like a father and kinsman to the world—shining with a splendour equal
  to the lord of the gods.
'5': >-
  His eldest son was the mighty-armed Rama, dearest and most excellent—who, by
  his father’s command, went forth and entered the Dandaka forest.
'6': >-
  With Lakshmana as his brother-companion, and with Sita as his wife, Rama—of
  great radiance—took refuge in the righteous path.
'7': >-
  His wife, famed as Sita, was abducted at Janasthana—she who is the daughter of
  the Videhan king, the great-souled Janaka.
'8': >-
  Searching for that divine lady, the prince with his younger brother came to
  Rishyamuka and there met with Sugriva.
'9': >-
  To him (Rama) Sugriva promised the search for Sita; and Rama, for Sugriva’s
  sake, undertook to restore the kingdom to the monkey-lord.
'10': >-
  Thereafter, in battle, the prince slew Vali; and Sugriva was established in
  the kingdom as the overlord of hosts of monkeys and bears.
'11': >-
  Vali, the foremost of monkeys, was known to you from before; he was struck
  down in combat by that monkey-slaying arrow—by a single shaft.
'12': >-
  Sugriva, intent upon the search for Sita and true in battle, sent forth the
  monkeys—he, the lord of the monkeys—into all directions.
'13': >-
  Thousands, and hundreds, and myriads of monkeys are searching in every
  quarter—below and above, even through the sky.
'14': >-
  Some among them are like Garuda; some are like the wind itself—swift in
  motion, unhindered in their course—heroic monkeys of great strength.
'15': >-
  But I am Hanuman by name, the true-born son of Maruta (the Wind-god). For
  Sita’s sake I quickly crossed the ocean that stretches a hundred yojanas.
'16': >-
  Leaping over the sea, I came here wishing to see you; and as I wandered, I
  beheld Janaka’s daughter within your palace.
'17': >-
  Therefore, O wise one, you who know dharma and advantage, and whose
  possessions have been gained through austerity— you ought not to detain
  another man’s wife.
'18': >-
  For in deeds opposed to dharma—fraught with many perils and striking at the
  very root—men of understanding such as you do not become entangled.
'19': >-
  Who—among gods or asuras, even—has the power to stand before the arrows of
  Rama, that follow his wrath, and that have been released by Lakshmana?
'20': >-
  And, O king, in the three worlds there exists no one who, having done injury
  to Raghava, could thereafter attain happiness.
'21': >-
  Therefore, heed this counsel—beneficial for all three times (past, present,
  and future), righteous, and in accordance with true advantage: let Janaki be
  given back to the lord of men.
'22': >-
  For I have seen this goddess; what is hard to obtain has been obtained here.
  The remaining work that must be done—Raghava will be the instrument for that.
'23': >-
  Sita has been recognized by me—she is wholly given over to grief—she whom you
  do not recognize in your own house, like a serpentess with five hoods.
'24': >-
  She cannot be subdued—even by the immortals together with the asuras—like food
  eaten with great force after being thoroughly tainted by poison, which cannot
  be digested away.
'25': >-
  That store of merit and righteousness which you have acquired through the heat
  of austerities—your very life-breath as it were—should not be destroyed; it is
  not right to ruin it.
'26': >-
  That inviolability which you perceive in yourself because of your
  austerities—there is here a great reason even beyond that, for your protection
  even against the gods with the asuras.
'27': >-
  Sugriva is neither a god, nor a yaksha, nor a rakshasa; and Raghava, O king,
  is a human. Sugriva too is the lord of monkeys. Therefore, O king, how will
  you protect your life?
'28': >-
  Indeed there is no ‘ending’ or setting aside of dharma that is joined to the
  fruits of adharma; rather, that very fruit follows inevitably—while dharma
  itself destroys adharma.
'29': >-
  The fruit of dharma has, for the present, been attained by you—of this there
  is no doubt; but the fruit of this adharma also you will very quickly attain.
'30': >-
  Knowing the slaughter at Janasthana, and likewise the slaying of Vali, and the
  friendship of Rama and Sugriva—understand what is beneficial for yourself.
'31': >-
  Even I alone, if I so desired, am able to destroy Lanka together with its
  horses, chariots, and elephants; but such is not my resolve.
'32': >-
  For Rama has vowed in the presence of the hosts of monkeys and bears the
  extermination of those enemies by whom Sita was violated and assaulted.
'33': >-
  For even Indra, the destroyer of forts, if he acted against Rama, would not
  attain happiness—what then of any other, and how much more of one such as you?
'34': >-
  She whom you know as ‘Sita’, who stands within your house—know her to be
  ‘Kala-ratri’, the night of doom, the destroyer of all Lanka.
'35': >-
  Therefore, enough of this noose of Time—having the form of Sita’s body—hanging
  of itself upon your shoulder; think of your own welfare and safety.
'36': >-
  Behold this city—its ramparts and gateways—burning, kindled by the splendour
  of Sita and inflamed by the wrath of Rama.
'37': >-
  Do not bring to ruin your own friends, ministers, kinsmen, brothers,
  well-wishers, sons—nor your pleasures, your wives, nor Lanka itself.
'38': >-
  This is truth, O best of kings of rakshasas: listen to my words—especially
  since I am a monkey, a messenger, and a servant of Rama.
'39': >-
  Rama, of great renown, is able—having withdrawn all worlds with all beings,
  moving and unmoving—to create them once again just as before.
'40': >-
  Among gods, asuras, and lords of men; among yakshas, rakshasas, and serpents;
  among vidyadharas, nagas, gandharvas, and even among beasts—
'41': >-
  Among siddhas, lords of kinnara; and among birds everywhere—at all times, in
  all beings, in every place—there is none equal to him.
'42': >-
  If anyone were to fight against Rama, whose valour is like Vishnu’s, and after
  doing such a displeasure to the lord of all worlds here—then for you, against
  Rama, the lion among kings, life will be hard to obtain.
'43': >-
  Even the gods and the daityas, O lord of night-rangers, and the gandharvas,
  vidyadharas, nagas, and yakshas—all of them are not able to stand in battles
  against Rama, the leader of the three worlds.
'44': >-
  Neither Brahma the Self-born, the four-faced, nor Rudra the three-eyed, the
  destroyer of Tripura, nor Indra the great lord, leader of the gods—are able to
  stand in combat against Raghava.
'45': >-
  Hearing the ape’s incomparable and unwelcome speech—spoken without weakness
  yet with fitting excellence—Ravana, the ten-headed, his eyes widened with
  anger, commanded the slaying of that great monkey.
'46': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-first canto of the Sundara-kanda in the holy
  Valmiki-Ramayana, the ancient epic, called “Hanuman’s Counsel (Admonition).”
