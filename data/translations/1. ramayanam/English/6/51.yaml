'0': >-
  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-first canto, named “The Marching Forth of Dhūmrākṣa.”
'1': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa heard that tumultuous clamour of the mighty-spirited
  vānaras—roaring aloud together with the rākṣasas.
'2': >-
  Hearing that exceedingly loud din—deep, rich, and resonant—he then spoke words
  in the midst of those ministers.
'3': >-
  “Just as this mighty multitude of vānaras has become exultant and assembled,
  so indeed is this very great roar—like the thunder of rumbling clouds.”
'4': >-
  “A great joy among them is clearly manifest—of this there is no doubt; for by
  their vast shouts the salt ocean itself is thrown into agitation.”
'5': >-
  “And those two brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, have been bound by sharp arrows;
  yet this exceedingly great roar seems to beget suspicion in me.”
'6': >-
  Having thus spoken to his counsellors, the lord of the rākṣasas addressed
  there the rākṣasas who were standing near at hand.
'7': >-
  “Let it be swiftly ascertained, regarding all these forest-dwellers, what
  cause of rejoicing has arisen when the time was one of grief.”
'8': >-
  Thus spoken to, those rākṣasas, greatly alarmed, climbed upon the rampart and
  beheld the army protected by the great-souled Sugrīva.
'9': >-
  And seeing the two illustrious Rāghavas freed from that most dreadful bondage
  of arrows, all the rākṣasas fell into despondency.
'10': >-
  All of them, their hearts terrified, descended from the rampart; pale, those
  dreadful rākṣasas approached the lord of rākṣasas.
'11': >-
  Those rākṣasas, faces fallen at that unwelcome sight, fully reported to
  Rāvaṇa—properly and in due manner—for they were skilled in speech.
'12': >-
  “Those two brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, whom Indrajit in battle had bound with
  a bondage of arrows, making their arms motionless and unmoving—”
'13': >-
  “—they are now seen, released from that arrow-bondage, in the field of battle;
  like two mighty elephants, equal in valour to lordly elephants, who have
  snapped their nooses.”
'14': >-
  Hearing their words, the mighty lord of rākṣasas, overwhelmed by anxiety and
  grief, became pale of countenance.
'15': >-
  “Bound by Indrajit in battle with terrible arrows—like venomous
  serpents—endowed with boons, unerring, and radiant as the sun—”
'16': >-
  “If, after encountering that bond of weapons, my enemies have been released,
  then I behold this whole army as standing in doubt.”
'17': >-
  “Surely those arrows, blazing with the fire’s own energy, have proved
  fruitless—those by which, in battle, the lives of my enemies were seized and
  held.”
'18': >-
  Having spoken thus, and becoming enraged, breathing hard like a serpent, he
  spoke in the midst of the rākṣasas to a rākṣasa named Dhūmrākṣa.
'19': >-
  “Endowed with great strength, O rākṣasa of dreadful prowess—go forth quickly
  for the slaying of Rāma, together with the vānaras.”
'20': >-
  Thus addressed by the wise lord of rākṣasas, Dhūmrākṣa circumambulated him and
  then swiftly went out from the royal palace.
'21': >-
  Coming out through that gateway, he said to the commander of the forces:
  “Hasten the army quickly—why delay, when I desire to fight?”
'22': >-
  Hearing Dhūmrākṣa’s command, the chief of the army, accompanied by his troops,
  vigorously set the forces in array by Rāvaṇa’s order.
'23': >-
  Those powerful night-rangers, terrible in form, with bells bound upon them,
  roaring and exultant, gathered all around Dhūmrākṣa.
'24': >-
  Bearing various weapons in their hands—wielding spears and hammers—bearing
  maces, battle-axes, staves, iron clubs and mallets as well—
'25': >-
  With iron bars, javelins, darts, nooses, and axes, those dreadful rākṣasas
  marched forth, roaring like clouds.
'26': >-
  Others, armoured and mounted on chariots adorned with banners—fashioned with
  networks of gold—and drawn by asses of diverse faces—marched out as well.
'27': >-
  With exceedingly swift horses and with elephants maddened in rut, those tigers
  among the rākṣasas went forth—like tigers, unapproachable.
'28': >-
  Dhūmrākṣa, whose chariot thundered like asses, mounted a splendid chariot
  drawn by asses adorned with gold, having faces like wolves and lions.
'29': >-
  That great hero Dhūmrākṣa, surrounded by rākṣasas, went out laughing through
  the western gate, to where Hanūmān was stationed.
'30': >-
  Mounting that excellent chariot drawn by asses, noisy with the sound of asses,
  that exceedingly dreadful rākṣasa—terrible to behold—advanced.
'31': >-
  Cruel birds flying in the sky foretold obstruction; and upon the forepart of
  his chariot a great and fearsome vulture alighted.
'32': >-
  And flesh-eating birds, clinging to the tip of the banner, fell down; and a
  great white headless trunk, drenched in blood, fell upon the earth.
'33': >-
  Uttering inharmonious cries, and striking down Dhūmrākṣa’s omens, the deity
  rained blood, and the earth trembled.
'34': >-
  The wind blew contrary, accompanied by the sound of thunderbolts; and there
  the quarters, covered by masses of darkness, did not shine forth.
'35': >-
  Then Dhūmrākṣa, seeing those portents—fear-bringing for the rākṣasas—arisen,
  exceedingly terrible, became distressed; and all the rākṣasas who went before
  Dhūmrākṣa were confounded.
'36': >-
  Then that exceedingly fearsome and powerful one, eager for battle, having come
  forth surrounded by many night-rangers, beheld that vast vānarī host—like a
  great flood—protected by the arms of the Rāghava.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-first canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, named “The Marching Forth
  of Dhūmrākṣa,” in the revered, glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the primordial
  epic.
