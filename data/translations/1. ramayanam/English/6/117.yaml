  Now, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-seventeenth sarga, called “The Beholding of Sītā’s Husband’s
  Face.”
'1': >-
  Having paid reverence, that foremost of the monkeys, of great wisdom, spoke to
  Rāma—lotus-petalled-eyed, the best of all who bear the bow:
'2': >-
  “She for whose sake this undertaking was begun, and for whom this fruit of all
  deeds has now arisen—thou shouldst behold that lady, Maithilī, who is scorched
  with grief.”
'3': >-
  “For Maithilī, overwhelmed by sorrow, her eyes troubled with tears, having
  heard of the victory, longs to see thee.”
'4': >-
  “And through former assurance and trust she has said to me, her eyes in
  agitation: ‘I desire to behold my lord.’”
'5': >-
  Thus addressed by Hanumān, Rāma—foremost among the upholders of dharma—was
  suddenly seized by reflection, his eyes slightly flooded with tears.
'6': >-
  He, heaving a long sigh and looking upon the ground, spoke to Vibhīṣaṇa, who
  stood near, cloud-hued in complexion.
'7': >-
  “Bring hither Sītā without delay—Vaidehī, anointed with divine unguents,
  adorned with divine ornaments, her head bathed.”
'8': >-
  Thus spoken to by Rāma, Vibhīṣaṇa, hastening, entered the inner apartments and
  urged Sītā onward with the women of his household.
'9': >-
  Then, seeing the greatly fortunate Sītā, the illustrious lord of the rākṣasas,
  Vibhīṣaṇa—humble, with hands joined and bound at his head—spoke:
'10': >-
  “O Vaidehī, anointed with divine unguents and adorned with divine
  ornaments—mount the conveyance; auspiciousness be to thee. Thy husband desires
  to behold thee.”
'11': >-
  Thus addressed, Vaidehī replied to Vibhīṣaṇa: “O lord of the rākṣasas, I
  desire to behold my husband without bathing.”
'12': >-
  Hearing her words, Vibhīṣaṇa answered: “Even as Rāma, thy husband, has
  commanded, so oughtest thou to do.”
'13': >-
  Hearing that word of his, Maithilī—devoted to her lord as to a deity, the
  chaste lady, encompassed by wifely devotion—replied, “So be it.”
'14': >-
  Then Sītā, her head bathed and properly arrayed according to due observances,
  wearing most precious ornaments and clad in garments of great worth,
'15': >-
  was placed upon a radiant palanquin, covered with exceedingly costly cloth,
  well-guarded by many rākṣasas; and thus Vibhīṣaṇa brought her forth.
'16': >-
  Approaching the great-souled Rāma—though knowing him to be absorbed in
  thought—Vibhīṣaṇa, bowing down yet rejoicing, announced that Sītā had arrived.
'17': >-
  Hearing that she had come—she who had long dwelt in the rākṣasa-house—Rāghava,
  slayer of foes, was seized by wrath, by joy, and by helpless distress all at
  once.
'18': >-
  Then, considering with deliberation Sītā seated in the vehicle, Rāghava—though
  not glad—spoke these words to Vibhīṣaṇa:
'19': >-
  “O gentle lord of the rākṣasas, ever delighting in my victory, let Vaidehī
  quickly draw near to me.”
'20': >-
  Hearing that command of Rāghava, Vibhīṣaṇa, knower of dharma, at once caused
  the clearing of the place there.
'21': >-
  There, attendants wearing tunics and turbans, holding staffs and clubs in
  their hands, went about on all sides, driving those warriors back.
'22': >-
  In every direction, the multitudes of bears, monkeys, and rākṣasas, being
  pushed back, at last withdrew far away.
'23': >-
  As they were being driven back, a very great clamour arose—like the roar of
  the ocean when it is lashed and blown about by the wind.
'24': >-
  Seeing them driven away on every side, alarmed and in commotion, Rāghava
  restrained that act—out of courtesy and also out of intolerance of it.
'25': >-
  And, in agitation, Rāma spoke—burning, as it were, with his eyes—to the
  great-wise Vibhīṣaṇa, these reproachful words:
'26': >-
  “For what reason, disregarding me, dost thou distress this people? Turn them
  back—this multitude is my own people; let there be no fear.”
'27': >-
  “Neither houses, nor garments, nor the concealment of walls, nor such royal
  honours—none of these is a covering of conduct for a woman.”
'28': >-
  “In times of calamity, in hardship, in war, at a svayaṃvara, at a sacrifice,
  or even at a wedding, a woman’s appearance is not thereby tainted.”
'29': >-
  “She indeed has fallen into misfortune and has been joined with grievous
  hardship; there is no fault in her being seen—especially in my presence.”
'30': >-
  “Therefore, having descended from the palanquin, let Vaidehī approach on foot.
  Let these dwellers of the forest behold her near me.”
'31': >-
  Thus spoken to by Rāma, Vibhīṣaṇa—after reflection—brought Sītā near to Rāma,
  in a manner becoming one humble.
'32': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa and Sugrīva, and Hanumān the monkey also, hearing Rāma’s words,
  became exceedingly distressed.
'33': >-
  And by his dreadful gestures, showing indifference toward his wife, they
  surmised that Rāghava was, as it were, displeased with Sītā.
'34': >-
  Maithilī, shrinking within her limbs from shame, followed by Vibhīṣaṇa,
  approached her husband.
'35': >-
  Through amazement, and joy, and affection, that wife-devoted
  lady—gentle-faced, with a face yet gentler—looked upon the gentle face of her
  husband.
'36': >-
  Then, casting away the weariness of her heart, having long gazed upon the
  beloved whom she had not seen for so long—his countenance radiant with the
  splendour of the full moon—she, whose face was like the spotless moon, became
  as though filled with that moonlike light.
'37': >-
  Thus ends, in the Vedic-sage tradition, in the illustrious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa—the primordial epic—in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-seventeenth sarga, called “The Beholding of Sītā’s Husband’s
  Face.”
