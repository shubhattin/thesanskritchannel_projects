'0': >-
  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki–Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  sixty-fourth sarga, called “The Counsel concerning the Leaping across the
  Ocean.”
'1': >-
  Having learned it from the king of vultures (Sampāti), the monkeys—springing
  up—gathered together; filled with joy and gladness, those of lion-like prowess
  raised loud cries.
'2': >-
  Hearing Sampāti’s words regarding the destruction of Rāvaṇa, the hosts of
  monkeys, exultant and longing to behold Sītā, came to the sea.
'3': >-
  Reaching that region, those of dreadful valour beheld the ocean—standing there
  like the vast image and reflection of the entire great world.
'4': >-
  Approaching the northern quarter of the southern ocean, those mighty
  monkey-heroes made their encampment there.
'5': >-
  In some places it appeared as though asleep; in other places as though
  sporting; and in some places it was covered over by massed heaps of waters
  that rose like mountains.
'6': >-
  Seeing it crowded with lords of the Dānavas and with dwellers of the nether
  regions of Pātāla—an awe-inspiring sight—the great elephant-like monkeys were
  cast into dejection.
'7': >-
  Gazing upon the ocean, hard to cross like the very sky, all the Vānaras
  together grew despondent, saying, “How is the task to be accomplished?”
'8': >-
  Seeing that army downcast from looking upon the sea, the foremost of monkeys
  consoled the monkeys who were distressed with fear.
'9': >-
  Let not the mind give way to despondency; despondency is fraught with fault.
  Despondency destroys a man, as a serpent, enraged, destroys a child.
'10': >-
  He who is overcome by dejection when valour is demanded—being bereft of
  splendour and energy—does not attain success in human endeavour.
'11': >-
  When that night had passed, Aṅgada, together with the Vānaras, meeting with
  the aged and senior monkeys, again deliberated counsel.
'12': >-
  That army of Vānaras, gathered round Aṅgada, shone forth—like the host of the
  Maruts standing around Vāsava (Indra).
'13': Who else could halt that monkey army—save the son of Vāli, and save Hanūmān?
'14': >-
  Then glorious Aṅgada, the tamer of foes, having shown due regard to those
  elder monkeys and to that army, spoke words full of meaning.
'15': >-
  “Who now, possessed of great splendour, will leap across the ocean? Who will
  accomplish (the purpose of) Sugrīva, true to his pledge and a subduer of
  enemies?”
'16': >-
  “What heroic monkey will leap a hundred yojanas? And who will deliver all
  these troop-leaders from this great peril?”
'17': >-
  “By whose favour shall we, turning back from here, behold again our wives, our
  sons, and our homes—our purpose fulfilled and ourselves happy?”
'18': >-
  “By whose favour shall we, rejoicing, go to Rāma and to mighty Lakṣmaṇa, and
  also to Sugrīva, the lord of the forest-dwellers?”
'19': >-
  “If there is among you any monkey capable of crossing the sea, let him here,
  without delay, grant us the holy gift—a boon in the form of fearlessness.”
'20': >-
  Hearing Aṅgada’s words, no one said anything at all. That entire monkey host
  there became as though motionless and silent.
'21': >-
  Again Aṅgada, the foremost of monkeys, addressed those monkeys: “All of you
  are the best among the strong, endowed with steadfast prowess; born in
  renowned lineages, and honoured repeatedly.”
'22': >-
  “Surely, for none of you should there ever be any failure in going. Declare, O
  bulls among monkeys, what strength each has for leaping.”
'23': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-fourth sarga, called “The Counsel concerning the Leaping
  across the Ocean,” in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primeval epic.
