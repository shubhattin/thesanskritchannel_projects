'0': >-
  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttara-kāṇḍa,
  begins the twelfth chapter called “The Marriages of Rāvaṇa and Others.”
'1': >-
  Now the lord of the rākṣasas, having been consecrated to sovereignty, and
  being then together with his brothers, thereafter resolved upon giving his
  rākṣasī sister in marriage.
'2': >-
  He gave his sister—the rākṣasī named Śūrpaṇakhā—to a Kālakaeya, to the lord of
  the dānavas named Vidyujjihva.
'3': >-
  Then, having bestowed her, that rākṣasa himself went ranging about in the
  forest for the sake of the hunt; and there, O Rāma, he beheld Maya by name,
  the son of Diti.
'4': >-
  Seeing him accompanied by a maiden, Daśagrīva, the night-ranger, asked him:
  “Who are you, alone in this manless forest filled with beasts? And for what
  reason do you remain together with this doe-eyed maiden?”
'5': >-
  Maya, O Rāma, spoke thus to that night-ranger who questioned him: “Listen; I
  shall declare to you everything—this whole matter of mine exactly as it
  occurred.”
'6': >-
  “There is an apsaras named Hemā, dear one—if you have heard of her before. She
  was given to me by the gods, as Paulomī was given to Śatakratu (Indra).”
'7': >-
  “With my mind bound in attachment to her, dear one, I lived for five hundred
  years; and she too—by reason of divine business—has been absent for thirteen
  years.”
'8': >-
  “Then, in the fourteenth year, I fashioned by my magic a city made of gold,
  variegated with vajra and vaiḍūrya gems.”
'9': “There I dwelt wretched, bereft of her, exceedingly sorrowful.”
'10': >-
  “Therefore, taking my daughter from that city, I came into the forest. This is
  my own daughter, O king, who was nurtured in her womb.”
'11': >-
  “Together with this girl I have come seeking her husband; for painful indeed
  is the state of being a maiden’s father for all who care for honor.”
'12': >-
  “For a daughter ever stands causing doubt in two families; and to me also, in
  that wife, two sons were born.”
'13': >-
  “Māyāvī was the first, dear one, and Dundubhi after him. Thus have I told you
  everything, truthfully, since you asked.”
'14': >-
  “But how, dear one, am I now to know who you are?” Thus addressed, that
  rākṣasa replied these courteous words:
'15': >-
  “I am the son of Paulastya, named Daśagrīva; and I am he who was born as the
  third—of the sage Viśravas—(a descendant) of Brahmā.”
'16': >-
  Thus spoken to, O Rāma, by the lord of rākṣasas, the dānava Maya—having
  recognized him as the son of the great ṛṣi—was filled with joy, and chose to
  give his daughter to him.
'17': >-
  Then Maya, taking the hand of his daughter into his own, smiling, spoke these
  words to the lord of rākṣasas:
'18': >-
  “This is my own daughter, O king, borne by the apsaras Hemā. Let this maiden
  named Mandodarī be accepted as your wife.”
'19': >-
  “So be it,” said Daśagrīva, O Rāma, in reply to him; and having kindled the
  sacred fire there, he performed the rite of taking her hand in marriage.
'20': >-
  For Maya, O Rāma, being aware of the curse of that sage rich in austerity, and
  knowing it, gave her to him—(considering) his lineage descended from the
  Grandsire (Brahmā).
'21': >-
  And he bestowed upon him an unfailing, most wondrous śakti-weapon, won by
  supreme austerity—by which he later slew Lakṣmaṇa.
'22': >-
  Thus, having taken a wife, the lord and ruler of Laṅkā went to his city and
  there brought wives also for his brothers.
'23': >-
  The granddaughter of Virocana, known by name as Vajrajvālā—her Rāvaṇa arranged
  as the wife of Kumbhakarṇa.
'24': >-
  And Vibhīṣaṇa obtained as his wife Saramā by name—righteous and knowing
  dharma—the daughter of the king of Gandharvas, the great-souled Śailūṣa.
'25': >-
  On the bank of a lake, indeed, she was born—of that lake called Mānas; and
  that lake, Mānas, then grew full at the coming of the rainy clouds.
'26': >-
  And her mother, out of affection, cried out these words regarding that girl:
  “O lake, do not swell!” From that, she came to be called Saramā.
'27': >-
  Thus, having taken wives, those rākṣasas sported there—each approaching his
  own wife—like Gandharvas in Nandana (Indra’s grove).
'28': >-
  Thereafter Mandodarī gave birth to a son, Meghānāda. He is the very one whom
  you call Indrajit.
'29': >-
  For formerly, at the very moment of his birth, that son of Rāvaṇa, weeping,
  let forth a mighty roar like the rumbling of a rain-cloud.
'30': >-
  And Laṅkā was benumbed, O Rāghava, by that cry; and his father himself gave
  him the name “Meghānāda.”
'31': >-
  He then grew up, O Rāma, within the auspicious inner palace of Rāvaṇa, guarded
  by excellent women—hidden like fire by logs.
'32': That son of Rāvaṇa brought great joy to his mother and father.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the twelfth chapter, called “The Marriages of Rāvaṇa and Others,” in
  the Uttara-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya.
