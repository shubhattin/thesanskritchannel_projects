  Now, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins the
  ninetieth canto, entitled “The Attainment of Manhood by Ilā.”
'1': >-
  When Rāma had thus spoken, then Lakṣmaṇa spoke again, and Bhārata also, the
  greatly renowned, (desiring to hear further) about that wondrous circumstance
  of his birth.
'2': >-
  “That Ilā, having dwelt with the son of Soma for a full year—what then did she
  do, O best of men? Thou art worthy to declare the truth (of it) to us.”
'3': >-
  Hearing the sweetness of their words as they thus inquired, Rāma once more
  related this account concerning Ilā, the daughter of Prajāpati.
'4': >-
  When the valiant one had regained manhood, Budha—exceedingly wise and of great
  renown—invited (to counsel) Saṃvarta, most magnanimous, (to come to him).
'5': >-
  (He invited) Cyavana, the son of Bhṛgu; and the sage Āriṣṭanemi; and
  Pramodana, the giver of delight; and then the sage Durvāsas.
'6': >-
  Having brought together all those (sages)—he who was skilled in speech and a
  seer of truth—addressed them all, his well-wishers, who were steadfast and
  composed with firmness.
'7': >-
  “This king, mighty-armed, is Ila, the son of Kardama. Know him in his true
  condition, as it really is; and let what is most beneficial herein be
  ordained.”
'8': >-
  While they were conversing thus, there came to that hermitage Kardama himself,
  of great splendour, together with noble-souled Brāhmaṇas.
'9': >-
  Pulastya and Kratu, and likewise Vaṣaṭkāra; and Oṃkāra too, of great
  radiance—(all) came to that hermitage.
'10': >-
  All of them, delighted at heart at meeting one another, and seeking the
  welfare of the lord of Bāhlī, spoke separately, each his own counsel.
'11': >-
  Then Kardama spoke words supremely beneficial, intent upon his son’s good: “O
  Brāhmaṇas, hear my words—those which are for the true welfare of this earthly
  king.”
'12': >-
  “I see no other remedy, apart from the Bull-bannered Lord (Śiva). Nor is there
  any sacrifice higher than the Aśvamedha, and it is dear to that great-souled
  One. Therefore let us all perform, for the king’s sake, that sacrifice which
  is hard of access (to accomplish).”
'13': >-
  Thus addressed by Kardama, all those foremost of twice-born sages approved
  that sacrifice, (seeing it as) leading to the propitiation of Rudra.
'14': >-
  Then Marutta, famed by that name—who was the disciple of the royal sage
  Saṃvarta, and (also) called Purapūrañjaya—made ready that sacrifice.
'15': >-
  Thereupon a mighty sacrifice was performed near Budha’s hermitage, and Rudra,
  of great renown, attained the highest satisfaction.
'16': >-
  Now, when the sacrifice had been completed, the Lord of Umā, pleased with
  exceeding joy, addressed all the Brāhmaṇas in Ilā’s presence.
'17': >-
  “I am pleased by the horse-sacrifice and by your devotion, O best of
  Brāhmaṇas. What auspicious boon, dear (to you), shall I do for this lord of
  Bāhlī?”
'18': >-
  As the Lord of the gods spoke thus, those Brāhmaṇas, well-composed, entreated
  the Lord of the gods in such wise that Ilā might become a man.
'19': >-
  Then the great Lord (Mahādeva), well-pleased, again bestowed manhood upon Ilā;
  and having granted that boon, the highly radiant One vanished from sight.
'20': >-
  When the horse-sacrifice had thus concluded and Hara had gone beyond sight,
  all those sages of far-seeing wisdom departed, each to his own abode.
'21': >-
  Then the king, leaving Bāhlī, established in the unsurpassed Madhyadeśa a city
  named Pratiṣṭhāna, a source of renown.
'22': >-
  And Śaśabindu, the royal sage, (and) Bāhlī Purapūrañjaya; and in Pratiṣṭhāna,
  King Ilā—mighty, the son of Prajāpati—(ruled there).
'23': >-
  In due time Ilā attained the unsurpassed Brahma-world; and Purūravā, the king,
  the son of Ilā (Aila), obtained Pratiṣṭhāna (as his realm).
'24': >-
  Such indeed is the power of the Aśvamedha, O best of men: one who had become a
  woman regained manhood, and obtained also what else is difficult to attain.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the ninetieth canto of the Uttarakāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Attainment of Manhood by Ilā.”
