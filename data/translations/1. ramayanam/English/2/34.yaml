  Now begins the thirty-fourth chapter of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Consolation (Attempted Consoling) of Daśaratha.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon Rāma—lotus‑petal‑eyed, dark‑hued, incomparable, and mighty—said to
  that charioteer: “Go and inform my father about me.”
'2': >-
  Dispatched by Rāma, the charioteer quickly entered the king’s presence and saw
  the ruler of men with senses clouded by grief, heaving deep sighs.
'3': >-
  He beheld the lord of the earth like the sun grown dim and ruddy, like fire
  covered with ashes, like a tank whose waters are drained away.
'4': >-
  Awakening that supremely wise king whose mind was utterly distraught, the
  charioteer, with joined palms, spoke—seeing him grieving for Rāma alone.
'5': >-
  First offering the king words of victory and benediction, the charioteer then
  spoke in a subdued, gentle voice, trembling with fear.
'6': >-
  “That tiger among men—your son—stands at the door, having given wealth to the
  brāhmaṇas and also to all who depend upon him for their livelihood.
'7': >-
  “May it be well with you—let Rāma, steadfast in truth and prowess, behold you.
  Having taken leave of all his friends, he now desires to see you.
'8': >-
  “He will depart for the great forest. Behold him, O lord of the
  earth—surrounded by every royal virtue, as the sun is surrounded by its rays.”
'9': >-
  Then the lord of men—truth‑speaking, righteous, ocean‑deep in gravity, and
  untainted like the sky—replied to him.
'10': >-
  “Sumantra, bring me the queens—whichever of my wives are here. Surrounded by
  all my consorts, I wish to see Rāghava.”
'11': >-
  Passing into the inner apartments, he spoke to those women: “The king, your
  noble lord, summons you. Go there at once; do not delay.”
'12': >-
  Thus addressed by Sumantra on the king’s command, all the women set about
  obeying their husband’s royal order and proceeded through that palace.
'13': >-
  There were three hundred and fifty women there, copper‑eyed maidens;
  surrounding Kausalyā, they went slowly, firm in resolve.
'14': >-
  When the queens had arrived and the lord of the earth had looked upon them,
  the king said to the charioteer: “Sumantra, bring my son to me.”
'15': >-
  Taking Rāma, along with Lakṣmaṇa and Maithilī Sītā, the charioteer swiftly
  went toward the presence of the lord of the earth.
'16': >-
  Seeing his son approaching from a distance with joined palms, the
  king—tormented and surrounded by the women—leapt up quickly from his seat.
'17': >-
  The lord of the people rushed forward in haste upon seeing Rāma; but on
  reaching him, stricken with sorrow, he fell to the ground in a faint.
'18': >-
  Rāma at once sprang toward him, and Lakṣmaṇa too, the great
  chariot‑warrior—toward the king, as though bereft of consciousness from grief,
  sunk in mourning.
'19': >-
  In the royal palace a cry arose from a thousand women at once—“Alas! Alas!
  Rāma!”—sudden and mingled with the clinking of ornaments.
'20': >-
  Embracing him with their arms, those two—Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa—placed him upon a
  couch, together with Sītā, all of them weeping.
'21': >-
  Then Rāma, when the king had regained consciousness after a short while, spoke
  with joined palms to the lord of the earth—who was overwhelmed as though
  submerged in an ocean of grief and tears.
'22': >-
  “I take leave of you, O great king; you are the sovereign over us all. As I
  set out for the Daṇḍaka forest, look upon me in well‑being.”
'23': >-
  “Also grant leave to Lakṣmaṇa; and let Sītā follow me to the forest—though we
  two have been restrained by many true reasons, and yet we do not wish to
  desist.”
'24': >-
  “Grant leave to all of us, O bestower of honor; casting away grief, permit
  Lakṣmaṇa, me, and Sītā—like Prajāpati his own children.”
'25': >-
  While Rāghava stood awaiting without agitation the lord of the earth’s
  permission, the king, gazing upon him, spoke regarding his dwelling in the
  forest.
'26': >-
  “O Rāghava, I—deluded by Kaikeyī through the granting of a boon—today in
  Ayodhyā, you yourself become king, holding me in check.”
'27': >-
  Thus addressed by the king, Rāma—best among the uphold­ers of dharma—replied,
  joining his palms, to his father, being skilled in speech.
'28': >-
  “May you, O king, be lord of the earth for a thousand years. I shall dwell in
  the forest; I have no desire for the kingdom.”
'29': >-
  “Having spent nine years and five more in forest‑dwelling, I shall again take
  hold of your feet at the end of my vow, O ruler of men.”
'30': >-
  Weeping in anguish, bound by the noose of truth, and urged on by Kaikeyī, the
  king spoke to him again and again.
'31': >-
  “For your welfare, your increase, and for your return, dear son—go forth
  unhurt and untroubled, on a path free from fear on every side.”
'32': >-
  “For one like you, dear son—true‑souled and intent on dharma—there is no
  possibility of turning back your resolve, O delight of the Raghu line.”
'33': >-
  “Yet today, this very night, my son, do not depart at all. Even for a single
  day, by merely seeing you, let me somehow continue to live so long.”
'34': >-
  “Having looked upon your mother and me, stay this night. Satisfied in every
  desire, you shall accomplish it tomorrow at dawn.”
'35': >-
  “A hard deed is being done, my son—entirely so, dear Rāghava—for you have thus
  taken refuge in the forest for my sake alone.”
'36': >-
  “And this is not pleasing to me, my son—I swear it by truth, O Rāghava. I have
  been shaken and driven from my course by a hidden woman, like fire covered
  with ashes.”
'37': >-
  “The deception that has befallen me—you wish to overcome it, being driven by
  Kaikeyī, who brings about the ruin of right conduct.”
'38': >-
  “And it is not the greatest wonder that you are my eldest son; but, my son,
  how can you wish to make your father one who speaks untruth?”
'39': >-
  Then Rāma, hearing these words of his afflicted father, spoke with downcast
  countenance, together with his brother Lakṣmaṇa.
'40': >-
  “The virtues I may gain today—who will grant them to me tomorrow? Therefore I
  choose departure itself, with all my aims secured thereby.”
'41': >-
  “This earth—together with the kingdom and its people, rich in wealth and
  grain—released by me, let it be given to Bharata.”
'42': >-
  “My resolve for forest‑dwelling has been made, and it shall not waver today.
  But that boon which you, giver of boons, granted to Kaikeyī in time of war—”
'43': >-
  “—let it be fulfilled in its entirety; be true to your word, O king. As for
  me, I shall follow your command exactly as spoken.”
'44': >-
  “For fourteen years I shall dwell in the forest along with the
  forest‑dwellers. Let there be no deliberation; let the earth be given to
  Bharata.”
'45': >-
  “For I desire neither the kingdom, nor any dear pleasure for myself. It is
  only to do as you command, O joy of the Raghu line.”
'46': >-
  “Let your sorrow depart; do not be drenched in tears. For the mighty,
  unassailable ocean—the lord of rivers—does not become turbulent.”
'47': >-
  “I desire neither sovereignty, nor pleasure, nor the earth; nor indeed all
  these enjoyments—nor heaven, nor even life.”
'48': >-
  “I desire that you be true, not false, O bull among men. I swear it openly by
  your truthfulness and by your merit.”
'49': >-
  “I am not able, dear father, to remain even for a moment, O lord. Bear this
  grief—there is no change of mind in me.”
'50': >-
  “For Kaikeyī has petitioned me: ‘Go to the forest,’ O Rāghava; and I have
  said, ‘I shall go.’ That truth I will uphold.”
'51': >-
  “And do not, O divine king, feel yearning for us; we shall take delight in the
  forest—where herds of deer are tranquil, and where many birds call aloud.”
'52': >-
  “A father, dear sir, is remembered as a deity—even among the gods. Therefore,
  regarding it as a divine command, I shall carry out my father’s word.”
'53': >-
  “When fourteen years have passed, O best of kings, you shall see me returned.
  Let this anguish be set aside.”
'54': >-
  “You are the one who should steady this entire people, whose voices are broken
  by tears. Why then, O tiger among men, have you fallen into such alteration
  (of composure)?”
'55': >-
  “This city, this realm, and this land alone—released by me—let it be given to
  Bharata. Obeying your command, I shall go to the forest to dwell there for
  long in service (of my vow).”
'56': >-
  “Let Bharata rule this land that I have relinquished—with its mountain tracts,
  with its cities and suburbs and groves. Let him govern it solely within
  auspicious boundaries. O king, let it be exactly as you have spoken.”
'57': >-
  “My mind does not incline, O sovereign, toward great desires, nor toward what
  is pleasing to myself, as much as it inclines toward your command—approved by
  the good and disciplined. Let your sorrow, on my account, depart, O sinless
  one.”
'58': >-
  “Therefore today, O blameless king, I choose not imperishable kingship, nor
  all pleasures, nor the earth, nor Maithilī; nor would I yoke you to untruth.
  Let your vow be truth—so indeed let it be.”
'59': >-
  “Eating fruits and roots in the forest, beholding mountains, rivers, and
  lakes, and entering that woodland of varied trees, I shall be happy. May you
  attain peace and contentment.”
'60': >-
  Thus that king, fallen into calamity and oppressed by burning anguish and
  grief, embraced his son; his consciousness utterly failing, he sank to the
  ground and did not stir at all.
'61': >-
  All the queens wept together—except the wife of the god‑like king (Kaikeyī).
  Even Sumantra, weeping, fell into a swoon; everywhere there arose only cries
  of “Alas! Alas!”
'62': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fourth chapter of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa in the sacred
  Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Consolation of
  Daśaratha.”
