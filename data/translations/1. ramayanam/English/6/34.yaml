  Now begins the thirty-fourth sarga in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Declaration of Rāvaṇa’s Resolve.”
'1': >-
  Then Saramā comforted that Sītā, who had been made sorrowful and deluded by
  his words, as though sprinkling water upon earth that has been scorched by
  fire.
'2': >-
  Thereafter, that friend, wishing to do what was beneficial for her companion,
  spoke timely words—she who understood what was fitting to the moment, and who
  addressed her with a smile before she spoke.
'3': >-
  “I am able to go, O dark-eyed lady, and convey your message to Rāma, informing
  him of your welfare, and—remaining concealed—return again.”
'4': >-
  “For as I move through the supportless sky, neither the Wind-god nor even
  Garuḍa would be able to follow my course or match my path.”
'5': >-
  As she spoke thus, Sītā said this to Saramā, in a sweet and gentle voice—she
  who had earlier been overcome by grief.
'6': >-
  “You are indeed capable of going through the heavens, and even of descending
  to Rasātala. Therefore understand today what must be done—what you ought to do
  on my behalf.”
'7': >-
  “If you are to do what is dear to me, if your resolve is firm, then I wish to
  know—going there—what Rāvaṇa is doing and what he intends.”
'8': >-
  “For that Rāvaṇa, cruel and mighty in illusion—Rāvaṇa who is the foe that
  makes others cry—bewilders me, that wicked-souled one, as though I were one
  who has merely drunk wine.”
'9': >-
  “He constantly has me threatened, and again and again has me reviled; and by
  exceedingly dreadful rākṣasī-women he keeps me guarded at all times.”
'10': >-
  “I am anxious and fearful, and my mind is not at ease. From fear of him,
  agitated as I am, I have come to this Aśoka grove.”
'11': >-
  “If indeed there is any talk of his—whatever has been resolved by him—then
  report all of that. That would be a boon to me; it would be your favor.”
'12': >-
  Thus addressed, gentle-speaking Saramā said to Sītā, touching her face that
  was shaken with tears.
'13': >-
  “If this is your intention, then I shall go, O Jānakī. Having grasped the
  enemy’s purpose, I shall return, O princess of Mithilā.”
'14': >-
  Having said so, she went then to the vicinity of that rākṣasa, and heard what
  was being spoken by Rāvaṇa together with his counselors.
'15': >-
  Hearing the decision of that wicked one, and herself understanding decisions,
  she quickly came back again to the auspicious Aśoka grove.
'16': >-
  Entering there, she beheld the daughter of Janaka waiting for her lord, like
  Fortune herself with her lotus-seat lost.
'17': >-
  And Sītā, on Saramā’s return—she of pleasing speech—embraced her warmly with
  great affection, and herself offered her a seat.
'18': >-
  “Seated here at ease, tell me truly everything—the settled intention of that
  cruel, wicked-souled Rāvaṇa.”
'19': >-
  Thus spoken to by Sītā, who was trembling, Saramā then related in full all
  that had been spoken by Rāvaṇa among his counselors.
'20': >-
  “O Vaidehī, the lord of the rākṣasas was urged by his mother, and by an aged
  minister devoted to you with great affection, with many weighty words, for the
  sake of your release.”
'21': >-
  “‘Let Maithilī be given back with honor to the king of men. The proof shown to
  you at Janasthāna—so wondrous—ought to be sufficient.’”
'22': >-
  “‘And the crossing of the ocean, and the sight of Hanumān, and the slaying of
  the rākṣasas in battle—what human being could accomplish such deeds in war?’”
'23': >-
  “Though thus instructed much by his mother and by elder counselors, he still
  does not bring himself to release you, being intent upon his own advantage, as
  one who is wholly given to self-interest.”
'24': >-
  “He does not bring himself to release you, O Maithilī, even as one who is as
  good as dead; such indeed is the decision that stands firm in that cruel one,
  even though he is surrounded by ministers.”
'25': >-
  “This resolve of his is exceedingly steadfast, arising from greed for life.
  Out of fear, he is not able to release you—he who has not been cast down in
  battle.”
'26': >-
  “But after slaying Rāvaṇa in the fight, and indeed killing all the rākṣasas as
  well, with keen, sharp arrows in every way, Rāma will surely bring you back to
  Ayodhyā, O dark-eyed lady.”
'27': >-
  In the meanwhile, a sound filled with drums and conches was heard, shaking the
  surface of the earth, belonging to all the armies.
'28': >-
  But hearing that roar of the vānaras, the servants of the rākṣasa-king within
  Laṅkā—bereft of valor, their movements overwhelmed by dejection—see no way to
  what is best, because of their king’s fault.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fourth sarga in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable,
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Declaration
  of Rāvaṇa’s Resolve.”
