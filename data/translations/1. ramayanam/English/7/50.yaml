  Now begins the fiftieth canto in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Narration of Sumantra’s Secret.”
'1': >-
  But when Lakṣmaṇa saw Maithilī Sītā entering the hermitage, his heart sank;
  grievous anguish seized him, and he became utterly dejected in spirit.
'2': >-
  And the mighty and radiant Lakṣmaṇa spoke to Sumantra, the counsellor and
  charioteer: “O charioteer of Rāma, behold this sorrow born of Sītā’s
  distress.”
'3': >-
  What suffering, indeed, could be more terrible for Rāghava than this—that he
  has sent away the daughter of Janaka, a wife of stainless conduct and pure
  report?
'4': >-
  Plainly, O charioteer, I deem this to be the working of destiny; without
  destiny, such a state could not befall Rāghava. For destiny is ever with
  Vaidehī, and destiny indeed is hard to overstep.
'5': >-
  He who, when enraged, could slay even the gods together with the Gandharvas,
  and the Asuras along with the Rākṣasas—that Rāghava nevertheless follows the
  course ordained by fate.
'6': >-
  Formerly, by his father’s command, Rāma dwelt in the lonely forest of
  Daṇḍaka—nine years and five besides—in that vast wilderness.
'7': >-
  Yet a sorrow still more grievous than that is this banishment and separation
  of Sītā. Hearing the cruel words of the townsmen, it appears to me most
  inhuman.
'8': >-
  O charioteer, what refuge in dharma is there in this deed that brings
  disgrace—after Maithilī has been brought back—when it is driven by townsmen
  who are devoid of true meaning and speak empty, senseless arguments?
'9': >-
  Having heard these many kinds of words spoken by Lakṣmaṇa, wise Sumantra, with
  reverent attention, spoke these words in reply.
'10': >-
  “You should not give way to anguish, O Saumitrī, with regard to Maithilī. This
  was long ago foreseen by the Brahman seers, before your father and in your
  very presence, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'11': >-
  “Rāma will assuredly become one whose life is filled with sorrow, yet he will
  also partake of happiness; and that mighty-armed one will certainly undergo
  separation from those dear to him.”
'12': >-
  “In the course of great time, that great-souled, righteous Rāma will renounce
  you and Maithilī as well, and also Bharata and Śatrughna—both of them.”
'13': >-
  “This must not be spoken by you, O Saumitrī, nor by Bharata either—these are
  words that were uttered to you by the king, words spoken by the sage
  Durvāsas.”
'14': >-
  “In the presence of many people, and in my presence too, O bull among men,
  those words were pronounced by the ṛṣi, and that in the very presence of
  Vasiṣṭha.”
'15': >-
  “After hearing the ṛṣi’s statement, that foremost of men said to me: ‘O
  charioteer, at no time should you speak of this in the assembly of people.’”
'16': >-
  “Therefore, keeping well composed, I have held firmly to that word of the lord
  and protector of the world: ‘Never, at any time, is falsehood to be
  spoken’—such is my gentle understanding.”
'17': >-
  “In every way, O gentle one, I ought not to speak it—especially before you.
  Yet if you have faith to hear, then listen, O delight of the Raghu line.”
'18': >-
  “Although I was formerly made to hear this secret by the king, still I shall
  relate it—for destiny indeed is hard to overpass.”
'19': >-
  “It is by this that such sorrow, fraught with grief, has come to pass. Yet you
  must not speak of it to Bharata, nor in the presence of Śatrughna either.”
'20': >-
  Hearing that deep and weighty speech of Sumantra, rich with solemn meaning,
  Saumitrī then addressed the charioteer, saying: “Speak the truth to me.”
'21': >-
  Thus ends the fiftieth canto, entitled “The Narration of Sumantra’s Secret,”
  in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
