'0': >-
  Now begins, in the holy Valmiki Ramayana, in the Ayodhya-kanda, the
  fifty-second canto, called “The Crossing of the Ganga.”
'1': >-
  But when the night had passed and dawn had broken, the illustrious Rama, of
  broad-chested strength, spoke to Saumitri Lakshmana, whose auspicious marks
  betokened good fortune:
'2': >-
  “This is the hour of the Sun’s rising; the blessed night has departed. See,
  dear brother—the dark-hued bird, the cuckoo, is calling and cooing.”
'3': >-
  “And in the forest the loud cries of peacocks are heard as they trumpet. Come,
  gentle one—let us cross the Jahnavi, swift-flowing and making her way to the
  ocean; let us go.”
'4': >-
  Understanding Rama’s words, Saumitri—delighter of friends—after inviting Guha
  and the charioteer, took his place before his elder brother.
'5': >-
  Hearing Rama’s command and accepting it, Guha, the chief and master of
  arrangements, quickly summoned his ministers and spoke these words:
'6': >-
  “Bring at once a fair, well-equipped boat, fitted with oars and
  rudder-handles, easy to embark and strong—firm for crossing at this ford.”
'7': >-
  Hearing that order, Guha’s great band of attendants brought up a pleasing boat
  and reported back to Guha.
'8': >-
  Then Guha, with palms joined, said to Raghava, “O lord, the boat is ready.
  What more shall I do for you?”
'9': >-
  “For you—like a son of the immortals—to cross this river that runs to the sea,
  this boat is prepared. O tiger among men, do you, of excellent vows, ascend
  it.”
'10': >-
  Then the great and radiant Rama spoke to Guha these words: “By you I have been
  fully served. Let it be embarked upon without delay.”
'11': >-
  Then the two bowmen, binding on their swords and making ready their weapons,
  went to the Ganga—those two Raghavas—together with Sita.
'12': >-
  Approaching Rama, the knower of dharma, with humility, the charioteer said
  with joined palms, “What shall I do?”
'13': >-
  Then the son of Dasharatha said to Sumantra, touching him with his excellent
  right hand: “Sumantra, go back again quickly; be near the king, and be ever
  vigilant.”
'14': >-
  “Return,” he said to him; “so much alone has been done for me. Leaving the
  chariot behind, I shall go on foot to the great forest.”
'15': >-
  Seeing himself thus dismissed, the charioteer, distressed, spoke to the tiger
  among men, the Ikshvaku prince, these words:
'16': >-
  “This has never been surpassed in the world by any man: that you, with your
  brother and your wife, should dwell in the forest like common folk.”
'17': >-
  “I do not think there is any fruit arising from brahmacarya, nor from sacred
  study, nor from gentleness and straightforwardness, if such calamity has
  befallen you.”
'18': >-
  “Dwelling in the forest with Vaidehi and with your brother, O hero, you shall
  attain the highest course, as though conquering the three worlds.”
'19': >-
  “We indeed are ruined, Rama—those of us who have been deceived by her; we
  shall fall under the sway of sinful Kaikeyi, and become partakers of sorrow.”
'20': >-
  Thus speaking, the charioteer Sumantra—his grief equal to Rama’s—beheld Rama
  already gone far away, and, afflicted with sorrow, wept long.
'21': >-
  Then, when his tears had ceased, the charioteer, having touched pure water in
  purification, Rama again and again spoke to him in gentle words:
'22': >-
  “I do not perceive among the Ikshvakus a friend equal to you. Act in such a
  way that King Dasharatha may not grieve for me.”
'23': >-
  “The lord of the earth is old, his mind struck down by sorrow, and he is
  weighed down by the burden of desire; therefore I say this to you.”
'24': >-
  “Whatever that great-souled king, the lord of the land, may command—do it
  without hesitation, for the sake of pleasing Kaikeyi.”
'25': >-
  “Indeed, it is for this purpose that kings rule kingdoms: that in all their
  duties their mind may not be thwarted.”
'26': >-
  “And just as that great king does not fall into falsehood, and does not sink
  under grief—so do you act, Sumantra.”
'27': >-
  “When you have saluted the noble king—aged, self-restrained, and one who has
  not known suffering—speak to him, for my sake, these words.”
'28': >-
  “Neither I, nor Lakshmana, nor Maithili lament that we have fallen from
  Ayodhya, or that we must live in the forest.”
'29': >-
  “When the full fourteen years are completed, you shall soon see Lakshmana, me,
  and Sita returned again.”
'30': >-
  “Having thus spoken to the king, and to my mother, and to the other queens
  together with Kaikeyi—again and again—”
'31': >-
  “Convey health to Kausalya, and make obeisance at her feet, in accordance with
  the words of Sita, of me, of the noble Lakshmana.”
'32': >-
  “And tell the great king: ‘Bring Bharata back quickly.’ And when Bharata
  arrives, he must be installed in the position intended by the king.”
'33': >-
  “Embracing Bharata and consecrating him in the crown-princeship, the grief
  born of our distress will not overpower you.”
'34': >-
  “Bharata too must be told: ‘As you behave toward the king, so should you
  behave toward all the mothers, without distinction.’”
'35': >-
  “And as Kaikeyi and Sumitra are to you without distinction, so also should
  Queen Kausalya be—she being especially my mother.”
'36': >-
  “Seeking the crown-princeship out of desire to please your father, it will be
  possible for you to promote the welfare and happiness of both the worlds.”
'37': >-
  Thus restrained by Rama, Sumantra—worn away by grief—having heard all those
  words, spoke to Kakutstha out of affection:
'38': >-
  “If, out of affection, without agitation, I have spoken in a way not befitting
  due formality, then you ought to pardon those words, for I am devoted.”
'39': >-
  “How shall I return to that city bereft of you—like one shaken by a son’s
  grief because of separation from his father?”
'40': >-
  “Even when the people see my chariot with Rama, it is thus; but seeing the
  chariot without Rama, that city itself would break apart.”
'41': >-
  “The city will surely sink into wretchedness on seeing this chariot empty—like
  an army left with only its charioteer, its hero slain in battle.”
'42': >-
  “Though you dwell far away, you stand foremost in the minds of the people;
  thinking of you today, surely the subjects have become without food.”
'43': >-
  “For you yourself saw, Rama, at the time of your departure, the confused
  condition of the citizens—minds exhausted by grief for you.”
'44': >-
  “The cry of anguish the townsmen uttered at your leaving—on merely seeing me
  seated in the chariot—would become a hundredfold greater than that.”
'45': >-
  “What, indeed, shall I say to your mother? ‘Your son has been taken by me to
  the house of his maternal uncle; do not grieve’—”
'46': >-
  “I would not speak such words, even if they were untrue; and yet how shall I
  speak this truth, which is only painful?”
'47': >-
  “Those excellent horses—belonging to your kinsmen and your people, and
  standing under my charge—how will they endure to be spoken of as being without
  you and without the chariot?”
'48': >-
  “I shall not be able to go to Ayodhya without you, O sinless one. You ought to
  grant me leave to follow you into forest-dwelling.”
'49': >-
  “If, though I beg you, you will only abandon me, then, still with my chariot,
  I shall enter fire—cast off by you here.”
'50': >-
  “Whatever beings there may be in the forest that would create obstacles to
  your austerities, O Raghava—by the chariot I shall ward them off.”
'51': >-
  “By serving as a charioteer I have gained the comfort of chariot-travel; I
  hope, by serving you, to gain the comfort born of forest-dwelling.”
'52': >-
  “Be gracious: I desire to be your close attendant in the wilderness. In
  affection I beg you—let me be ever at your side.”
'53': >-
  “And these horses too, O hero—if they are to dwell with you in the forest and
  render service—shall attain the highest state.”
'54': >-
  “Dwelling in the forest, I shall render service to you with bowed head. I
  abandon Ayodhya—or even heaven—entirely.”
'55': >-
  “For I cannot enter Ayodhya without you, any more than by evil deeds one can
  enter the great Indra’s capital.”
'56': >-
  “When the forest-dwelling is ended, this is my heart’s desire: that with this
  very chariot I might bear you back to the city again.”
'57': >-
  “Indeed, fourteen years in the forest together with you will pass like a
  moment; but without you they would pass by the hundreds—endlessly long.”
'58': >-
  “You ought not to abandon me—your devoted servant—who stands loving servants,
  when master and son have set out upon the road.”
'59': >-
  When he had repeatedly begged in many piteous ways, Rama—compassionate to his
  servant—said this to Sumantra:
'60': >-
  “I know your supreme devotion toward me, you who are affectionate to your
  master. Hear also the reason for which I send you back to the city from here.”
'61': >-
  “Seeing you return to the city, my younger mother, Kaikeyi, would be assured:
  ‘Rama has indeed gone to the forest.’”
'62': >-
  “For, O lady, when I have gone to forest-dwelling, she will be satisfied; and
  she will not suspect the righteous king as a liar.”
'63': >-
  “This indeed is my first intention: that my younger mother may obtain for
  Bharata a prosperous kingdom, safeguarded.”
'64': >-
  “For my sake and for the king’s sake, go to the city with your chariot; and
  whatever instructions you have been given, speak them—each one—just so.”
'65': >-
  Having spoken thus to the charioteer, consoling him again and again, Rama then
  addressed Guha in fearless, reasoned words:
'66': >-
  “Now, Guha, this dwelling of mine is not fit to be amid people in the forest.
  I must necessarily dwell in an ashrama; that is the proper rule for one who
  has gone there.”
'67': >-
  “Therefore, having undertaken the observance that is the ornament of ascetics,
  desiring the welfare of my father again, and of Sita and Lakshmana—”
'68': >-
  “I shall fashion matted locks. Bring the milk of the banyan tree.” Then Guha
  quickly brought that milk for the prince.
'69': >-
  With that, Rama made matted locks for Lakshmana and for himself. The
  long-armed tiger among men assumed the state of wearing matted hair.
'70': >-
  Then those two brothers—Rama and Lakshmana—clad in bark garments and bearing
  circles of matted locks, shone like two rishis.
'71': >-
  Then, having taken to the path of the Vaikhanasa ascetics together with
  Lakshmana, Rama—having taken up the vowed observance—spoke to Guha, his
  companion:
'72': >-
  “Be vigilant concerning your forces, your treasury, your fortifications, and
  your countryside. For a kingdom, in my view, is exceedingly hard to guard.”
'73': >-
  Having thus granted him leave, the delight of the Ikshvakus went swiftly and
  without distraction—together with his wife and with Lakshmana.
'74': >-
  Seeing the boat at the riverbank, the Ikshvaku prince, desiring to cross the
  swift-flowing Ganga, said this to Lakshmana:
'75': >-
  “Ascend this boat, O tiger among men, which stands ready, gently and
  carefully; and then place Sita on board after you, supporting that
  noble-minded lady.”
'76': >-
  Hearing his brother’s command and opposing nothing, he first embarked
  Maithili, and thereafter the self-possessed Lakshmana embarked.
'77': >-
  Then the radiant Rama—elder brother of Lakshmana—himself embarked; and then
  Guha, the lord of the Nishadas, urged on his kinsmen.
'78': >-
  Raghava too, of great splendor, having boarded that boat, uttered for his own
  welfare sacred recitation, in a manner befitting both brahman and kshatra.
'79': >-
  And having sipped water according to ordinance, together with Sita, Lakshmana
  too—of immeasurable radiance—bowed to that river, delighted and thrilled with
  devotion.
'80': >-
  After taking leave of Sumantra, and of Guha together with his forces, Rama,
  embarking on the boat, set the boatmen to their task.
'81': >-
  Then, urged on by them, that boat—well-handled by those at the stern—struck by
  the speed of the favorable current, quickly cut across the waters.
'82': >-
  But when they reached the middle of the Bhagirathi, blameless Vaidehi, with
  joined palms, spoke to that river these words:
'83': >-
  “This is the son of the wise great king Dasharatha. O Ganga, let him fulfill
  this command, protected by you.”
'84': >-
  “For fourteen full years, dwelling in the woodland with his brother and with
  me, he will return again.”
'85': >-
  “Then, O goddess, O auspicious one, I—returned in safety—shall worship you
  with gladness, O Ganga, for the fulfillment of all desires.”
'86': >-
  “For you, O goddess, are Tripathaga, flowing in three paths and beholding
  Brahma’s world; and in this world you are seen as the consort of the
  ocean-king.”
'87': >-
  “Therefore I bow to you, O goddess; I praise you, O splendid one—when the
  tiger among men has regained his kingdom and has returned again in
  auspiciousness.”
'88': >-
  “A hundred thousand cows, garments, and excellent food shall I give to
  brahmanas, wishing to do what is dear to you.”
'89': >-
  “With a thousand pots of sura, and with rice cooked with meat, I shall worship
  you, O goddess, in purity, when I have returned to the city once more.”
'90': >-
  “And whatever deities dwell upon your banks, all of them shall I worship—and
  the sacred fords and their shrines as well.”
'91': >-
  “And may the long-armed, sinless one—reunited with me and with his
  brother—enter Ayodhya again after the forest-dwelling, O sinless lady.”
'92': >-
  Thus speaking to Ganga, blameless Sita quickly drew near the southern bank on
  the right-hand side.
'93': >-
  Having reached the bank and leaving the boat, the bull among men set forth,
  with his brother and with Vaidehi, for the supreme austerity of forest-life.
'94': >-
  Then the mighty-armed Rama spoke to the increaser of Sumitra’s joy: “Be
  watchful for protection—whether among people or in lonely places.”
'95': >-
  “Protection must surely be maintained in the unseen, solitary forest. Go in
  front, Saumitri; let Sita follow behind you.”
'96': >-
  “I shall go behind, guarding both you and Sita. Today Vaidehi will truly come
  to know the hardship of forest-dwelling.”
'97': >-
  “For until now no undertaking has passed beyond what is easy; but today
  Vaidehi will truly come to know the hardship of forest-dwelling.”
'98': >-
  “Today she will enter a forest emptied of human throngs, devoid of fields and
  pleasure-groves—uneven, and with ravines and precipitous falls.”
'99': >-
  Hearing Rama’s words, Lakshmana set out in front; and immediately behind Sita
  went Raghava, the delight of the Raghus.
'100': >-
  But when Rama had swiftly reached the farther bank of the Ganga, Sumantra,
  continually gazing upon him, at length turned away his eyes through the strain
  of the road; tormented like an ascetic, he let fall his tears.
'101': >-
  That great-souled one, whose power was like that of the guardians of the
  worlds, having crossed that mighty river—giver of boons—then, in due course,
  came upon prosperous, fair, well-cropped calf-pastures, and rejoiced.
'102': >-
  There they slew four great beasts—a boar, a rishya-deer, a spotted antelope,
  and a great ruru—and taking the pure flesh, hungry and in haste, they went in
  season to find lodging with the lord of the forest.
'103': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-second canto, called “The Crossing of the Ganga,” in the
  Ayodhya-kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the first epic.
