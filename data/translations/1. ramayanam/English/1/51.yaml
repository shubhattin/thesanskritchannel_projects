  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bāla-kāṇḍa, begins
  the fifty-first canto, entitled “The Account of Viśvāmitra’s History.”
'1': >-
  Having heard those words of the sagacious Viśvāmitra, Śatānanda—of delighted
  countenance, of great splendour, and of mighty austerities—became filled with
  joy.
'2': >-
  Śatānanda, the eldest son of Gautama, whose radiance was kindled by
  asceticism, was seized with the utmost wonder merely upon beholding Rāma.
'3': >-
  Seeing those two princes, the sons of the king, seated there at ease,
  Śatānanda then addressed Viśvāmitra, the foremost of sages:
'4': >-
  “O tiger among ascetics, has my illustrious mother—who has long engaged in
  austerities—been shown to the prince?”
'5': >-
  “O great-souled one, has my renowned mother offered worship to mighty Rāma
  with forest produce—he who is worthy of worship by all embodied beings?”
'6': >-
  “Has that ancient account been told to Rāma—namely, the mighty exploit of my
  mother, which was difficult even for a god to accomplish?”
'7': >-
  “O son of Kuśika, be it well with you—has my mother, accompanied by my revered
  teacher, approached Rāma from the moment she beheld him?”
'8': >-
  “O Kuśika’s son, has Rāma—of great splendour—been honoured by my teacher,
  having come here and received due worship from the great-souled one?”
'9': >-
  “O son of Kuśika, has my teacher, with a tranquil mind, been honoured and
  respectfully saluted by Rāma upon his arrival here?”
'10': >-
  Hearing Śatānanda’s speech, the great sage Viśvāmitra—skilled in words and
  discerning in their meaning—replied to him, who likewise was eloquent and wise
  in speech:
'11': >-
  “O best of sages, I have not gone beyond what was to be done; what ought to be
  done has been done by me. Your mother has met with the sage—just as Reṇukā met
  with Bhṛgu.”
'12': >-
  Having heard those words of the wise Viśvāmitra, Śatānanda—of great
  splendour—then spoke these words to Rāma:
'13': >-
  “Welcome to you, O best of men. By good fortune you have come, O Rāghava,
  having Viśvāmitra—the unconquered great seer—as your guide and leader.”
'14': >-
  “By austerity he has become a Brahmarṣi, of inconceivable deeds and
  immeasurable radiance. This mighty Viśvāmitra—I know his supreme attainment.”
'15': >-
  “None in the world, O Rāma, is more fortunate than you; for the son of Kuśika
  has protected you—he by whom a great austerity was performed.”
'16': >-
  “Hear, and I shall declare to you the story of the great-souled Kauśika
  (Viśvāmitra). Listen to me as I relate it—according to my ability and
  according to the truth of it.”
'17': >-
  “There was a king, righteous in soul, for a long time a subduer of
  foes—knowing dharma, accomplished in learning, and devoted to the welfare of
  his subjects.”
'18': >-
  “He was Kuśa by name, a lord of the earth, a son of Prajāpati. Kuśa’s son was
  the mighty Kuśanābha, well established in dharma.”
'19': >-
  “Kuśanābha’s son was famed by the name Gādhi; and Gādhi’s son was the great
  sage Viśvāmitra, of mighty splendour.”
'20': >-
  “That Viśvāmitra, of great splendour, protected the earth; for many thousands
  of years, as king, he administered the kingdom.”
'21': >-
  “And on one occasion, the mighty one, having arrayed his army, and surrounded
  by an akṣauhiṇī host, went about the earth on a royal circuit.”
'22': >-
  “Traversing in order cities and provinces, rivers and great mountains, the
  king came, in his wanderings, to hermitages.”
'23': >-
  “He came to the hermitage-site of Vasiṣṭha—adorned with trees and creepers
  bearing blossoms of many kinds, and filled with herds of diverse animals;
  attended by Siddhas and Cāraṇas.”
'24': >-
  “It was made splendid by Devas, Dānavas, Gandharvas, and Kiṃnaras; thronged
  with gentle, peaceful deer, and frequented by assemblies of twice-born sages.”
'25': >-
  “It was crowded with hosts of Brahmarṣis and resorted to by hosts of Devarṣis;
  and by great-souled ascetics, perfected through the practice of tapas, blazing
  like fire.”
'26': >-
  “Ever thronged and illustrious with great souls like Brahmā himself—some
  living on water alone, some on air alone, and others subsisting on withered
  leaves likewise.”
'27': >-
  “It was adorned by self-controlled sages living on fruits and roots—subduers
  of faults, conquerors of the senses—and by Vālakhilya Ṛṣis devoted to muttered
  prayer and sacrificial oblations.”
'28': >-
  “And it was beautified all around by other Vaikhānasa sages as well. That
  hermitage of Vasiṣṭha, like another Brahma-loka, the mighty
  Viśvāmitra—foremost among the victorious—beheld.”
'29': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-first canto of the Bāla-kāṇḍa in the sacred, illustrious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki—the first epic—entitled “The Account of Viśvāmitra’s
  History.”
