  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifth canto called “Rāma’s Lament in Separation.”
'1': >-
  But that army, duly protected by Nīla and well-composed, was properly and
  securely encamped on the northern shore of the ocean.
'2': >-
  And there, the two foremost of monkeys—Mainda and Dvivida—moved about that
  host in every direction, for the sake of guarding it.
'3': >-
  Now, when the army had taken its position on the shore of the lord of rivers
  and streams, Rāma, seeing Lakṣmaṇa standing close by his side, spoke these
  words.
'4': >-
  “Sorrow indeed, as time passes, is said to pass away; yet for me, who do not
  behold my beloved, it increases day after day.
'5': >-
  It is not that I grieve because my beloved is far away, nor that I grieve
  because she has been carried off; this alone is what I mourn—that her youth is
  passing away.
'6': >-
  ‘Blow, O wind, from where my beloved is; having touched her, touch me also. In
  you there is contact with her limbs, and in the moon there is union of sight.’
'7': >-
  That burns my limbs, as though poison were drunk and lodged within me—when my
  dear one, being carried away, cried to me, ‘Ah, my lord!’
'8': >-
  Because of that separation—abounding as it were in fuel—and with that thought
  as its bright, pure flame, my body is scorched night and day by the fire of
  desire.
'9': >-
  “I shall plunge into the ocean and sleep, O Saumitri, without you; thus,
  desire blazing in this manner may not burn me, even while I lie asleep in the
  waters.
'10': >-
  So much is this longing; by this alone it is possible to go on living—namely,
  that I and that fair-thighed one still rest upon the same single earth.
'11': >-
  As a field without a field, as water with no water, so do I live by mere
  nearness—by the thought that she lives, so long as I hear that she is alive.
'12': >-
  When indeed shall I, having conquered the enemies, behold Sītā—the fair-hipped
  one with lotus-petal-like eyes—like prosperity in her fullness?
'13': >-
  When shall I gently raise and behold her lotus-like face, with teeth and lips
  of exquisite beauty, like a sick man looking upon a life-giving elixir?
'14': >-
  Those two full breasts of hers, close together, like the fruit of the tāla
  palm—when shall they, trembling, come to be mine as she embraces me?
'15': >-
  Surely that dark-cornered-eyed lady, fallen into the midst of the rākṣasas,
  being devoted to me as her lord, finds no protector—like one bereft of a lord.
'16': >-
  How is it that the daughter of King Janaka, my beloved—also the
  daughter-in-law of Daśaratha—lies amid rākṣasīs?
'17': >-
  Shaking off the rākṣasas without being disturbed, she will rise up—like the
  streak of the moon in autumn, shaking off dark rain-clouds.
'18': >-
  Delicate by nature, surely, and by grief and by fasting as well, Sītā has
  become even more slender, because of the perversion of place and time.
'19': >-
  When shall I, placing my arrows upon the chest of the lord of rākṣasas, drive
  away my grief, casting sorrow out of my mind?
'20': >-
  When indeed shall my virtuous Sītā—like the daughter of the gods—eagerly clasp
  my neck and let fall tears born of joy?
'21': >-
  When shall I suddenly cast off this dreadful grief, born from separation from
  Maithilī, as one casts aside a soiled garment for a white one?
'22': >-
  As he, the wise Rāma, lamented thus there, at the waning of the day the sun,
  with enfeebled radiance, went down to the western horizon.
'23': >-
  Comforted by Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma performed the evening worship, remembering Sītā of
  lotus-petal eyes, and was overwhelmed by grief.
'24': >-
  Thus ends the fifth canto, named “Rāma’s Lament in Separation,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
