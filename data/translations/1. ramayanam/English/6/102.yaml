  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa,
  begins the two-hundred-and-second canto, named “The Reviving of Lakṣmaṇa.”
'1': >-
  When Rāma beheld Lakṣmaṇa—heroic in battle—struck down by the mighty Rāvaṇa,
  fallen in the combat and drenched in torrents of blood,
'2': >-
  after offering fierce battle to that wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, and still releasing
  a continuous shower of arrows, he spoke these words to Suṣeṇa:
'3': >-
  “By the prowess of Rāvaṇa, this Lakṣmaṇa has fallen upon the earth. That
  warrior writhes like a serpent, stirring up my grief.
'4': >-
  This hero, soaked in blood, is dearer to me than my own life-breaths. While I
  look on, what power have I to fight, when my very self is bewildered?
'5': >-
  This very one—my brother of auspicious marks, famed in battle—if he has come
  to the state of death, then what is comfort to me, and what are my own
  life-breaths?
'6': >-
  My valor, as it were, is ashamed; the bow, as it were, slips from my hand. My
  arrows fail; my sight is overcome by tears.
'7': >-
  My limbs sink down, as if in men who ride in dream-chariots. My anxious
  thought increases exceedingly, and even a desire to die arises in me.
'8': >-
  Seeing his brother struck down by the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa—groaning in pain,
  afflicted with sorrow, grievously wounded in a vital part—
'9': >-
  Rāghava, beholding his beloved brother—his very life wandering outside his
  body—was overwhelmed by great anguish, given over to brooding and grief.
'10': >-
  Fallen into extreme despondency, his senses distraught, he lamented on seeing
  Lakṣmaṇa struck down amid the dust of battle.
'11': >-
  “Even victory, O hero, brings me no joy. What delight could the moon give,
  when it is beyond the reach of sight?
'12': >-
  What is battle to me, what are life-breaths to me? There is no purpose of war
  for me where Lakṣmaṇa lies slain on the very forefront of the battlefield.
'13': >-
  Just as that mighty one followed me when I went to the forest, so also will I
  follow him now to the inexhaustible realm of Yama.
'14': >-
  Ever dear among kinsmen and friends, ever my faithful companion—he has been
  brought to this condition by rākṣasas who fight with deceit.
'15': >-
  In one place there are wives, and in another place there are relatives; but I
  see no land at all where there is a brother born of the same womb.
'16': >-
  What have I to do with a kingdom without invincible Lakṣmaṇa? And how shall I
  speak to Sumitrā, the mother who dearly loves her son?
'17': >-
  I shall not be able to endure the reproach that will be given by Sumitrā. What
  shall I say to Kauśalyā, and what indeed to Kaikeyī?
'18': >-
  What shall I say to Bharata, and to mighty Śatrughna as well: ‘Having gone to
  the forest together with him, how have I returned without him’?
'19': >-
  Here itself, death is better than blame from one’s own kin. What evil deed
  have I done—what sinful act—in some other birth,
'20': >-
  because of which my righteous brother, standing before me, has been slain!
  Alas, brother—best among men, foremost of the brave, O lord!
'21': >-
  Leaving me alone, why do you go to the other world? And though I lament, O
  brother, why do you not speak to me?
'22': >-
  Rise! See—why do you lie thus? Look upon me with your eyes—me, poor and
  afflicted by grief, heedless, amid mountains and forests!
'23': >-
  O mighty-armed one, you were ever my comforter when I was downcast.” When Rāma
  spoke thus, his senses shaken by sorrow,
'24': >-
  Suṣeṇa, speaking words of highest counsel to console him, said: “Abandon this
  thought, O tiger among men, which brings weakness!
'25': >-
  Cast away this grief-producing anxiety, like arrows on the front of battle.
  Lakṣmaṇa, who increases fortune, has certainly not come to death.
'26': >-
  For his face is not distorted, nor has it turned dark. Let his countenance be
  observed—radiant and serene.
'27': >-
  His hands are like the undersides of lotus-leaves, and his eyes are
  exceedingly clear. Such a form is not seen in one whose life has departed, O
  lord of men.
'28': >-
  Do not give way to despair, O hero. This subduer of foes yet has life. Indeed,
  this appearance is that of one asleep—his limbs relaxed upon the ground.
'29': >-
  His heart, O hero, still heaves with breath, trembling again and again.”
  Having thus spoken to Rāghava, the greatly wise Suṣeṇa
'30': >-
  said to Hanumān, the great monkey who stood nearby: “Gentle one, go quickly
  from here to the great mountain Mahodaya,
'31': >-
  to the southern peak, where—O hero—the great herb was earlier spoken of to you
  by Jāmbavān. Bring it here.
'32': >-
  Bring, O hero, the great medicinal herbs: Viśalyakaraṇī by name, and also
  Sāvarṇyakaraṇī; Sañjīvakaraṇī, and the great herb Saṃdhānī.
'33': >-
  Bring them for the reviving of the hero Lakṣmaṇa.” Thus addressed, Hanumān
  went to the herb-bearing mountain; and that illustrious one, not knowing those
  great herbs, fell into anxious reflection.
'34': >-
  Then this resolve arose in the mind of Māruti of immeasurable energy: “I shall
  go by taking the very peak of the mountain itself!”
'35': >-
  “The herb that is born on this peak, bringing ease—by reasoning I shall
  recognize it, for Suṣeṇa spoke thus.”
'36': >-
  “If, without taking the Viśalyakaraṇī, I were to depart, then by delay there
  would be fault, and great helplessness would arise.”
'37': >-
  Thus considering, mighty Hanumān went swiftly; and reaching the best of
  mountains, he shook the summit of the peak three times.
'38': >-
  Uprooting the mountain-side filled with blossoming trees of many kinds, that
  mighty tiger among monkeys lifted it with both hands and bore it aloft evenly
  balanced.
'39': >-
  And, like a blue rain-cloud full of water springing from the sky, Hanumān
  leapt up, bearing the mountain-peak in his grasp.
'40': >-
  Arriving with great speed and setting down the peak of the mountain, Hanumān
  rested a little and then spoke to Suṣeṇa:
'41': >-
  “I do not recognize those herbs, O foremost of monkeys. Therefore I have
  brought this entire peak of that mountain here.”
'42': >-
  Praising the son of the Wind as he spoke thus, Suṣeṇa—the best of
  vānaras—plucked up and took the medicinal herbs.
'43': >-
  All those foremost of monkeys were astonished on seeing Hanumān’s deed—an act
  exceedingly difficult even for the gods.
'44': >-
  Then Suṣeṇa of great radiance, the foremost of vānaras, crushed that herb and
  placed it into Lakṣmaṇa’s nostrils.
'45': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa, slayer of hostile heroes, inhaling it while still pierced by the
  dart, at once became free of the dart and free of pain, and quickly rose up
  from the earth.
'46': >-
  Seeing Lakṣmaṇa risen from the ground, the monkeys, filled with joy, honored
  him, crying, “Well done! Well done!”
'47': >-
  “Come, come!” said Rāma to Lakṣmaṇa, slayer of hostile heroes; and clasping
  him in a tight embrace, with eyes troubled by tears, he held him fast.
'48': >-
  And Rāghava, embracing the son of Sumitrā, then said: “By good fortune, O
  hero, I behold you returned again from death!
'49': >-
  For I have no need of life, nor of Sītā, nor even of victory. Of what use is
  life to me if you had come to the state of death?”
'50': >-
  As that great-souled Rāghava spoke thus, Lakṣmaṇa, weary and in a faint voice,
  replied:
'51': >-
  “Having once made that vow, O you whose prowess is ever true to your promise,
  you ought not to speak thus, like some light and feeble man.
'52': >-
  For those who speak truth do not make false vows. The mark of greatness is the
  fulfilling of one’s vow.
'53': >-
  Nor is it fitting for you, O sinless one, to fall into despair because of me.
  Today, by the slaying of Rāvaṇa, uphold your vow!
'54': >-
  The enemy who has entered the path of your arrows will not depart alive—like a
  great elephant that cannot escape a roaring lion with sharp fangs.
'55': >-
  As for me, I seek the swift killing of that wicked-souled one, before this
  sun—his work accomplished—goes down.
'56': >-
  If you desire the slaying of Rāvaṇa in battle, and if you wish your vow indeed
  to be fulfilled; if you long for the king’s daughter, O noble one—then do as I
  say, swiftly today, O hero.
'57': >-
  Thus ends the two-hundred-and-second canto, named “The Reviving of Lakṣmaṇa,”
  in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial
  epic.
