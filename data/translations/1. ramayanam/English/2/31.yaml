  Now begins the thirty-first canto in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Permission for Lakṣmaṇa to Follow into the Forest.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that entire conversation, Lakṣmaṇa—who had come there earlier—stood
  with his face disturbed by tears, unable to endure his grief.
'2': >-
  That delight of the Raghus, pressing firmly upon his brother’s feet, spoke to
  Sītā and to the highly illustrious Rāghava, the great observer of vows.
'3': >-
  “If your resolve is made to go to the forest—abounding in deer and
  elephants—then I shall follow you into the forest, bow in hand, going before
  you.”
'4': >-
  “With me accompanying you, you shall roam those lovely woodland tracts,
  resounding on all sides with birds and herds of wild animals.”
'5': >-
  “I do not choose the conquest of heaven, nor immortality; nor do I desire the
  lordship of worlds, not even that, without you.”
'6': >-
  While thus speaking, Saumitri—firmly resolved upon forest-dwelling—though
  restrained again by Rāma with many soothing words, spoke once more.
'7': >-
  “Since I was granted leave by you earlier, what is this now—that restraint is
  being imposed upon me again?”
'8': >-
  “For what reason is this prohibition being made against me when I desire to
  go? This I wish to know, O sinless one, for doubt has arisen in my mind.”
'9': >-
  Then the mighty and radiant Rāma spoke, before all, to Lakṣmaṇa—who stood
  ready to go ahead, steadfast and self-controlled, beseeching with joined
  palms.
'10': >-
  “You are affectionate, devoted to dharma, steadfast; ever established upon the
  righteous path; dear to me, equal to my very life, obedient, one who is hard
  to overcome, and my companion.”
'11': >-
  “But, Saumitri, if you go with me today to that forest, who will look after
  Kausalyā or the illustrious Sumitrā?”
'12': >-
  “That mighty king—ensnared by the noose of desire—who, like a rain-cloud upon
  the earth, showers people with desired objects,”
'13': >-
  “—having attained this kingdom, Kaikeyī, the daughter of king Aśvapati, will
  not act well toward her co-wives who are afflicted with sorrow.”
'14': >-
  “Having obtained the kingship, Bharata—attached to Kaikeyī—will not support
  Kausalyā and Sumitrā, who are exceedingly distressed.”
'15': >-
  “Therefore, Saumitri, support that noble lady here—either by your own efforts
  or by securing the king’s favor. Act upon this purpose which I have stated:
  sustain Kausalyā.”
'16': >-
  “In doing so, your devotion toward me will be clearly shown; and in the
  honoring of elders and in the service of one’s mother, there is
  dharma—unequalled and great.”
'17': >-
  “Do thus for my sake, Saumitri, O delight of the Raghus; for if our mother is
  separated from us, she will have no happiness.”
'18': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāma in gentle speech, Lakṣmaṇa—skilled in understanding
  words and proficient in reply—then answered Rāma.
'19': >-
  “By your very majesty, O hero, Bharata will honor Kausalyā and Sumitrā with
  due care; of this there is no doubt.”
'20': >-
  “But if, having obtained the excellent kingdom, Bharata—ill-disposed, O hero,
  and especially intoxicated with pride—should fail to protect them when they
  are in distress,”
'21': >-
  “then I shall slay that evil-minded and cruel man—there is no doubt. And even
  all those of his faction—what to speak of the three worlds—”
'22': >-
  “Kausalyā, that noble lady, could maintain even a thousand such as I, for she
  has the revenues of a thousand villages with their dependents assigned to her
  support.”
'23': >-
  “For my own maintenance, and likewise for my mother’s, that high-minded lady
  is fully sufficient; she can sustain men like me as well.”
'24': >-
  “Make me your attendant; there is no impropriety in this. I shall be fulfilled
  of purpose, and your own aim will be accomplished.”
'25': >-
  “Taking up my strung bow, bearing a spade and a basket, I shall go before you,
  showing you the path.”
'26': >-
  “I shall daily bring you roots and fruits, and other forest fare as well—food
  fit for ascetics.”
'27': >-
  “You, together with the princess of Videha, shall delight upon mountain
  slopes; I shall do everything for you—whether you are awake or asleep.”
'28': >-
  Pleased by these words, Rāma replied to him: “Go, Saumitri, and take leave of
  all our friends and well-wishers.”
'29': >-
  “And those two bows—terrible in aspect—divinely given by the great-souled
  Varuṇa himself to Janaka at the time of his great sacrifice,”
'30': >-
  “and the two divine, impenetrable armors; and the two quivers with
  inexhaustible arrows; and two swords, bright and spotless as the sun, adorned
  with gold,”
'31': >-
  “—all this weaponry has been respectfully kept in the preceptor’s abode. Take
  up all the weapons and return quickly, Lakṣmaṇa.”
'32': >-
  Resolved upon dwelling in the forest, he took leave of his friends and
  well-wishers; then, approaching the preceptor of the Ikṣvākus, he received the
  excellent weapons.
'33': >-
  Saumitri then displayed to Rāma all those weapons—divine, befitting a royal
  tiger—honored and decked with garlands.
'34': >-
  Self-possessed Rāma spoke to Lakṣmaṇa, who had come with joy: “You have come
  at the right time, gentle one—at the very time I desired, O Lakṣmaṇa.”
'35': >-
  “I wish to give away this wealth that is mine—to brāhmaṇas and to
  ascetics—together with you, O scorcher of foes.”
'36': >-
  “The foremost among the twice-born dwell here with steadfast devotion to their
  teachers; and to them, and further to all who are dependent upon me, (I would
  give).”
'37': >-
  “Quickly bring Suya-jña, the noble son of Vasiṣṭha, the foremost among
  brāhmaṇas. I too shall set out for the forest, having worshiped all the
  well-conducted and other twice-born.”
'38': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-first canto in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “Permission for Lakṣmaṇa to Follow
  into the Forest.”
