  Now begins the Holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the fiftieth
  sarga, called “The Entry into Ṛkṣa-bila (the Bear-Cave).”
'1': >-
  Hanumān the monkey, having met together with Tārā’s son Aṅgada, then
  searches—examining the caves of the Vindhya and the dense, impenetrable
  thickets as well.
'2': >-
  On every side were caves frequented by lions and tigers; and in the rugged
  tracts of that lord of mountains, amid its great waterfalls too, they
  searched.
'3': >-
  They reached the south‑western ridge of that mountain; and for those who
  stayed there itself, time passed on.
'4': >-
  That region was exceedingly hard to search out—vast, full of caves and dense
  woods. There, the son of the Wind (Hanumān) searched the entire mountain.
'5': >-
  Separated from one another, yet not far from each other, were Gaja, Gavākṣa,
  Gavaya, Śarabha, and Gandhamādana.
'6': >-
  And also Mainda and Dvivida, Hanumān, and Jāmbavān; Aṅgada the yuvarāja, and
  Tāra who ranged the forest.
'7': >-
  After tracking through lands covered with networks of mountains, seeking in
  the southern direction, as they searched there, they beheld an opened cavern.
'8': >-
  It was named the difficult Ṛkṣa-bila, guarded by a demon. Yet they, oppressed
  by hunger and thirst, weary and seeking water, approached it.
'9': >-
  They saw that vast cave, overgrown and strewn about with creepers and trees.
  From there, krauñcha-birds, swans, and also sārasas were coming forth.
'10': >-
  And cakravākas, their bodies wet with water, their limbs reddened by the
  pollen-dust of lotuses—then, having come up to that cave, fragrant and hard to
  cross,
'11': >-
  the foremost of monkeys became intent with wonder. Suspicion arose in them as
  they looked upon that cavern, O best of leapers.
'12': >-
  Delighted, radiant, and very strong, they advanced toward it—filled with many
  kinds of creatures, and resembling the very abode of the lord of Dānavas.
'13': >-
  Terrible as though it were, hard to behold and difficult to enter on every
  side—then Hanumān, the son of Māruta, whose form was like a mountain-peak,
'14': >-
  skilled in the ways of dreadful wilderness-forests, spoke to the monkeys:
  “Having tracked through lands covered with networks of mountains, in the
  southern direction,
'15': >-
  we are all utterly worn out, and we do not see Maithilī. And from this very
  cave, swans, krauñchas together with sārasas,
'16': >-
  and cakravākas, their bodies wet with water, are flying out in all directions.
  Surely there is water here—either a well, or else a lake.
'17': >-
  And these trees at the mouth of the cave stand glossy with moisture.” Thus
  addressed, they all entered that cave, covered in darkness.
'18': >-
  The monkeys beheld a place where neither moon nor sun shone—causing the hair
  to stand on end; and, observing there lions and various beasts and birds,
'19': >-
  those tiger-like monkeys, having entered that cave shrouded in
  darkness—neither their sight served them, nor their brilliance, nor their
  prowess.
'20': >-
  Their movement was like the wind’s, yet their sight moved within the gloom.
  Then those elephant-like monkeys rushed into that cave with speed.
'21': >-
  And they beheld a splendid and delightful region of light—an excellent place.
  Thereafter, within that fearsome cave, thick with many kinds of trees,
'22': >-
  clasping one another, they went on for the distance of a yojana. Having lost
  clear awareness, thirsty, bewildered, and seeking water,
'23': >-
  they wandered about in that cave for some time, unwearied. Those leaping
  beings became emaciated, with wretched faces, utterly exhausted.
'24': >-
  When the heroes saw a radiance and had become hopeless of life, then, coming
  to that region—pleasant, and a forest free from darkness—
'25': >-
  they beheld golden trees, shining with the splendor of blazing fire: śālas,
  tālas, tamālas, puṃnāgas, vañjulas, and dhavas,
'26': >-
  campakas, nāga-trees, and flowering karṇikāras—adorned with clusters of
  wondrous golden hue, and likewise with red fresh sprouts,
'27': >-
  with garlands and with creepers, as though ornamented with golden jewelry;
  with platforms made of vaidūrya-gems, gleaming like the rising sun,
'28': >-
  and trees of golden make, resplendent in beauty. And lotus-ponds of
  sapphire-vaidūrya color, filled with flocks of birds,
'29': >-
  surrounded by great golden trees resembling the young sun, and with fishes
  made of gold, and with great lotuses as well,
'30': >-
  they saw there lotus-lakes furnished with clear, tranquil waters. They also
  saw aerial cars (vimānas) of gold, and of silver too,
'31': >-
  with windows of pure gold, and covered with nets of pearls; with floors of
  gold and silver, and set with vaidūrya jewels,
'32': >-
  and the monkeys saw, on every side, the foremost of mansions there. They saw
  flowering, fruit-bearing trees, resembling coral and gems,
'33': >-
  and golden bees all around, and honey everywhere. They saw beds and
  seats—variegated with gems and gold,
'34': >-
  of many kinds, vast and spread about on every side. They saw heaps of vessels
  of gold, of silver, and of bronze,
'35': >-
  and piles of divine agaru and sandalwood; pure foods fit to be eaten, and
  roots and fruits,
'36': >-
  and precious conveyances, and honey rich with flavor; and heaps of divine
  garments, and of garments of great value,
'37': >-
  and stores of splendid blankets and of skins—set out here and there, shining
  with the radiance of fire.
'38': >-
  The monkeys beheld bright heaps of refined gold. Searching here and there
  within that cavern, those mighty ones,
'39': >-
  the heroic monkeys saw, at some distance, a certain woman. And there they saw
  her, wearing bark-cloth and a black antelope-skin as her garment,
'40': >-
  a female ascetic, restrained in diet, blazing as it were with austerity-born
  splendor. The monkeys, astonished, stood still on all sides. Then Hanumān
  questioned her there: “Who are you? And whose is this cave?”
'41': >-
  Then Hanumān, mountain-like in stature, with palms joined, having bowed to
  that aged lady, asked: “Who are you? And whose dwelling is this cave? And
  whose are these jewels—tell us.”
'42': >-
  Thus ends the fiftieth sarga, named “The Entry into Ṛkṣa-bila,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya.
