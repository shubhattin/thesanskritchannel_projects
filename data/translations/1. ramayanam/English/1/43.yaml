  Now begins the forty-third canto in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Descent of the Gaṅgā.”
'1': >-
  When that Lord of lords (Śiva) had departed, Rāma, (Bhagīratha) pressed the
  earth with the tip of his thumb (standing in severe austerity) and worshipped
  (Śiva) thus for a full year.
'2': >-
  When the year was completed, the Lord of Umā, Paśupati—revered by all the
  worlds—spoke these words to the king.
'3': >-
  “I am pleased with you, O best of men. I shall do what is dear to you. I will
  bear upon my head the daughter of the king of mountains (Gaṅgā).”
'4': >-
  Thereupon the eldest daughter of Himavān, revered by all the worlds, assumed a
  form exceedingly vast, and a force (speed and rush) unbearable (to withstand).
'5': >-
  Falling from the sky, O Rāma, she descended upon Śiva—upon Śiva’s head; and
  that goddess Gaṅgā, most difficult to restrain, reflected (within herself).
'6': >-
  “With my torrent I shall seize Śaṅkara and plunge into the netherworlds
  (Pātāla).” Knowing her intention and pride, the blessed Hara became wrathful.
'7': >-
  Then the three-eyed Lord resolved to make her course disappear (to obstruct
  and conceal her flow). The holy Gaṅgā fell upon the holy head of Rudra.
'8': >-
  In the deep hollows of the circle of matted locks—like Himavān himself, O
  Rāma—though she strove with effort, she could not in any way reach the earth.
'9': >-
  Indeed she found no outlet from within that mass of matted hair; there the
  goddess wandered about for many a multitude of years.
'10': >-
  Again he beheld her there, while engaged in supreme austerity; and by that
  (austerity) he was exceedingly pleased, O delight of the Raghus.
'11': >-
  Then Hara released Gaṅgā toward Bindusaras; as she was being let loose, seven
  streams came into being from her.
'12': >-
  Hlādinī, Pāvanī, and likewise Nalinī—these three auspicious Gaṅgās, the holy
  waters of Śiva, went toward the eastern direction.
'13': >-
  Suchakṣu, Sītā, and Sindhu, the great river—these three auspicious ones went
  toward the western direction.
'14': >-
  The seventh then followed the chariot of Bhagīratha. And Bhagīratha too, that
  royal sage, mounted a divine chariot.
'15': >-
  The great-glorious king proceeded in front, and Gaṅgā followed him as
  well—having come from the sky to Śaṅkara’s head, and from there having reached
  the earth.
'16': >-
  There the waters rushed on with a mighty roar, accompanied by hosts of fishes
  and tortoises, and likewise by schools of śiṃśumāras
  (river-dolphins/crocodilians).
'17': >-
  The earth shone resplendent with those falling down and those already fallen
  (waters and beings borne along). Then the god-sages and gandharvas, and hosts
  of yakṣas and siddhas as well—
'18': >-
  —looked on from the sky at Gaṅgā’s descent to the earth, while in aerial cars
  shaped like cities, and with excellent horses and great elephants.
'19': >-
  The deities, established there and moving about in their heavenly courses,
  beheld in the world this wondrous, most exalted descent of the Gaṅgā.
'20': >-
  Desiring to see it, the hosts of gods of immeasurable might gathered there;
  and with the gods arriving in throngs, the brilliance of their ornaments
  (also) shone forth.
'21': >-
  The sky—laden with that mass of water—appeared like a hundred suns, with
  throngs of śiṃśumāras, companies of serpents, and restless fishes.
'22': >-
  Then the firmament became as though strewn with lightning, while pale sprays
  of water were scattered in thousands of ways.
'23': >-
  The sky was filled as if with autumnal clouds, along with flights of swans; in
  places the current sped swiftly, in places it flowed windingly, and in places
  it stretched long and straight.
'24': >-
  In some places it bent down; in some it surged upward; in some it moved
  slowly, little by little. In some places water struck against water again and
  again,
'25': >-
  and repeatedly, after rising along an upward course, it fell back upon the
  earth. Thus that water, slipping from Śaṅkara’s head, again and again fell
  upon the surface of the ground.
'26': >-
  Then that water shone forth—spotless, clear, and freed of taint. There, hosts
  of sages and gandharvas, and dwellers upon the earth—
'27': >-
  —touched that water which had fallen from Śiva’s body, holding it to be
  sanctifying. And those who, through a curse, had fallen from the sky to the
  earth—
'28': >-
  —having performed ablution there, became free of defilement. Freed from their
  grievous faults by that water, they then became endowed with auspiciousness,
'29': >-
  and entering the sky once more, they attained their own worlds. The whole
  world rejoiced, delighted by that radiant water.
'30': >-
  Having bathed in the Gaṅgā, (Bhagīratha) became free from impurity. For
  Bhagīratha, the royal sage, mounted the divine chariot,
'31': >-
  and the great king proceeded in front, while Gaṅgā followed behind him. All
  the gods with their companies of sages, and daityas, dānavas, and rākṣasas—
'32': >-
  —the foremost gandharvas and yakṣas, together with kinnaras and great
  serpents; and all the apsarases too, O Rāma, followed Bhagīratha’s chariot.
'33': >-
  All the aquatic creatures also followed after Gaṅgā with joy. Wherever King
  Bhagīratha went, thither went illustrious Gaṅgā,
'34': >-
  the best of rivers, the destroyer of all sins. Then indeed, of the sacrificer
  Jahnu of marvellous deeds—
'35': >-
  —Gaṅgā flooded the great sacrificial enclosure of that high-souled one.
  Knowing this affront, Jahnu too became angry, O Rāghava,
'36': >-
  and drank up all the water of the Gaṅgā—an act most astonishing. Then the gods
  with the gandharvas and the sages were exceedingly amazed,
'37': >-
  and they worshipped that great-souled Jahnu, the best of men; and they caused
  Gaṅgā to be accepted as the daughter of that great-souled sage.
'38': >-
  Then, pleased, the mighty and glorious lord released her from his two ears.
  Therefore Gaṅgā is called Jahnu’s daughter, and she is also known as Jāhnavī.
'39': >-
  And again Gaṅgā went forth, following Bhagīratha’s chariot; and that foremost
  of rivers then reached the ocean as well.
'40': >-
  She approached Rasātala (the nether region) for the accomplishment of his
  undertaking. And King Bhagīratha, the royal sage, bringing Gaṅgā along with
  careful effort,
'41': >-
  beheld his forefathers, reduced to ashes, devoid of consciousness. Then that
  excellent water of Gaṅgā inundated that heap of ashes; purified of sin, they
  attained heaven, O best of the Raghus.
'42': >-
  Thus ends the forty-third canto in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Descent of the Gaṅgā.”
