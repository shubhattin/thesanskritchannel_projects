  Now begins the one-hundred-and-fourteenth Sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the
  illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “Bharata’s Entry into Ayodhyā.”
'1': >-
  Then the mighty and greatly renowned Bharata, approaching in a chariot whose
  sound was deep and resonant, swiftly entered Ayodhyā.
'2': >-
  He entered it as one might enter a city that had become like a dark
  night—haunted by cats and owls, bereft and stained, emptied of men and
  elephants, smitten by gloom, black, and without brightness.
'3': >-
  And Ayodhyā appeared to him like Rohiṇī, beloved of the Moon (the foe of
  Rāhu), blazing with her native splendour, yet grievously afflicted when the
  ग्रह (the seizing power, an eclipse) rises upon her—radiant, and still
  tormented.
'4': >-
  It seemed like a mountain-river grown thin: its waters only slightly warm and
  faintly disturbed, its birds scorched, as it were, by the heat of dharma, its
  fish, great fishes, and crocodiles hidden away, and its current meagre.
'5': >-
  It was like the flame of a sacrificial fire—golden in hue, yet smokeless—after
  the oblation has been poured in, and then, having flared up, has sunk into
  dissolution and died away.
'6': >-
  It resembled an army in a great battle—its armour shattered, its swift horses
  and chariots and banners broken down, its heroic warriors slain, fallen into
  calamity and ruin.
'7': >-
  It was like an ocean-wave risen up with foam and sound, and then stilled—its
  gusts of wind abated, its roar fallen silent, its motion quieted.
'8': >-
  It was like a sacrificial altar after the time of the Soma-pressing is
  over—abandoned by all the sacred implements and by the handsome officiating
  priests, and left behind, without its former reverberation.
'9': >-
  It was like a cow, distressed, standing amid the herd, not grazing even fresh
  grass—forsaken by the bull, restless and yearning among the cattle.
'10': >-
  It was like a new necklace of pearls that has been parted from its finest,
  brightly shining, well-set gems—its lustre diminished by separation from
  precious jewels.
'11': >-
  It was like a star that has suddenly fallen from its station in the sky
  because its merit is exhausted—its spread of radiance drawn in, its brilliance
  gathered up, as though it had dropped down from heaven.
'12': >-
  It was like a forest-creeper in spring’s end, once bound with flowers and
  humming with intoxicated bees, but then scorched by a swiftly spreading
  forest-fire—wearied and blasted.
'13': >-
  It was like the sky when covered with clouds—its paths (as of the Vedas and
  orderly life) confused, its activity stunned, its markets and shops shut and
  curtailed, the moon and stars hidden away beneath the veiling masses of cloud.
'14': >-
  It was like an untended drinking-ground in the open—encircled by shattered
  cups and bowls once used by the best drinkers, now left desolate, its
  revellers laid low.
'15': >-
  It was like a public water-shed that has collapsed—its ground broken and
  sunken, covered with broken vessels, its water already drawn and used up, and
  now fallen into ruin.
'16': >-
  It was like a mighty bowstring, broad and stretched out, fitted by strong men
  with its cords—yet cut down by arrows and fallen upon the earth, slipped from
  its weapon.
'17': >-
  It was like a young maiden, suddenly driven hard by a battle-eager
  horseman—her burdens cast away and her strength abandoned, left weak and
  helpless.
'18': >-
  It was like a large pond dried of water, crowded still with great fishes and
  many tortoises, its banks broken and spread out, and its lotuses plucked away.
'19': >-
  It was like a man of no gladness, for whom unguents are forbidden—his
  body-staff (his frame) without ornaments, as though scorched by grief and
  heated by sorrow.
'20': >-
  It was like the splendour of the sun entering a deepened rainy season—its
  light veiled over by circles of cloud, hidden beneath dark blue rain-clouds.
'21': >-
  Then Bharata, the illustrious son of Daśaratha, seated in his chariot, spoke
  to the charioteer who was driving that excellent car.
'22': >-
  “Why indeed is it that today the deep, continuous sound that is usually heard
  in the city of Ayodhyā is not heard—those voices of song and the music of
  instruments as before?”
'23': >-
  “And the fragrance of Vāruṇī liquor, the mingled scent of garlands, and the
  perfumed smoke of burning agaru does not waft all around.”
'24': >-
  “The din of the finest vehicles, the agreeable sound of horses, the cries of
  sportive elephants, and the great rumble of chariots—none of this is now heard
  in this city, since Rāma has been sent into exile.”
'25': >-
  “And sandal and agaru scents, and costly new garlands—since Rāma has gone, the
  young men, scorched with grief, do not partake of these.”
'26': >-
  “Men wearing variegated garlands do not go out on festive processions; no
  celebrations arise, for the city is afflicted by sorrow for Rāma.”
'27': >-
  “Surely, with my brother, the lustre of this city too has departed. For this
  Ayodhyā does not shine—like a night deprived of the constellation Arjunī
  (Phalgunī).”
'28': >-
  “When indeed will my brother return, like a great festival itself, and produce
  joy in Ayodhyā—like a cloud bringing delight in the heat of summer?”
'29': >-
  “On the great roads of Ayodhyā, young men in fair attire, walking with proud
  gait and moving swiftly, no longer appear in crowds.”
'30': >-
  Speaking thus in many ways, he entered his father’s dwelling—bereft of that
  lord of men (the king), like a cave bereft of its lion.
'31': >-
  Then Bharata, self-possessed yet plunged in anguish, beheld that inner
  palace—its splendour abandoned, like a day forsaken by the sun, left as though
  deserted even by the gods; and, seeing it all empty and solitary, he let fall
  tears, grievously afflicted with sorrow.
'32': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-fourteenth Sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the
  venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “Bharata’s Entry into
  Ayodhyā.”
