  Now begins the Thirty-eighth Sarga (chapter) of the Araṇya Kāṇḍa of the sacred
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Greatness of Rāma’s Missiles (Divine
  Weapons).”
'1': >-
  “Once, while I was roaming over this earth, relying upon my own
  valour—mountain-like in stature and bearing the strength of a thousand
  elephants—
'2': >-
  resembling a dark-blue rain-cloud, wearing earrings of heated gold, a crowned
  warrior bearing a mace as his weapon, I spread fear among the peoples of the
  world.
'3': >-
  I ranged through the Daṇḍaka forest, devouring the flesh of sages. Then the
  righteous-souled great ascetic Viśvāmitra, terrified of me,
'4': >-
  went himself to Daśaratha, lord of men, and spoke these words: ‘Let Rāma
  protect me, composed and vigilant, at the time of the sacrificial rite.’
'5': >-
  ‘O lord of men, from Mārīca a dreadful fear has arisen for me.’ Thus
  addressed, the righteous king Daśaratha then
'6': >-
  replied to that most fortunate great sage Viśvāmitra: ‘This Rāghava is not yet
  twelve years of age, and he has not yet been equipped with weapons.’
'7': >-
  ‘Yet, if you wish, my army shall go with me—my fourfold host—and I myself
  shall come and confront the night-roamer.
'8': >-
  O best of sages, I shall slay the enemy of yours as you desire.’ When he had
  spoken thus, the sage said this to the king:
'9': >-
  ‘Other than Rāma, no power in the world is sufficient against that rākṣasa.
  Even you are the protector of the gods in battles,
'10': >-
  and deeds performed by you are renowned in the three worlds, O king. Let there
  indeed be a great army—but let it remain here, O scorcher of foes.
'11': >-
  Though a boy, this one is of great splendour and fully capable of subduing
  him. I shall go taking Rāma with me. May welfare be yours, O scorcher of
  foes.’
'12': >-
  Having spoken thus, that sage, taking the prince with him,
  departed—Viśvāmitra, exceedingly pleased—toward his own hermitage.
'13': >-
  There, in the Daṇḍaka forest, while the sage had been consecrated for the
  sacrifice and intent upon it, Rāma stood present, wondrously twanging and
  stretching his bow.
'14': >-
  Though not yet showing the marks of full youth, illustrious—still a boy,
  dark-hued, of auspicious eyes—wearing a single garment, bearing a bow, with
  his hair in a topknot, and adorned with a garland of gold,
'15': >-
  he adorned the Daṇḍaka forest with his own blazing radiance. Then Rāma
  appeared like the newly risen young moon.
'16': >-
  Then I—cloud-like in appearance, wearing earrings of heated gold, mighty, and
  puffed up with pride because of boons granted—came to that hermitage-region.
'17': >-
  Seeing him there, I rushed in at once, weapon raised. But on seeing me, he
  calmly strung his bow without agitation.
'18': >-
  Deluded, I despised Rāghava thinking, ‘He is only a boy,’ and, in great haste,
  I ran toward Viśvāmitra’s sacrificial altar.
'19': >-
  Then from him a keen arrow was released—sharp, a destroyer of foes. Struck by
  it, I was hurled and cast into the sea a hundred yojanas away.
'20': >-
  That hero did not desire to slay me; thus, dear one, I was spared. Yet by the
  force of Rāma’s arrow I was driven off, my mind bewildered.
'21': >-
  Cast down by him into the deep waters of the ocean, I regained consciousness
  only after a long time, dear one, and then went toward the city of Laṅkā.
'22': >-
  Thus was I then released, while my companions were felled—by Rāma, who though
  untrained in weapon-lore, was still a boy of unwearied prowess.
'23': >-
  Therefore, even as I am strongly restraining you—if you engage Rāma in
  hostility, you will swiftly meet dreadful calamities and you will not survive.
'24': >-
  You will bring torment and misfortune upon the rākṣasas who are skilled in
  sports and pleasures, in arts and amusements, and who delight in festivals and
  assemblies.
'25': >-
  You will see the city of Laṅkā—crowded with mansions and palaces, adorned with
  many kinds of jewels—destroyed, because of the Maithilī.
'26': >-
  Even those who commit no sins, though pure, perish by resorting to sin—like
  fish in a serpent’s lake perishing because of another’s fault.
'27': >-
  You will see rākṣasas—limbs smeared with heavenly sandalpaste, adorned with
  divine ornaments—slain upon the ground, and that will be due to your own
  fault.
'28': >-
  You will see night-roamers—some robbed of their wives, and others with their
  wives—fleeing in all ten directions, those who remain after slaughter helpless
  and without refuge.
'29': >-
  You will surely see Laṅkā surrounded by a net of arrows, enveloped in tongues
  of fire, its houses burned down.
'30': >-
  There is no sin greater or more dreadful than laying hands upon another’s
  wife. Thousands of women are within your keeping, O king.
'31': >-
  Be devoted to your own wife. Protect your lineage, O rākṣasa. Preserve your
  honour, prosperity, and kingdom, and your own dear life.
'32': >-
  Your gentle wives, your circle of friends as well—if you wish to enjoy them
  for long, do not do what is displeasing to Rāma.
'33': >-
  Though I, your well-wisher, restrain you strongly—if, in violence, you violate
  Sītā, you shall go with strength exhausted, together with your kinsmen, to
  Yama’s abode, your life torn away by Rāma’s arrows.”
'34': >-
  Thus ends the Thirty-eighth Sarga of the Araṇya Kāṇḍa in the sacred Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Greatness of Rāma’s Missiles (Divine
  Weapons).”
