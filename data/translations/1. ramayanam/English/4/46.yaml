  Now begins the Forty-sixth Sarga in the Kishkindha-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, called “The Account of the Roaming over the Circle of the Earth.”
'1': >-
  When the lords of the monkeys had departed, Rama said to Sugriva: “How is it
  that you have come to know the entire circuit of the earth?”
'2': >-
  Then Sugriva, of humble and submissive mind, spoke to Rama: “Let it be heard;
  I shall relate all of it—my account—in detail.”
'3': >-
  “At the time when Vali was chasing the danava named Dundubhi—who had assumed
  the form of a buffalo—towards the Malaya mountain,”
'4': >-
  “then that buffalo entered into a cavern of Malaya. And Vali too entered
  there, intent on slaying him.”
'5': >-
  “Thereupon I was placed at the mouth of the cave, obediently waiting. Yet Vali
  did not come out even when a full year had passed.”
'6': >-
  “Then, with the rushing force of blood, that cavern became filled. Seeing
  that, I was astonished and, afflicted by sorrow for my brother,”
'7': >-
  “and having lost my judgment, I concluded clearly that my elder brother had
  been slain. I made a rock—like a mountain—at the entrance of the cave,”
'8': >-
  “thinking: ‘Unable to come out, the buffalo will perish.’ Then I went back to
  Kishkindha, hopeless regarding his life.”
'9': >-
  “And having obtained the vast kingdom, and Tara along with Ruma, and dwelling
  there together with friends, I lived, my fevered anxiety gone.”
'10': >-
  “Then Vali, that bull among monkeys, came back after killing him. Then,
  constrained by fear and out of deference, I yielded the kingdom to him.”
'11': >-
  “That wicked-souled Vali, disturbed in his senses, sought to kill me; Vali
  pursued me as I fled, together with my ministers.”
'12': >-
  “Then, pursued by that Vali, I ran on; beholding many rivers, forests, and
  cities,”
'13': >-
  “the earth then appeared to me like the surface of a mirror—like a whirling
  firebrand’s circle—made as small as a cow’s hoof-print.”
'14': >-
  “Going then to the eastern quarter, I beheld diverse trees, delightful
  mountains with their caves and valleys, and various lakes.”
'15': >-
  “There I saw the Udaya mountain adorned with minerals; and also the Ocean of
  Milk, ever the abode of the Apsaras.”
'16': >-
  “But being chased at that time by Vali and driven hard, I suddenly turned back
  and set out again, O mighty one.”
'17': >-
  “From that quarter I again went forth towards the southern direction, thick
  with Vindhya trees and beautified by sandalwood.”
'18': >-
  “Seeing forests and mountains in between, I looked further to the south; and
  having reached the western quarter also, I was still pursued by Vali.”
'19': >-
  “Thus, seeing many regions and that excellent mountain where the sun sets, and
  having reached that best of mountains, I ran northward.”
'20': >-
  “To the Himalaya and to Meru, and to the northern ocean as well—when, pursued
  by Vali, I found no refuge,”
'21': >-
  “then Hanuman, endowed with intelligence, spoke these words to me: ‘Now, O
