  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the thirty-second
  sarga, called “Sītā’s Lament.”
'1': >-
  That Sītā, seeing that head and that excellent bow, and hearing from Hanūmān
  the account of the encounter with Sugrīva,
'2': >-
  and seeing the eyes, the complexion of the face, that countenance resembling
  her lord’s; the hair and the end-portion of the hair; and that auspicious
  crest-jewel,
'3': >-
  by all these tokens recognizing it, overwhelmed with exceeding sorrow, she
  reproached Kaikeyī there, crying aloud like a kurarī-bird (the osprey) wailing
  in distress.
'4': >-
  “Be you satisfied in your desire, O Kaikeyī! This delight of the dynasty has
  been slain; the entire lineage has been brought to ruin by you, who are ever
  given to strife.
'5': >-
  What offence, indeed, did Rāma commit against Kaikeyī, the noble one—he whom
  I, after giving bark-garments, was made to send forth into exile in the
  forest?
'6': >-
  Having spoken thus, Vaidehī, trembling—an austere, suffering woman—fell to the
  earth, like a plantain-tree cut down.
'7': >-
  After a short while, regaining composure and then recovering consciousness,
  she approached that head and, her eyes full of tears, began to lament.
'8': >-
  “Alas! I am undone, O mighty-armed one—follower of the vow of heroism, and
  true to your vow! To this last condition of yours have I come—made a widow!
'9': >-
  The first ‘death’ of a woman is said to be the failing of her husband; yet
  you, who were of noble conduct, have perished before my very eyes—though I am
  devoted to righteous conduct.
'10': >-
  Great is the misery of me who have fallen into distress, sunk in the ocean of
  grief—he who was ready to rescue me, even he, you, has been struck down!
'11': >-
  And my mother-in-law, Kauśalyā, O Rāghava—because of you, her son—has been
  made like a cow that has lost her calf, yet remains full of affection, bereft
  of her young.
'12': >-
  A long life was foretold for you, O Rāghava, even by those skilled in fate;
  false has their word become—you are short-lived, O Rāghava!
'13': >-
  Or else, even the wisdom of one who is truly wise—such as you—perishes; thus
  does Time ‘cook’ and consume him, for Time is indeed the source and over-lord
  of all beings.
'14': >-
  Having met with death unforeseen, why did you—knower of polity and the science
  of right conduct, knowing the remedies for calamities and skilled in avoiding
  misfortune—fail to avert it?
'15': >-
  Thus, clasping you in its embrace—cruel, fierce, and merciless—Kālarātrī has
  torn you away from me, O lotus-eyed one!
'16': >-
  Leaving me behind here—an ascetic woman—O mighty-armed one, O bull among men,
  you have departed, as though abandoning the earth itself, your beloved wife.
'17': >-
  Ever with effort have I continually worshipped you with perfumes and garlands.
  This is your bow, dear to me, O hero—adorned with gold.
'18': >-
  Surely you, O sinless one, have now reached heaven together with my
  father-in-law Daśaratha, and with all your forefathers besides.
'19': >-
  And having become like a star in the sky—one who performed mighty deeds—you
  now disregard your own holy, meritorious race of royal seers.
'20': >-
  Why do you not look upon me, O king? Or why do you not speak to me—me, your
  wife and companion, a young woman who has attained you while you are yet
  youthful?
'21': >-
  Remember that promise you made when, taking my hand, you said, ‘I shall walk
  (this life) with you.’ Remember that, O Kakutstha—and take me also, sorrowing
  as I am.
'22': >-
  Why, leaving me behind, have you gone, O best of those who move on the true
  path—departing from this world to yonder world, abandoning me also in grief?
'23': >-
  Your lovely body, auspicious and beautiful, which was embraced by me
  alone—surely it is now being dragged and torn by flesh-eating creatures!
'24': >-
  Having performed Agniṣṭoma and other sacrifices, with gifts duly bestowed—by
  what rites of consecration, by what Agnihotra and funerary sacraments, will
  you now be honored?
'25': >-
  Kauśalyā, yearning only for grief, will look upon Lakṣmaṇa—one returned out of
  the three who had gone forth as ascetics (into the forest).
'26': >-
  And when she questions him, he will surely relate to her the slaying of your
  ally and strength—how you too were slain at night by the rākṣasas.
'27': >-
  Knowing you to have been killed while asleep, and me gone to the rākṣasa’s
  dwelling, she will not remain alive, O Rāghava—her heart shattered.
'28': >-
  Because of me—an ignoble woman—Rāma, the blameless son of a king, though
  mighty, after crossing the ocean, has been slain as if in a mere cow’s
  hoof-print (as though it were nothing)!
'29': >-
  I, married to the son of Daśaratha, through delusion—foul to my own
  lineage—have become death itself to noble prince Rāma, being his wife.
'30': >-
  Surely by me some other birth (or better destiny) and the highest gift were
  obstructed—since I now mourn here as the wife of one who was a refuge to all
  guests (to all who sought shelter).
'31': >-
  Come—have me slain quickly upon Rāma, O Rāvaṇa. Unite husband and wife;
  accomplish the highest ‘good’ (as you conceive it).
'32': >-
  Join my head to his head, and my body to his body. I shall follow after Rāvaṇa
  the course of my great-souled husband.
'33': >-
  Thus, tormented by the heat of grief, the large-eyed daughter of Janaka
  wailed; she beheld her husband’s head and the bow as well.
'34': >-
  While Sītā was lamenting thus there, a rākṣasa, stationed within the troop,
  approached with folded hands (in reverence).
'35': >-
  Saluting him and seeking favor, saying, “Be victorious, O noble lord,” he
  reported that Prahasta, the commander of the host, had arrived.
'36': >-
  “Prahasta, along with all the ministers, has come into your presence; desiring
  an audience with you, O lord, I have been dispatched (to inform you).”
'37': >-
  “Surely, O great king—endowed with royal dignity and forbearance—there is some
  urgent business. Grant them an audience.”
'38': >-
  Hearing this report from the rākṣasa, Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa) left the Aśoka grove
  and went to see his counsellors.
'39': >-
  And having, with his ministers, duly considered the whole of what was to be
  done, he entered the assembly-hall and arranged his plans, understanding the
  prowess of Rāma.
'40': >-
  That head and that excellent bow vanished from sight immediately after
  Rāvaṇa’s departure.
'41': >-
  Then the lord of the rākṣasas, together with those ministers of dreadful
  prowess, deliberated upon a decision regarding Rāma’s affair (the course to be
  taken against Rāma).
'42': >-
  To all the chiefs of the forces, standing not far away—well-wishers—Rāvaṇa,
  lord of the rākṣasas, spoke in a voice like Time itself:
'43': >-
  “Quickly, with the resounding of kettledrums and the clear blare of trumpets,
  bring my armies together—no reason need be stated (no excuses are to be
  given)!”
'44': >-
  Then, accepting that command with “So be it,” the messengers at once hastily
  assembled the great host, and, when it had gathered, reported it to their
  lord, eager for battle.
'45': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-second sarga in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “Sītā’s Lament.”
