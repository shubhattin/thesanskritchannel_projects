  Now, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  one-hundred-and-fourth canto, called “The Breaking of Rāvaṇa’s Spear (Śūla).”
'1': >-
  Then the wise Rāma, as though burning up the rākṣasas, was seized with a very
  great wrath. Seeing the face of that enraged Rāma, all beings trembled, and
  the earth itself quaked.
'2': >-
  Mountains—like lions and tigers—shook, and the trees upon them swayed; and the
  ocean too, lord of rivers, became violently agitated.
'3': >-
  Harsh-thundering donkeys brayed, and in the sky fierce clouds gathered; and
  ominous, unnatural portents, roaring on every side, moved about all around.
'4': >-
  Beholding Rāma exceedingly wrathful, and those dreadful portents as well, all
  beings were stricken with terror; fear came upon Rāvaṇa.
'5': >-
  Then, stationed in their aerial cars, the gods, the gandharvas, and great
  serpents; the ṛṣis, the dānavas and daityas; and Garuḍa and other sky-ranging
  beings—
'6': >-
  —beheld that battle, like the very dissolution of the worlds, as the two
  heroes fought, with many terrible weapons.
'7': >-
  All the gods and the asuras, having entered into contention, watching that
  great war, spoke words with devotion, as though exultant.
'8': >-
  The asuras, standing together, cried, “Daśagrīva will be victorious!” But the
  gods said to Rāma again and again, “Victory to you!”
'9': >-
  Meanwhile, through rage at Rāghava, the wicked-souled Rāvaṇa, desiring to
  strike, laid his hand upon a mighty weapon.
'10': >-
  It was hard as a thunderbolt, of tremendous roar, a destroyer of all enemies,
  with spikes like mountain-peaks, terrible to behold and frightful even at the
  very sight.
'11': >-
  It seemed as though wreathed in smoke, sharp-pointed, like a mass of the fire
  at the end of the age—exceedingly dreadful, irresistible, hard to approach
  even by Death himself.
'12': >-
  A terror to all beings—rending and splitting—Rāvaṇa seized that spear, as
  though blazing with wrath.
'13': >-
  In battle, that mighty warrior, supremely enraged, took up that spear,
  surrounded in the combat by rākṣasa champions and their divisions.
'14': >-
  Lifting it up, the huge-bodied one gave a fearsome roar on the battlefield,
  his eyes reddened with fury, gladdening and exciting his own host.
'15': >-
  Then that dreadful cry of the lord of rākṣasas shook the earth, the sky, the
  quarters and the intermediate directions as well.
'16': >-
  By that roar of that evil-minded one—by that thunder of his vast frame—all
  beings trembled, and even the ocean was greatly disturbed.
'17': >-
  Taking up that mighty spear, Rāvaṇa of great prowess roared with a very loud
  sound, and then spoke harshly to Rāma:
'18': >-
  “This spear, hard as a thunderbolt, is raised by me in wrath against you, O
  Rāma. It will at once take away the life of you who fight with your brother as
  your ally.”
'19': >-
  “Today, after the heroes of the rākṣasas have been slain at the forefront of
  the army, having killed you—boaster of battle—I shall swiftly make things
  even.”
'20': >-
  “Stand now; I will slay you with this spear, O Rāghava!” Saying so, the lord
  of rākṣasas hurled that spear.
'21': >-
  Released from Rāvaṇa’s hand, wreathed as with a garland of lightning,
  furnished with eight bells and giving a mighty sound, it shone as it sped
  through the sky.
'22': >-
  Seeing that blazing spear of dreadful aspect, the valiant Rāghava, drawing his
  bow, discharged sharp arrows.
'23': >-
  With a torrent of shafts, Rāghava checked it as it rushed on—just as Vāsava
  (Indra) checks the uprising fire at the end of the age with floods of water.
'24': >-
  But Rāvaṇa’s great spear burned up those arrows shot from Rāma’s bow, like a
  fire consuming moths.
'25': >-
  Seeing those arrows in midair reduced to ash and pulverized by contact with
  the spear, Rāghava was seized with wrath.
'26': >-
  Then, supremely enraged, Rāghava, delight of the Raghu line, seized that
  divine javelin (śakti) brought by Mātali and approved by Vāsava (Indra).
'27': >-
  Poised by the mighty-armed one, that javelin, with a sound like bells, blazed
  with radiance and seemed to set the sky aflame—like a meteor at the end of the
  age.
'28': >-
  Hurled, it struck that spear of the lord of rākṣasas. Split by the javelin,
  the great spear fell down, its brilliance lost.
'29': >-
  Then Rāma, with sharp, very swift, high-impetus arrows—straight-flying and
  like thunderbolts—pierced the exceedingly swift horses of his chariot.
'30': >-
  Then, fully intent, Rāghava pierced Rāvaṇa in the chest with keen arrows, and
  struck his forehead with three barbed shafts.
'31': >-
  Wounded by arrows in every limb, blood streaming from his body, the lord of
  rākṣasas, standing amid his host, appeared like a blossoming aśoka tree.
'32': >-
  The lord of night-roamers, his body pierced through by Rāma’s arrows and
  drenched with blood from his wounds, fell into weariness in the midst of the
  assembly of warriors—and at that very time his wrath blazed up exceedingly.
'33': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-fourth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the
  venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, called “The Breaking of
  Rāvaṇa’s Spear (Śūla).”
