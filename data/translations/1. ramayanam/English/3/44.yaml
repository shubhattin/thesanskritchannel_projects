  Now begins the Forty-fourth Sarga of the Aranya-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, entitled “The Deception of Maricha.”
'1': >-
  Thus, having instructed his brother, the delight of the Raghus—Rama of great
  splendor—girt on his sword, whose hilt was made of gold.
'2': >-
  Then that heroic one took up his triple-curved bow, which was as it were his
  own ornament, and fastening on two quivers, set forth with lofty prowess.
'3': >-
  Seeing that lordly prince advancing, the king of the forest (the deer)
  vanished in fear, and again came into view.
'4': >-
  With sword bound on and bow in hand, Rama ran in the direction where the deer
  fled; and he beheld it ahead, as though shining in its form.
'5': >-
  In that great forest, bow in hand, he kept looking and looking at it as it
  ran—like a portent that had gone too far—drawing him on through desire again
  and again.
'6': >-
  Now appearing alarmed and bewildered, leaping as though into the sky, it was
  seen in certain tracts of the forest, and in others it became unseen even
  while being seen.
'7': >-
  Like the autumnal circle of the moon veiled by scattered clouds, it was
  glimpsed for but a moment, and again shone forth from afar.
'8': >-
  By this alternation of appearing and disappearing, it drew Raghava onward; and
  Maricha, having assumed the state of a deer, went far away from that
  hermitage.
'9': >-
  But the son of Kakutstha grew angry, and, helplessly deluded by it, at last,
  utterly wearied, he halted, taking refuge in the shade upon the grassy ground.
'10': >-
  Then the night-ranger, wearing a deer’s form, drove him into a frenzy; and,
  surrounded by other deer, it appeared again not far away.
'11': >-
  Seeing him eager to seize it, it ran toward him once more; that very instant,
  out of terror, it vanished again.
'12': >-
  Again, from a distance, it came out from a clump of trees; and Rama of great
  radiance, resolved to slay it, beheld it.
'13': >-
  Then Raghava, enraged, again drew forth an arrow there—one that shone like the
  rays of the sun, blazing, and fit for the subduer of foes.
'14': >-
  Fixing it upon his exceedingly firm bow, and drawing it back powerfully, that
  mighty one aimed at that very deer, as at a serpent hissing.
'15': >-
  He released a flaming, radiant weapon, fashioned by Brahma; that peerless
  arrow, piercing through the body of the deer-form,
'16': >-
  split Maricha’s very heart, like a thunderbolt; and leaping up the height of a
  palm-tree, he fell down, grievously tormented.
'17': >-
  With little life remaining, he uttered a dreadful cry upon the earth; and as
  Maricha was dying, he abandoned that artificial body.
'18': >-
  Recalling the words (spoken earlier), that rakshasa reflected: “By what means
  could Lakshmana be sent away from here, so that Ravana might carry Sita off in
  that emptiness?”
'19': >-
  Knowing the time to be ripe, he then made that cry—exactly like Raghava’s—‘Ha,
  Sita! Ha, Lakshmana!’
'20': >-
  For, pierced in a vital spot by that incomparable arrow, he cast aside the
  deer-form and assumed the form of a rakshasa.
'21': >-
  As he abandoned life, Maricha made his body exceedingly huge; and seeing that
  rakshasa of dreadful aspect fallen upon the ground,
'22': >-
  Rama, beholding his limbs drenched in blood, writhing on the earth, went in
  his mind to Sita, remembering Lakshmana’s words.
'23': >-
  “This indeed is Maricha’s illusion, as Lakshmana had said before; and so it
  has come to pass today—this Maricha has been slain by me.
'24': >-
  Having cried out in a mighty voice, ‘Ha, Sita! Ha, Lakshmana!’ this rakshasa
  has died. On hearing it, what will Sita do?
'25': >-
  And Lakshmana of mighty arms will fall into a state of desire (to go forth),”
  —thinking thus, the righteous-souled Rama had the hairs upon his body thrill.
'26': >-
  Thereupon a fierce fear, born of despair, entered Rama—after slaying that
  rakshasa in deer-form and after hearing that cry.
'27': >-
  Having slain another spotted deer and taking its flesh, Raghava, hastening
  then, rushed straight toward Janasthana.
'28': >-
  Thus ends the Forty-fourth Sarga of the Aranya-kanda of the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the primeval epic, entitled “The Deception of Maricha.”
