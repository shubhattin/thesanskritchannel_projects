  Now begins the forty-fifth canto in the Bālakāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Arising of Nectar (Amṛta).”
'1': >-
  Hearing the words of Viśvāmitra, Rāghava, together with Lakṣmaṇa, was overcome
  with the greatest wonder; and then he spoke to Viśvāmitra.
'2': >-
  “Most marvelous indeed, O Brahman, is this supreme account related by you—both
  the sacred descent of the Gaṅgā and even the filling of the ocean.”
'3': >-
  “The night has passed for us as though it were but a moment, O subduer of
  foes, while we pondered, in its entirety, this whole narrative of yours.”
'4': >-
  Thus that entire night went by for me, together with Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), as I
  reflected upon your auspicious story, O Viśvāmitra.
'5': >-
  Then, at the stainless dawn, after completing his morning rites, Rāghava—the
  crusher of enemies—addressed Viśvāmitra, the ascetic rich in austerity, in
  these words:
'6': >-
  “The venerable night has passed, and we have heard what is most excellent to
  be heard. Let us cross the foremost of rivers, the holy stream that flows in
  three paths.”
'7': >-
  “This boat, having easily brought across the meritorious ascetics of righteous
  deeds, has come swiftly on learning that the venerable one has arrived here.”
'8': >-
  Hearing that utterance of the great-souled Rāghava, Kauśika (Viśvāmitra) had
  the crossing arranged for the assemblage of sages.
'9': >-
  Reaching the northern bank, and duly honoring the host of ṛṣis, they sat down
  on the bank of the Gaṅgā and beheld the spacious city of Viśālā.
'10': >-
  Then the foremost of sages promptly proceeded, together with Rāghava, to that
  delightful, divine city of Viśālā, resembling heaven.
'11': >-
  Thereupon Rāma, of great wisdom, with joined palms questioned the great sage
  Viśvāmitra about that excellent city of Viśālā.
'12': >-
  “Of what royal line is this city of Viśālā, O great sage? I desire to hear
  it—may good be yours; for great indeed is my curiosity.”
'13': >-
  Hearing that speech of Rāma, the best of sages began to relate the ancient
  history of Viśālā.
'14': >-
  “Listen, O Rāma, as I recount a tale of Śakra (Indra) that I have heard; and
  hear truly what took place in this land, O Rāghava.”
'15': >-
  “Formerly, in the Kṛtayuga, O Rāma, the sons of Diti were mighty in strength;
  and the blessed sons of Aditi were valorous, possessed of power, and firmly
  established in dharma.”
'16': >-
  “Then a thought arose in those great-souled beings, O tiger among men: ‘How
  may we become immortal, unaging, and free from disease?’”
'17': >-
  “As those wise ones pondered there, this resolve came to them: ‘Having churned
  the Milky Ocean, we shall obtain its essence indeed.’”
'18': >-
  “Then, having determined upon the churning, they made Vāsuki the rope, and
  making Mandara the churning-staff, those of immeasurable energy churned.”
'19': >-
  “And over a thousand years, the heads of that serpent-rope, emitting
  exceedingly deadly poison, struck the mountain with their fangs.”
'20': >-
  “Thereupon there sprang forth the great poison Hālāhala, blazing like fire; by
  it the entire world was scorched—gods, asuras, and men alike.”
'21': >-
  “Then the gods, seeking refuge, went to Mahādeva Śaṅkara—Rudra, Paśupati—and
  praised him, crying, ‘Save us, save us!’”
'22': >-
  “Thus addressed by the gods, the Lord—God of gods and sovereign—was present
  there; and then Hari, bearing conch and discus, manifested in that very
  place.”
'23': >-
  Smiling, Hari spoke to Rudra, the wielder of the trident, concerning that
  which had first arisen when the gods were churning.
'24': >-
  “This belongs to you, O best of the gods—since it has come forth before the
  gods. Having accepted the foremost worship in this rite, take up this poison,
  O Lord.”
'25': >-
  Having said this, the best of the gods vanished there itself—seeing the fear
  of the deities and having heard the words of the bearer of the Śārṅga bow.
'26': >-
  Then the terrible Hālāhala poison he took up as though it were nectar; and
  dismissing the gods, the Lord Hara departed.
'27': >-
  Then all the gods and asuras again churned, O joy of the Raghus; and the
  churning-mountain, the best of mountains, sank down into the netherworld.
'28': >-
  Then the gods, together with the Gandharvas, praised Madhusūdana: “You are the
  refuge of all beings, and especially of the dwellers in heaven.”
'29': >-
  “Protect us, O mighty-armed one; you ought to lift up the mountain.” Hearing
  this, Hṛṣīkeśa assumed the form of a tortoise.
'30': >-
  Placing the mountain upon his back, Hari lay there in the ocean; and Keśava,
  the soul of the worlds, pressed down the mountain’s summit with his hand.
'31': >-
  Standing amid the gods, the Supreme Person churned; and then, after a thousand
  years, there arose a person embodying the science of Ayurveda.
'32': >-
  That righteous-souled one emerged bearing staff and water-pot—first
  Dhanvantari by name; and there also arose the radiant Apsarases.
'33': >-
  From the churning of the waters themselves—from that essence—those excellent
  women sprang forth, O best of men; therefore they came to be called Apsarases.
'34': >-
  Sixty crores of those radiant Apsarases came into being; and countless, O
  Kakutstha, were those who were their attendants.
'35': >-
  But none of the gods or Dānavas accepted them. Precisely because they were not
  accepted, they are remembered as belonging to all in common.
'36': >-
  Then Varuṇa’s daughter, Vāruṇī, arose—most fortunate, O joy of the
  Raghus—seeking someone to accept her.
'37': >-
  The sons of Diti did not accept that daughter of Varuṇa, O Rāma; but the sons
  of Aditi, O hero, accepted her, blameless as she was.
'38': >-
  Therefore the Daityas became the asuras, and the sons of Aditi became the
  suras; and the suras were delighted and greatly rejoiced at accepting Vāruṇī.
'39': >-
  Then arose Uccaiḥśravas, the foremost of horses, and the jewel-gem Kaustubha,
  and likewise the excellent nectar, amṛta, O best of men.
'40': >-
  “Then, for the sake of that nectar, O Rāma, there occurred a great destruction
  of the race; and the sons of Aditi then fought with the sons of Diti.”
'41': >-
  All the asuras, together with the rākṣasas, came into unity. A most dreadful
  battle took place, O hero, one that bewildered the three worlds.
'42': >-
  When all had gone to ruin, then mighty Viṣṇu, assuming the enchanting illusion
  of Mohinī, swiftly carried off the nectar.
'43': >-
  Those who advanced facing Viṣṇu—the imperishable Supreme Person—were then
  crushed in battle by Viṣṇu, the all-powerful.
'44': >-
  The valiant sons of Aditi slew the sons of Diti in that terrible great war
  between the Daityas and Ādityas, with fierce intensity.
'45': >-
  Having slain the sons of Diti and having obtained sovereignty, Purandara
  (Indra) ruled the worlds in gladness—together with their hosts of sages and
  their assemblies of Cāraṇas.
'46': >-
  Thus ends the forty-fifth canto of the Bālakāṇḍa in the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Arising of Nectar (Amṛta).”
