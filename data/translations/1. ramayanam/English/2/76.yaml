  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  seventy-sixth chapter, named “The Funeral Rites of Daśaratha.”
'1': >-
  As Bharata, the son of Kaikeyī, was thus consumed by grief, Vasiṣṭha—best
  among speakers, the foremost sage in speech—addressed him.
'2': >-
  Enough of lamentation; be it well with you, illustrious prince. Since the
  proper time has come for the lord of men, perform fully the final rites that
  are due.
'3': >-
  Hearing Vasiṣṭha’s words, Bharata gathered firmness of mind; and, knowing
  dharma, he caused all the rites pertaining to the departed to be carried out.
'4': >-
  The king—drawn up from the oil with which he had been kept moist—was then laid
  upon the ground, his face retaining its hue, like one asleep, though he had
  departed from life.
'5': >-
  Placing him upon an excellent couch, adorned with many kinds of jewels, the
  son then bewailed Daśaratha, sorely afflicted with grief.
'6': >-
  “O king, what was this resolve of yours, while I was away and had not yet
  returned—to send into exile Rāma, the knower of dharma, and Lakṣmaṇa of great
  might?”
'7': >-
  “Where will you go, great king, abandoning this sorrowing people, bereft of
  the lion among men—Rāma—whose deeds are stainless and unwearied?”
'8': >-
  “O king, who will now provide the welfare and security of this city, when you
  have gone to heaven, my father, and when Rāma has taken refuge in the forest?”
'9': >-
  “The earth, like a widow, does not shine when bereft of you, O king; and to me
  the city appears like a night without the moon.”
'10': >-
  As Bharata lamented thus, his mind cast down, the great sage Vasiṣṭha again
  spoke words to him.
'11': >-
  “Those rites for the departed which must be done for this lord of the
  people—do them, O mighty-armed one, without distraction, without wavering.”
'12': >-
  “So be it,” said Bharata; honoring Vasiṣṭha’s command, he urged on all the
  priests—ṛtviks, purohitas, and ācāryas—on every side.
'13': >-
  Those who had first been brought out from the king’s fire-chamber were then
  borne along, as prescribed, by the officiating priests and sacrificers.
'14': >-
  Then, placing the king—whose consciousness had departed—upon a palanquin, the
  attendants, heavy-hearted and with throats choked by tears, carried him
  onward.
'15': >-
  Scattering gold and silver and garments of many kinds, the people went along
  the road in front of the king.
'16': >-
  Bringing sandalwood, aloe-resin, pine-wood, and padmaka, and also divine
  cedar, others likewise prepared the funeral pyre.
'17': >-
  Having there placed fragrances, both costly and simple, the priests then laid
  the lord of the earth in the midst of the pyre.
'18': >-
  Then, having offered the prescribed oblations into the fire, the priests
  performed the rites for him; and the Sāma-chanters sang there the Sāman hymns
  according to the śāstra.
'19': >-
  The king’s wives, conveyed in palanquins and vehicles as befitted them, then
  went forth from the city, surrounded by the elderly women.
'20': >-
  The priests circumambulated the king upon the fire-pyre, keeping it to their
  right; and the women, tormented by grief—Kausalyā at their head—were there.
'21': >-
  There was heard the cry of women, like that of female krauñcha-birds—pitiable,
  grievous, and timely—wailing by the thousand in their anguish.
'22': >-
  Then those noble ladies, weeping, bereft of self-control, and lamenting again
  and again, alighted from their vehicles onto the bank of the Sarayū.
'23': >-
  After offering the water-oblation, together with Bharata—the royal ladies, the
  ministers, and the priests—entered the city with eyes flooded with tears, and
  for ten days passed their time in sorrow upon the ground.
'24': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-sixth chapter of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the revered
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Funeral Rites of Daśaratha.”
