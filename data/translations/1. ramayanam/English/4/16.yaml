  Now begins the sixteenth chapter, named “The Slaying of Vāli,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa.
'1': >-
  As Tārā spoke thus—she whose face was like the lord of stars (the moon)—Vāli
  rebuked her and said these words:
'2': >-
  “Though my brother—especially as an enemy—roars forth in great fury, I shall
  endure it for some reason or other, O fair-faced one.”
'3': >-
  “For valiant heroes who have been assailed and who do not turn back in
  battles, O timid one, not brooking an affront is worse than death itself.”
'4': >-
  “I am not able to endure, in combat, the roar of Sugrīva—desirous of
  battle—whose neck is bent low and who advances in rage.”
'5': >-
  “And for my sake you should not grieve with regard to Rāghava. How could
  he—knowing dharma and being grateful—commit a sinful deed?”
'6': >-
  “Return, along with the women. Why do you follow me again? You have already
  shown friendship, and toward me you have displayed your devotion.”
'7': >-
  “I shall go and fight Sugrīva; abandon your agitation. I shall crush his
  pride, and yet he will not be separated from his life.”
'8': >-
  “Indeed, I shall do for him, as he stands upon the battlefield, what is
  desired: battered by trees and blows of my fists, he will be forced to
  retreat.”
'9': >-
  “That evil-minded one, swollen with arrogance, will not bear it. O Tārā, you
  have rendered help; friendship has been shown toward me.”
'10': >-
  “You are adjured upon my very life: turn back with the people. Enough—having
  conquered that brother of mine in battle, I shall return.”
'11': >-
  But Tārā—sweet of speech—embraced Vāli; and weeping softly, she walked around
  him, keeping him to her right, in reverential circumambulation.
'12': >-
  Then, having performed rites for auspiciousness, that lady—versed in sacred
  counsel and longing for victory—entered the inner apartments along with the
  women, overwhelmed by sorrow.
'13': >-
  When Tārā had entered her own dwelling with the women, Vāli, enraged, went out
  from the city, breathing like a mighty serpent.
'14': >-
  Sighing forth, filled with great wrath, Vāli of exceeding speed cast his gaze
  in every direction, yearning for the sight of his enemy.
'15': >-
  Then that illustrious one saw Sugrīva—golden-tawny in hue—well-girt, standing
  firm, blazing like fire.
'16': >-
  Seeing Sugrīva standing ready, the great-armed Vāli—supremely wrathful—tightly
  wrapped his garment about himself.
'17': >-
  Thus Vāli, tightly clad, the powerful one, raising his clenched fist, went
  straight toward Sugrīva to fight, having resolved upon the moment.
'18': >-
  Lifting up his tightly clenched fist and coming with still greater fury,
  Sugrīva too advanced, aiming at Vāli who wore a golden garland.
'19': >-
  Vāli, his eyes reddened by anger, addressed Sugrīva—skilled in battle—who was
  rushing upon him with great speed, saying:
'20': >-
  “This fist is vast, tightly bound, with fingers firmly set; released by me
  with force, it will depart taking away your life-breaths.”
'21': >-
  Thus addressed, Sugrīva, enraged, replied to Vāli: “And let this fist of
  yours, carrying away your life-breaths, fall upon your head!”
'22': >-
  Struck by him, Vāli, wrathful, rushed forward with speed; he became one who
  spewed blood, like a mountain riven and pained.
'23': >-
  But Sugrīva, fearlessly tearing up a śāla tree with his might, struck Vāli on
  his limbs; Vāli was like a great mountain smitten by a thunderbolt.
'24': >-
  Broken by the tree and reeling from the blow of the śāla, he was like a boat
  in the ocean—laden down by heavy weight—tossed along with its cargo.
'25': >-
  Those two, of dreadful strength and prowess, swift as Suparṇa (Garuḍa), grown
  great and of terrible forms, were like the moon and the sun in the sky.
'26': >-
  Slayers of foes, seeking one another’s openings, then Vāli increased still
  more—endowed with strength and valor.
'27': >-
  Sugrīva, the mighty son of the Sun, began to wane; his pride was shattered by
  Vāli, and Sugrīva’s prowess grew feeble.
'28': >-
  Enraged against Vāli, he (Sugrīva) displayed to Rāghava his might—by trees
  with branches and by peaks, and by nails like the edges of countless
  thunderbolts.
'29': >-
  With fists, knees, feet, and arms again and again, their battle became
  dreadful—like that of Vṛtra and Vāsava (Indra).
'30': >-
  Smeared with blood, those two forest-roaming monkeys fought on, like clouds
  thundering with mighty sounds, threatening one another.
'31': >-
  Then Rāghava, watching again and again, saw Sugrīva—the lord of monkeys—being
  worsted, and looking about toward the quarters.
'32': >-
  Then mighty Rāma, of great splendor, seeing the lord of monkeys in distress,
  fixed his gaze upon an arrow, desiring the death of Vāli.
'33': >-
  Then, placing on the bow an arrow like a venomous serpent, he drew and filled
  that bow, like Death filling the wheel of time.
'34': >-
  By the sharp twang of his bowstring, the lords of winged chariots (birds) were
  frightened; and the deer too fled in all directions, as if bewildered at the
  end of an age.
'35': >-
  Released by Rāghava, that great arrow—thundering like a thunderbolt and
  resembling a blazing lightning-flash—was driven into Vāli’s chest.
'36': >-
  Thereupon, struck with speed by that mighty, valorous king of monkeys, Vāli
  fell upon the ground.
'37': >-
  Like Indra’s banner cast down upon the earth on the full-moon day in the month
  of Āśvayuja—bereft of glory and senseless—Vāli, his throat choked with tears,
  in a distressed voice, spoke slowly.
'38': >-
  That best of men (Rāma) released the best of arrows—like the wrath of Time at
  the end of an age—adorned with gold and silver, blazing, crushing foes, as
  Rudra sends forth from his mouth a fire with smoke.
'39': >-
  Then, drenched with streams of blood flowing like water, like a blossoming
  aśoka tree shaken down by the wind, Vāsava’s son (Vāli), senseless in battle,
  fell to the earth like a toppled banner of Indra.
'40': >-
  Thus ends the sixteenth chapter, named “The Slaying of Vāli,” in the
  Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
