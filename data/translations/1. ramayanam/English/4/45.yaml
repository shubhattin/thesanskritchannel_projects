  Now begins the forty-fifth canto, named “The Mustering and Deployment of the
  Vanara Forces,” in Kishkindha Kanda of the glorious Valmiki Ramayana.
'1': >-
  Then Sugriva, the bull among the vanaras and their king, summoned all the
  monkey-heroes, and addressed the entire assembly for the accomplishment of
  Rama’s purpose.
'2': >-
  “Thus must the matter be searched out by you, O foremost of vanaras.” Having
  understood the stern command of their lord, those leaders among the monkeys
  set their minds accordingly.
'3': >-
  Covering the earth like a swarm of locusts, they set forth. Rama, along with
  Lakshmana, made his abode upon that Prasravana mountain.
'4': >-
  Awaiting that month—fixed for the finding of Sita—(Rama remained there), while
  the hosts set out, and the delightful northern quarter, encircled by the king
  of mountains, became the object of their going.
'5': >-
  Then the heroic vanara of immense strength set out at once; and Vinata, the
  leader of a monkey-host, proceeded toward the eastern direction.
'6': >-
  Hanuman, the son of the Wind-god, accompanied by Tara, Angada, and the rest,
  marched as a leader of monkey-hosts toward the southern quarter, famed as the
  region traversed by Agastya.
'7': >-
  And Sushena, lord of the vanaras—a tiger among monkeys—set forth toward the
  dreadful western direction, the quarter protected by Varuna.
'8': >-
  Thereafter the king, having dispatched (the forces) toward all the directions
  in the proper manner, the valiant commander of the monkey-army rejoiced, being
  content and happy at heart.
'9': >-
  Thus urged on by the king, all the leaders of the vanara hosts, each having
  chosen his appointed direction, set out swiftly toward his own quarter.
'10': >-
  Roaring and bellowing, shouting and thundering, those mighty vanaras sprang
  forward—leaping, running, and raising clamorous cries as they went.
'11': >-
  Thus urged on by the king, all the leaders of the vanara hosts (cried out),
  “We shall bring back Sita, and we shall slay Ravana as well!”
'12': >-
  “I alone shall kill Ravana when he comes within reach in battle; and then,
  tearing (Sita) away at once, I shall carry off the daughter of Janaka!”
'13': >-
  “Let the rest of you stand fast today, trembling and wearied by exertion; I
  alone shall bring Janaki back, even from the netherworld!”
'14': >-
  “I shall shatter trees; I shall split mountains; I shall rend the earth; I
  shall churn and upheave the oceans!”
'15': >-
  “I shall leap a distance measured in yojanas—of this there is no doubt. A full
  hundred yojanas, and more than a hundred besides, can I traverse!”
'16': >-
  “Whether on the surface of the earth, or in the sea, or upon mountains, or in
  forests, or even in the very midst of the nether regions—my course is not
  obstructed anywhere.”
'17': >-
  Thus, there and then, each vanara, intoxicated with his own strength, spoke
  such words in the presence of that monkey-king (Sugriva).
'18': >-
  Thus ends the forty-fifth canto, named “The Mustering and Deployment of the
  Vanara Forces,” in Kishkindha Kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the primeval
  epic.
