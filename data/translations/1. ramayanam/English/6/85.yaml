  Now begins the eighty-fifth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The March to Nikumbhilā.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words of his, Rāghava—afflicted and worn by grief—could not
  clearly comprehend what had been spoken by that rākṣasa.
'2': >-
  Then Rāma, the conqueror of hostile cities, steadying himself with fortitude,
  spoke to Vibhīṣaṇa who sat near him, in the presence of the monkeys.
'3': >-
  “O lord of the rākṣasas, Vibhīṣaṇa, the words that were spoken to you—again I
  wish to hear them. Tell me what you intend to say.”
'4': >-
  Hearing Rāghava’s speech, Vibhīṣaṇa—skilled in replying with fitting
  words—then spoke again these words.
'5': >-
  “As you commanded, O mighty-armed one, regarding the establishing of
  detachments—so indeed, O hero, it has been carried out immediately after your
  order.”
'6': >-
  “All those divisions of troops have been distributed all around; and the
  leaders of the bands have been stationed as is proper, each according to his
  allotted division.”
'7': >-
  “Further, O great lord, there is yet something I must submit—hear it. While
  you are tormented without cause, our hearts too are tormented.”
'8': >-
  “Cast off, O king, this sorrow—this vain anguish that has arisen; let this
  anxiety be abandoned, for it increases the joy of the enemy.”
'9': >-
  “Let effort be undertaken, O hero; let cheer be embraced. If Sītā is to be
  regained by you, then the night-rangers too must be slain.”
'10': >-
  “O delight of the Raghu line, I shall tell you—listen to my wholesome counsel:
  let Saumitri go forth with a great force surrounding him.”
'11': >-
  “Let the great bowman, victorious in battle, go to Nikumbhilā to slay Rāvaṇi
  in combat—slaying him with arrows released from the circle of his bow, like
  venom in their bite, like poisonous serpents.”
'12': >-
  “For that hero, by austerity and by a boon from the Self-born Lord, has
  obtained the missile called Brahmaśiras; and he has horses that can go
  wherever he wills.”
'13': >-
  “He, it is said, has reached Nikumbhilā together with his army. If he should
  rise up after accomplishing his rite, then know all of us to be slain.”
'14': >-
  “But if the enemy is reached at Nikumbhilā while he has not yet kindled the
  sacred fire—then, O Indra’s foe, if he should slay you who are like one come
  as an aggressor, that indeed will be his death.”
'15': >-
  “Such is the boon granted, O mighty-armed one, by the Lord of all the worlds;
  thus, O king, the death of that intelligent one has been ordained in this
  manner.”
'16': >-
  “Therefore, O Rāma, dispatch a mighty force for the slaying of Indrajit. When
  he is slain, know Rāvaṇa too to be as good as slain, together with the circle
  of his friends.”
'17': >-
  Hearing Vibhīṣaṇa’s words, Rāma then spoke: “I know the illusion of that
  fierce one, O you whose valor is true.”
'18': >-
  “For he is learned in Brahmā-weapons, wise, greatly skilled in magic, and very
  strong; in battle he throws even the gods—together with Varuṇa—into
  bewilderment.”
'19': >-
  “As that greatly renowned warrior moves through the sky in his chariot, his
  course cannot be discerned—like that of the sun when the heavens are
  overspread with clouds.”
'20': >-
  But Rāghava, knowing the power of illusion of that wicked-souled foe, spoke
  these words to Lakṣmaṇa, who was endowed with glory.
'21': >-
  “Lakṣmaṇa, go—surrounded by the entire force of the king of monkeys, together
  with the leaders of the troops, with Hanumān at their head.”
'22': >-
  “And, surrounded also by the army with Jāmbavān, the lord of bears, slay that
  son of the rākṣasa-king, possessed of illusory strength and power.”
'23': >-
  “This great-souled rākṣasa, accompanied by his counselors—Vibhīṣaṇa, who is
  well-acquainted with his spells—will follow behind you.”
'24': >-
  Hearing Rāghava’s command, Lakṣmaṇa—together with Vibhīṣaṇa—took up an
  excellent bow, he of dreadful prowess.
'25': >-
  Armed and mail-clad, bearing a sword and quiver, holding his bow in his left
  hand, Saumitrī touched Rāma’s feet and, delighted, spoke.
'26': >-
  “Today, the arrows released from my bow, piercing Rāvaṇi, shall swoop upon
  Laṅkā—like swans descending upon a lotus-lake.”
'27': >-
  “Today indeed, my arrows—shot from the great bowstring—shall shatter the body
  of that fierce one, rending him and tearing him apart.”
'28': >-
  Having spoken thus before his radiant elder brother, Lakṣmaṇa, desiring the
  slaying of Rāvaṇi, set out swiftly.
'29': >-
  Having bowed to the feet of his guru and also made circumambulation, he
  proceeded toward Nikumbhilā—the sacred precinct guarded by Rāvaṇi.
'30': >-
  The valiant prince Lakṣmaṇa went swiftly, together with Vibhīṣaṇa; and, with
  auspicious rites performed for his journey by his brother, he departed in
  haste.
'31': >-
  Hanumān, surrounded by many thousands of monkeys, and Vibhīṣaṇa with his
  ministers, went swiftly along with Lakṣmaṇa.
'32': >-
  Encompassed on all sides by the great monkey army moving with speed, he saw
  also the force of the king of bears standing arrayed on the path.
'33': >-
  Having traveled a long distance, Saumitrī, gladdening his allies, beheld from
  afar the host of the rākṣasa lord, drawn up in battle formation.
'34': >-
  Reaching the place with bow in hand, the foe-subduer—the scion who delights
  the Raghus—stood, adopting the disciplined method as ordained, intent on
  victory.
'35': >-
  The valiant prince entered on—together with Vibhīṣaṇa, and with the hero
  Aṅgada, and with the son of the Wind as well.
'36': >-
  He penetrated that dense forest of banners—shining with diverse, spotless
  weapons—along with the great chariot-warriors: the enemy host, exceedingly
  terrible, of immeasurable speed, like darkness itself.
'37': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-fifth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The March to Nikumbhilā.”
