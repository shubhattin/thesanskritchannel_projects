  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Bālakāṇḍa, begins the
  seventy-fourth canto, named “The Confrontation with Jāmadagnya (Paraśurāma).”
'1': >-
  When the night had passed, the great sage Viśvāmitra, having taken leave of
  those two kings, went toward the northern mountain.
'2': >-
  After Viśvāmitra had departed, King Daśaratha, having also taken leave of
  Vaideha—the lord of Mithilā—quickly set out and returned to his own city.
'3': >-
  Then the king of the Videhas, the sovereign of Mithilā, bestowed abundant
  maiden-gifts: many hundreds of thousands of cows.
'4': >-
  He gave also the finest woollen blankets, garments of linen, and crores of
  cloths; and a splendidly adorned host of elephants, horses, chariots, and
  foot-soldiers, of divine appearance.
'5': >-
  He gave for those maidens a hundred maidservants, together with the best of
  male servants; and also gold and precious gold-ornaments, pearls, and coral.
'6': >-
  The king, greatly delighted, bestowed this unsurpassed maiden-gift. Having
  given gifts of many kinds, and after duly taking leave of the monarch,
'7': >-
  the lord of Mithilā entered his own dwelling in Mithilā. And the king of
  Ayodhyā too, together with his noble sons, set forth,
'8': >-
  placing all the ṛṣis in the forefront, and went on with his forces and
  attendants. As that tiger among men—Rāghava—went forth accompanied by the
  assemblies of ṛṣis,
'9': >-
  terrible cries of birds were uttered on every side; and all the beasts of the
  earth were seen moving in a clockwise circuit (to the right).
'10': >-
  Seeing those omens, the tiger among kings questioned Vasiṣṭha: “These birds
  are inauspicious and dreadful, and the beasts too are circling to the right—
'11': >-
  why is it that my heart trembles, and my mind sinks into dejection?” Hearing
  these words of King Daśaratha, the great ṛṣi
'12': >-
  spoke gentle and sweet speech: “Hear what fruit this will bear. A terrible
  danger has arisen—foretold from the mouths of birds by divine portents.
'13': >-
  Yet these beasts are bringing pacification; therefore let this distress be
  cast away.” While they were speaking thus there, a wind suddenly arose,
'14': >-
  shaking the entire earth and bringing down great trees. The sun was veiled in
  darkness, and none could discern the directions.
'15': >-
  Everything was covered with ashes, and that army seemed as though bewildered.
  Vasiṣṭha, the other ṛṣis, and the king with his sons then—
'16': >-
  all remained as if still conscious, while everything else appeared as though
  insentient. In that dreadful darkness, the host stood as though blanketed in
  ashes.
'17': >-
  Then the king beheld the Bhārgava, Jāmadagnya—the crusher of kings—of fearsome
  aspect, wearing a great circle of matted locks.
'18': >-
  He was unassailable like Mount Kailāsa, unbearable like the fire of Time;
  blazing with splendour, he was hard for common men to gaze upon.
'19': >-
  With an axe slung upon his shoulder, and a bow like a mass of lightning,
  grasping also a fierce arrow—like Śiva, the slayer of Tripura—
'20': >-
  beholding him, of dreadful appearance, blazing like a fire, the brāhmaṇa sages
  headed by Vasiṣṭha—devoted to japa and homa—
'21': >-
  all the gathered munis spoke among themselves: “Surely, still enraged by his
  father’s slaying, will he not seek to destroy the kṣatriya race?”
'22': >-
  “Having formerly slain the kṣatriyas, his wrath and fever have departed. It is
  not indeed his intention to undertake once again the extermination of the
  kṣatriyas.”
'23': >-
  Having spoken thus, the ṛṣis took up the offerings of honour (arghya) and
  addressed the terrible-looking Bhārgava with sweet words, saying, “Rāma,
  Rāma!”
'24': >-
  After receiving that worship offered by the ṛṣis, the mighty one—Rāma
  Jāmadagnya—spoke to Rāma, the son of Daśaratha.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-fourth canto, named “The Confrontation with Jāmadagnya,”
  in the Bālakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
