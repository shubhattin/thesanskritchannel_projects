  Now, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, is the
  nineteenth chapter, called “Rāma’s Vow.”
'1': >-
  Hearing that unpleasing utterance of Kaikeyī—like unto death itself—Rāma, the
  slayer of foes, did not waver; and he spoke these words to her:
'2': >-
  “So be it. I shall depart hence and dwell in the forest, wearing matted locks
  and bark-garments, upholding the king’s pledge.
'3': >-
  Yet this I wish to know: for what reason does the king, that unassailable
  crusher of enemies, not greet me as before?
'4': >-
  “O queen, you should not give way to anger; I speak this in your presence. I
  shall go to the forest, clad in bark and bearing matted hair—be you fully
  pleased.
'5': >-
  “When urged, in trust and without hesitation, by a beneficent preceptor—by my
  father, the grateful king—why should I not do what is dear to him?
'6': >-
  “Only one false and painful thought burns my heart: that the king himself did
  not tell me of Bharata’s consecration.
'7': >-
  “Indeed, I—unbidden—would gladly give to my brother Bharata Sītā, the kingdom,
  my cherished life-breaths, and all my wealth.
'8': >-
  “How much more, then, when enjoined by the lord among men—my own father
  himself—while I maintain my vow for the sake of fulfilling your desire?
'9': >-
  “Therefore, reassure that modest king. What is this, that the lord of earth,
  with eyes fixed upon the ground, slowly lets tears fall?
'10': >-
  “Let messengers go at once to bring Bharata today itself, from his maternal
  uncle’s house, by the king’s command, with horses of swift speed.
'11': >-
  “As for me, I shall indeed hasten to the Daṇḍaka forest, without deliberation,
  to abide there for fourteen years, in obedience to my father’s word.
'12': >-
  Kaikeyī, delighted on hearing those words of Rāma, and trusting in his
  immediate departure, urged the Rāghava to make haste.
'13': >-
  “So be it. Messengers will go with horses of swift speed to bring Bharata back
  here from his maternal uncle’s family—men sent for that purpose.
'14': >-
  “In my judgment, O Rāma, it is fitting that you, being eager, should not be
  delayed. Therefore, you ought to go quickly from here to the forest.
'15': >-
  “That the king, ashamed, does not himself speak to you—this is nothing at all,
  O best of men. Let not this anger be harbored; let it be set aside.
'16': >-
  “So long as you have not gone swiftly from this city to the forest, so long, O
  Rāma, your father will neither bathe nor eat.”
'17': >-
  Sighing, “Alas, how grievous!”, the king, overwhelmed with sorrow, swooned and
  fell upon that couch adorned with gold.
'18': >-
  Even Rāma, urged on by Kaikeyī, raised up the king; and like a horse struck
  with a whip, he made haste to go to the forest.
'19': >-
  Hearing that cruel saying of the ignoble woman, pregnant with harsh
  consequence, Rāma, freed from agitation, spoke these words to Kaikeyī:
'20': >-
  “O queen, I am not devoted to gain; I do not desire to live in the world for
  the sake of worldly ends. Know me to be like the ṛṣis, established in
  stainless dharma.
'21': >-
  “Whatever, in any manner, can be done by me to please the venerable king—even
  by abandoning my very life—surely that has been done.”
'22': >-
  “For there is no practice of dharma greater than this: service to one’s
  father, and the carrying out of his word.”
'23': >-
  “Even though you had not spoken it, merely by the word of the king—and by your
  own utterance—I shall dwell in the lonely forest for fourteen years.
'24': >-
  “Surely, O Kaikeyī, you expect no virtue in me at all, since you—though the
  king’s principal queen—spoke to the king as you did.”
'25': >-
  “When I have taken leave of my mother and have persuaded and consoled Sītā,
  then today itself I shall depart to the great forest of the Daṇḍakas.
'26': >-
  “Let Bharata guard the kingdom and serve his father as is proper; so too
  should you act—for that is the eternal dharma.”
'27': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, his father fell into intense grief; and, unable to speak
  through sorrow, he wept aloud with a mighty sound.
'28': >-
  Then that greatly radiant Rāma, having bowed to the feet of the king—his
  father—who had become unconscious, and also (to those) of Kaikeyī, that
  ignoble woman, went forth.
'29': >-
  Rāma, having made circumambulation of his father and of Kaikeyī, departed from
  that inner palace and beheld his own circle of well-wishers.
'30': >-
  With eyes filled with tears, Lakṣmaṇa followed behind him—exceedingly
  enraged—he who was the delight and increaser of Sumitrā’s joy.
'31': >-
  Having circumambulated the consecration-implements, Rāma proceeded slowly,
  with a lingering look, not letting his gaze waver therefrom.
'32': >-
  And the loss of the kingdom did not diminish his great splendor—just as the
  waning of the cool-rayed moon does not take away its loveliness, for he is the
  beloved of the world.
'33': >-
  In him—who desired to go to the forest and to renounce the earth—no
  disturbance of mind could be discerned, as in one who surpasses all the
  worlds.
'34': >-
  He declined the auspicious royal umbrella and the beautifully adorned fans;
  dismissing his own attendants, the chariot, and likewise the townsmen and the
  people,
'35': >-
  bearing grief within his mind, restraining his senses, that self-possessed
  Rāma entered the palace—to announce what was unpleasing to his mother.
'36': >-
  All his illustrious kinsmen and attendants—of that splendid, truth-speaking
  prince—could not perceive on Rāma’s face any change of expression at all.
'37': >-
  And that mighty-armed, self-controlled one did not abandon the joy that was
  natural to him—like the autumn moon, with fully risen rays, not leaving its
  native radiance.
'38': >-
  With sweet speech, Rāma honored everyone; and that righteous-souled, greatly
  renowned one entered into his mother’s presence.
'39': >-
  His brother, the son of Sumitrā—of vast valor—attaining equality with him in
  virtues, followed after, holding within himself the sorrow that had befallen
  his brother.
'40': >-
  Entering the palace that was exceedingly filled with joy, and observing that
  reversal of fortune that had befallen her, Rāma showed no outward change
  there, for he feared distressing his well-wishers by (displaying) his own
  misfortune.
'41': >-
  Thus ends the nineteenth chapter in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “Rāma’s Vow.”
