'0': >-
  Now begins the thirty-third sarga of the Kishkindha-kanda in the sacred
  Valmiki Ramayana, entitled “Tara’s Words of Pacification.”
'1': >-
  Then Lakshmana—the slayer of enemy-heroes—having been thus instructed, entered
  that delightful cavern-city Kishkindha, in obedience to Rama’s command.
'2': >-
  There, at the gateway, stood monkeys of विशाल frame and great strength; on
  seeing Lakshmana, they all stood with joined palms in reverence.
'3': >-
  But seeing that son of Dasharatha breathing hard and wrathful, the monkeys
  were terrified, and none dared to obstruct him.
'4': >-
  He then beheld a vast cavern, resplendent and divine—adorned with gems,
  charming, and set with groves abloom with flowers.
'5': >-
  It was crowded with mansions and palatial edifices, decorated with many kinds
  of precious stones, and beautified by flowering trees bearing fruits that
  grant every desired pleasure.
'6': >-
  It was further adorned by monkeys able to assume forms at will, along with
  sons of Devas and Gandharvas—wearing divine garlands and garments, and
  pleasing to behold.
'7': >-
  It was perfumed with the fragrances of sandal, agaru, and lotus, and its great
  avenues were enlivened by the delights of strong liquors and honeyed drinks.
'8': >-
  Raghava saw there multi-storied palaces resembling the Vindhya and Meru
  mountains, and also crystal-clear streams flowing down the heights.
'9': >-
  He saw the charming residences of Angada, and of Mainda and Dvivida; and of
  Gavaya, Gavaksha, Gaja, and Sharabha.
'10': >-
  And of Vidyunmali, Sampati, Suryaksha, and Hanuman; and of Virabahu, Subahu,
  and also the great-souled Nala.
'11': >-
  And of Kumuda, Sushena, Tara’s son (Angada) and Jambavan likewise; and of
  Dadhivaktra, Nila, Supatala, and Sunetra.
'12': >-
  Along the royal road, Lakshmana beheld the principal mansions of these eminent
  leaders among the monkeys—great-souled ones—solid and splendid.
'13': >-
  They shone like pale clouds, were furnished with perfumes and garlands,
  abounded in wealth and grain, and were beautified with jewel-like women.
'14': >-
  Encircled by a pale-white mountain and difficult to assail, the delightful
  dwelling of the lord of monkeys appeared like the abode of Mahendra (Indra).
'15': >-
  With white palace-tops resembling the peaks of Kailasa, and adorned with
  flowering trees bearing fruits that fulfill every desire, it was exceedingly
  beautiful.
'16': >-
  There were wondrous trees, bestowed as it were by Mahendra, splendid and like
  dark-blue rainclouds, bearing divine flowers and fruits, with cool, pleasing
  shade.
'17': >-
  The doorway was guarded by powerful monkeys with weapons in hand; it was
  bright with divine garlands and had a splendid archway of heated gold.
'18': >-
  The mighty son of Sumitra entered Sugriva’s delightful house—unprevented—like
  the sun entering a great cloud-bank.
'19': >-
  The righteous Lakshmana saw seven enclosed courts, furnished with vehicles and
  seats; and he beheld the very large inner apartments, exceedingly
  well-guarded.
'20': >-
  Here and there it was filled with golden and silver couches, many excellent
  seats, and precious coverings spread upon them.
'21': >-
  As he continued entering, he constantly heard sweet sounds—music of stringed
  instruments and song—rich with melody, and measured in rhythm, beats, and
  syllables.
'22': >-
  In Sugriva’s palace the mighty Lakshmana saw many women of diverse forms,
  proud of their beauty and youth.
'23': >-
  He saw there noble ladies wearing garlands and wreaths, intent upon arranging
  excellent garlands, and adorned with the finest ornaments.
'24': >-
  Lakshmana also observed Sugriva’s attendants—neither immoderately sated nor
  overly agitated, and not meanly dressed.
'25': >-
  Hearing then the jingling of anklets and the resonant sound of girdles, the
  illustrious son of Sumitra became abashed.
'26': >-
  Yet, inflamed by the rush of anger, and hearing the sound of ornaments, the
  hero made his bowstring resound, filling the quarters with that sound.
'27': >-
  Thus demeaned by their conduct, the mighty-armed Lakshmana stood apart in a
  secluded place, possessed by Rama’s wrath.
'28': >-
  By that twang of the bow, Sugriva, lord of the monkeys, understood his
  arrival; terrified, he rose and moved from his excellent seat.
'29': >-
  “As Angada earlier informed me, this is clearly that Saumitrī—devoted to his
  brother—who has now arrived.”
'30': >-
  Thus informed by Angada, and recognizing the bowstring’s sound, the monkey
  (Sugriva) realized Lakshmana had come; and his face grew pale and dry.
'31': >-
  Then Sugriva, best among monkeys, spoke beneficial words to Tara—pleasing to
  behold—though his mind was shaken with fear and confusion, yet he was not
  distracted.
'32': >-
  “For what reason, O fair-browed one—he who is gentle by nature—has this
  younger brother of Raghava come as though in wrath?”
'33': >-
  “What do you perceive, O blameless one, to be the cause and seat of the
  prince’s anger? For the foremost of men does not grow angry without cause.”
'34': >-
  “If you understand that something disagreeable has been done by us to him,
  then, reflecting quickly with discernment, let it be told at once.”
'35': >-
  “Or else, O passionate lady, you yourself should go to see him, and by words
  joined with gentleness you should strive to appease him.”
'36': >-
  “At the sight of you, that pure-souled one will not, I think, continue in
  anger; for great men do not, at any time, behave harshly toward women.”
'37': >-
  “When you begin with pacifying words, his mind and senses will become serene;
  then I shall behold that lotus-eyed subduer of foes.”
'38': >-
  Then Tara—her eyes unsteady with intoxication, her long girdle-string and
  golden thread hanging down, her limbs marked with auspicious signs, her
  body-bend inclined—went to Lakshmana’s presence, stumbling as she moved.
'39': >-
  Beholding the wife of the monkey-lord, the great-souled Lakshmana stood with
  deliberate indifference; the son of the king among men lowered his face, and
  at the nearness of a woman his anger subsided.
'40': >-
  Freed from bashfulness due to the drinking, and encouraged by the graciousness
  of the prince’s look, Tara spoke to the king’s son a meaningful speech, bold
  with affection and fashioned as soothing counsel.
'41': >-
  “O son of the king among men, what is the root of this anger? Who does not
  stand by the command of your speech? Who, without fear, would try to
  extinguish a forest-fire rushing upon a woodland of dry trees?”
'42': >-
  Hearing her words, preceded by conciliation, Lakshmana, unalarmed, then spoke
  again—his gaze directed by affection and purpose.
'43': >-
  “Why is this lord of yours given over to desire, his grasp of dharma and artha
  lost? Though engaged in his lord’s welfare, you do not make him understand.”
'44': >-
  “Tara, he does not think of the kingdom’s needs, nor of us who are devoted to
  grief; together with ministers and council, he serves only pleasure.”
'45': >-
  “Having fixed four months as the term, the lord of monkeys—exalted in drunken
  pride—lets those months pass, sporting, and does not take notice.”
'46': >-
  “For the accomplishment of dharma and artha, such drinking is not praised;
  from drinking, artha and kama, and even dharma, decline.”
'47': >-
  “For one who fails to act when he must, there is first a great loss of dharma;
  and when a worthy friend is ruined, there is a great loss of artha as well.”
'48': >-
  “A friend is the best treasury of wealth and virtue, devoted to truth and
  dharma; but these two have been abandoned by him, and he is not established in
  righteousness.”
'49': >-
  “Therefore, when such a task is at hand, what remains to be done must be done
  by us; and you, who know the true nature of action, ought to declare what is
  to be done.”
'50': >-
  Hearing Lakshmana’s words—guided by discernment of dharma and artha, and sweet
  by nature—Tara, having understood the matter concerning the king of men’s
  purpose, spoke to him again with confidence.
'51': >-
  “O son of the king, this is not a time for anger; nor should anger be directed
  toward one’s own people. O hero, you ought to endure even this negligence of
  that person who is intent upon fulfilling your purpose and desire.”
'52': >-
  “How indeed would one excellent in virtues, O prince, become angry at one of
  inferior strength? Who like you would fall under the sway of anger—one whose
  nature is restrained, a product as it were of austerity?”
'53': >-
  “I know the anger of the kinsman of heroes among the monkeys; I know the
  timeliness demanded by the task. I know what has been done by you for our
  sake, and I also know what must now be done here.”
'54': >-
  “And I know as well the irresistible might of the son of the king among men
  (Rama), the best of men. I know, too, in what kind of person Sugriva is
  bound—today, attached to drinking and entangled by desire.”
'55': >-
  “Your understanding is not ruled by desire; but you, as it were, have come
  under the sway of anger. A man delighting in sensual pleasure does not truly
  consider place and time, nor what is dharma in its proper sense.”
'56': >-
  “Therefore, O slayer of enemy-heroes, forgive for now your brother—the lord of
  the monkey race—who is near to me, addicted to pleasure, and, through the
  onrush of desire, freed of shame.”
'57': >-
  “Even great sages, delighting in dharma and tapas, pursue desires as they
  arise, their delusion fastened upon them. How then would this
  monkey-king—restless by nature—not become attached to pleasures?”
'58': >-
  Having thus spoken this meaningful discourse, that lady monkey addressed the
  immeasurable Lakshmana once more; with a pained air, her eyes still wavering
  with intoxication, she spoke these words for her husband’s welfare.
'59': >-
  “O best of men, long ago Sugriva had commanded preparations for the
  accomplishment of your purpose—even though he is one who must still be guided
  by desire.”
'60': >-
  “For mighty monkeys, able to assume any form at will, have arrived—hundreds of
  thousands of crores—dwelling in many different mountains.”
'61': >-
  “Therefore come, O mighty-armed one; your good conduct has been preserved by
  you—unswerving, with friendly intent, as befits noble men in regard to looking
  upon another’s wife.”
'62': >-
  Permitted by Tara and urged by her with haste, the mighty-armed subduer of
  foes entered further into the inner chambers.
'63': >-
  Then he saw Sugriva seated upon a golden, excellent throne, spread with most
  precious coverings, radiant like the sun.
'64': >-
  Adorned with divine ornaments, splendid in form, renowned, wearing divine
  garlands and garments—hard to overcome like Mahendra himself—Sugriva appeared.
'65': >-
  Surrounded by women with divine ornaments and garlands, Lakshmana’s eyes,
  reddened with growing fury, became like the Destroyer (Yama/Antaka) in aspect.
'66': >-
  The hero Sugriva, of fine golden hue, seated upon an excellent throne and
  clasping Ruma tightly, beheld Saumitrī—undaunted in spirit; wide-eyed, he
  looked upon the wide-eyed Lakshmana.
'67': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-third sarga of the Kishkindha-kanda of the revered
  Valmiki Ramayana, the Adi-kavya, entitled “Tara’s Words of Pacification.”
