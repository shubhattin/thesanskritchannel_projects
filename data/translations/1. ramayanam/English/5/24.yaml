  Then, in the holy and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Sundara-kāṇḍa,
  begins the twenty-fourth sarga, called “The Rakṣasīs’ Rebuke (of Sītā).”
'1': >-
  Thereupon all those Rakṣasīs, of misshapen and dreadful countenances, spoke to
  Sītā—she who deserved no harshness—those harsh and offensive words.
'2': >-
  “Why, O Sītā, do you not consent to dwell within this inner palace—delightful
  to the hearts of all beings—furnished with couches and beds of the highest
  value?”
'3': >-
  “Because you are a human woman, you deem it greatly fitting to be the wife of
  a mere human. Turn back your mind from Rāma; it shall never be so (as you
  wish), not at any time.”
'4': >-
  “Approach Rāvaṇa, lord of the Rakṣasas, enjoyer of the treasures of the three
  worlds, and taking him as your husband, sport at ease according to your
  pleasure.”
'5': >-
  “O blameless and lovely one, do you desire that human—Rāma—who has fallen from
  his kingdom, whose aims are unfulfilled, and who is timid and powerless?”
'6': >-
  Hearing the words of the Rakṣasīs, Sītā, lotus-eyed, with both eyes filled
  with tears, spoke these words:
'7': >-
  “The speech you have uttered together—hated by the world—does not take its
  stand within my mind; that sinful utterance finds no place in me.”
'8': >-
  “A human woman is not fit to become the wife of a Rakṣasa. Eat me if you
  will—all of you as you please; I shall not do as you command.”
'9': >-
  “Whether wretched or deprived of his kingdom, he who is my husband is my
  venerable lord and teacher. To him I am ever devoted, as Suvarcalā is devoted
  to the Sun.”
'10': >-
  “As the noble Śacī attends upon Śakra; as Arundhatī attends upon Vasiṣṭha; as
  Rohiṇī attends upon the Moon—so (am I devoted to my lord).”
'11': >-
  “As Lopāmudrā to Agastya; as Sukanyā to Cyavana; as Sāvitrī to Satyavān; as
  the illustrious Kapilā (is devoted to her lord)—so (am I).”
'12': >-
  “As Keśinī to Sagara; as Madayantī to Saudāsa; as Bhīmī, faithful to her
  husband, to Nala, lord of Niṣadha—so (am I).”
'13': >-
  “Even so am I, devoted in vow to Rāma, the best of the Ikṣvāku line, as to my
  husband.” Hearing Sītā’s words, the Rakṣasīs, faint with rage, rebuked her
  with harsh speeches, urged on by Rāvaṇa.
'14': >-
  Hanumān, silent and motionless, perched in the śiṃśapā tree, heard those
  Rakṣasīs terrifying Sītā.
'15': >-
  Rushing up to her in fury, surrounding her on every side as she trembled, they
  repeatedly licked their blazing, long fangs and lips.
'16': >-
  And, exceedingly enraged, quickly seizing axes, they said: “This woman does
  not deserve the lord Rāvaṇa, sovereign of the Rakṣasas!”
'17': >-
  Thus being reviled by the dreadful Rakṣasīs, that noble lady, herself
  overwhelmed with fear, wiped away her tears and went up to that śiṃśapā tree.
'18': >-
  Then Sītā, large-eyed, surrounded by the Rakṣasīs, approached that śiṃśapā and
  stood there, flooded with sorrow.
'19': >-
  Those terrible Rakṣasīs all around assailed her with abuse—her who was thin,
  downcast of face, and clad in soiled garments.
'20': >-
  Then a Rakṣasī named Vinatā, terrible to behold, spoke—her form enraged, her
  visage hideous, her belly sunken and dreadful:
'21': >-
  “Enough of this, Sītā—this much affection toward your husband has been
  displayed. Excess, in every matter, O auspicious lady, becomes the cause of
  calamity.”
'22': >-
  “I am satisfied—good be to you—for destiny has made you a human. But, O
  Maithilī, do what is wholesome, as I speak words beneficial to you.”
'23': >-
  “Seek Rāvaṇa as your husband—the husband of all Rakṣasīs—valiant, rushing upon
  foes, like Vāsava, the lord of the gods.”
'24': >-
  “Forsaking that miserable human Rāma, take refuge in Rāvaṇa—who is gracious,
  ready to renounce and bestow, and speaks pleasantly to all.”
'25': >-
  “O Vaidehī, anoint yourself with divine unguents and be adorned with celestial
  ornaments; from this day onward, become the sovereign lady of all the worlds.”
'26': >-
  “As the goddess Svāhā belongs to Agni, and fair Śacī to Indra, O Vaidehī—what
  have you to do with Rāma, that pitiable man whose life is spent and whose end
  is near?”
'27': >-
  “And if you will not do this word of mine, then this very moment we shall all
  devour you.”
'28': >-
  But another, named Vikaṭā, with pendulous breasts, angrily spoke to Sītā,
  raising her fist and threatening her:
'29': >-
  “Many words, unseemly and harsh, O foolish-minded one, have been borne by us
  out of compassion and gentleness toward you, O Maithilī.”
'30': >-
  “Yet you do not do our word, beneficial and prompted by the urgency of time.
  You have been brought to the farther shore of the ocean, a place hard for
  others to reach.”
'31': >-
  “You have entered the dreadful inner palace of Rāvaṇa, O Maithilī; you are
  confined within Rāvaṇa’s house, and guarded by us.”
'32': >-
  “Not even Purandara (Indra) himself is able to rescue you. Therefore, O
  Maithilī, follow the counsel of me who speaks for your good.”
'33': >-
  “Enough of the falling of tears; abandon this purposeless grief. Take to love
  and gladness, casting off your constant wretchedness.”
'34': >-
  “O Sītā, sport with the king of the Rakṣasas as you please. We know, O timid
  one, that the youth of women is not lasting.”
'35': >-
  “Before it passes away for you, obtain happiness. (Enjoy) delightful gardens
  and mountain-groves as well.”
'36': >-
  “Move about with the king of the Rakṣasas, O doe-eyed one. Thousands of women,
  O lady, shall remain under your sway, O beautiful one.”
'37': >-
  “Seek Rāvaṇa as your husband—the husband of all Rakṣasas; otherwise, tearing
  out your heart, I shall devour it, O Maithilī!”
'38': >-
  “If you do not carry out my spoken word as it ought to be…” Then a Rakṣasī
  named Caṇḍodarī, cruel to behold,
'39': >-
  whirling a huge spear, spoke these words: “This doe-fawn-eyed woman, with
  bosom trembling in terror—”
'40': >-
  “—seeing her carried off by Rāvaṇa, my resentment is great. My resolve is to
  eat her liver, spleen, great intestines, and heart together with its
  attachments.”
'41': >-
  “And likewise my thought is to eat her limbs and even her head.” Then a
  Rakṣasī named Praghasā spoke:
'42': >-
  “Why do we not strangle the throat of this wicked woman? Then let it be
  reported to the king that this human female is dead.”
'43': >-
  “There is no doubt here—he will say, ‘Eat her!’” Then a Rakṣasī named Ajāmukhī
  spoke:
'44': >-
  “Having slaughtered her, then make equal portions for all. Then let us divide
  them; I do not like quarrelling.”
'45': >-
  “Let drink be brought quickly, and many kinds of garlands.” Then a Rakṣasī
  named Śūrpaṇakhā spoke:
'46': >-
  “What Ajāmukhī has said indeed—that alone pleases me. Let liquor too be
  brought quickly, the destroyer of all grief.”
'47': >-
  “Having tasted human flesh, then shall we dance at Nikumbhilā.” Thus rebuked,
  Sītā—like the daughter of the gods—assailed by those deformed Rakṣasīs,
  letting go her fortitude, wept.
'48': >-
  Thus ends the twenty-fourth sarga of the Sundara-kāṇḍa in the holy,
  illustrious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the first poem, entitled “The Rakṣasīs’
  Rebuke.”
