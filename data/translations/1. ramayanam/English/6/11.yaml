  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the eleventh
  sarga, named “The Second Council of Ministers,” begins.
'1': >-
  That king (Rāvaṇa) became emaciated, deluded by longing for the Maithilī
  (Sītā); and through the sinful act of a sinner, he had fallen into dishonour
  in the eyes of his friends as well.
'2': >-
  Abounding exceedingly in desire, continually brooding upon Vaidehī, at that
  time—though the proper time had already passed in the course of the
  war—Rāvaṇa, together with his ministers and friends, deemed it to be the
  fitting moment (to act).
'3': >-
  Approaching a great chariot whose network-like workmanship shone like gold and
  which was adorned with gems and coral, and whose horses were well-trained, he
  mounted it.
'4': >-
  Having taken his stand upon that excellent chariot, whose sound was like that
  of a great cloud, Daśagrīva (Rāvaṇa), the foremost of the rākṣasas, set out
  toward the assembly hall.
'5': >-
  Then the rākṣasa warriors—bearing swords and shields and carrying every kind
  of weapon—set out in front of the lord of rākṣasas.
'6': >-
  Wearing diverse and grotesque disguises, and adorned with various ornaments,
  they surrounded him on the flanks and from behind, and went along then.
'7': >-
  And swift atirathas in their chariots, and intoxicated, excellent elephants,
  and horses sporting about, followed after Daśagrīva.
'8': >-
  Some had maces and iron clubs in their hands; some held spears and javelins;
  others bore axes; and still others carried tridents. Then there arose a mighty
  roar of thousands of musical instruments.
'9': >-
  When Rāvaṇa was going to the assembly hall, there was a tumultuous blast of
  conches; and with the loud clamour of wheels he resounded mightily all at
  once.
'10': >-
  That great chariot-warrior entered upon the royal road, graced with splendour;
  and a spotless white royal parasol held aloft shone over him.
'11': >-
  Pale-white like the full moon, the lord of rākṣasas appeared—set amid a golden
  staff and canopy, with a form like pure crystal.
'12': >-
  On his left and right, the yak-tail fans waved and shone. And all those
  attendants—some standing on the chariot, some upon the ground—stood with hands
  joined in reverence.
'13': >-
  The rākṣasas bowed to that foremost of rākṣasas with their heads; and while
  he, the subduer of foes, was being praised by the rākṣasas with blessings of
  victory, he proceeded on.
'14': >-
  Of great radiance, he reached then that assembly hall, fashioned (with art),
  strewn with gold and silver, with an interior of pure crystal.
'15': >-
  Shining in his bodily splendour, clad in a garment with a golden border, he
  approached that ever-luminous hall, guarded by six hundred piśācas.
'16': >-
  The great and radiant one entered that well-wrought hall made by Viśvakarmā.
  There, covered with a tiger-skin dear to him and made of vaidūrya (cat’s-eye
  gem),
'17': >-
  Rāvaṇa took his seat upon a vast, supreme throne with a support behind; then,
  like a sovereign, he commanded the swift-moving messengers.
'18': >-
  “Bring for me quickly, here, those rākṣasas. I know a great matter is at hand,
  something that must be done in regard to the enemies.”
'19': >-
  Hearing those words, the rākṣasas moved about in Laṅkā, going house by house,
  also to places of recreation and resting-quarters, and to the gardens—urging
  the rākṣasas forth fearlessly.
'20': >-
  Some went mounted within chariots; some, in pride, mounted strong horses; some
  climbed upon elephants; and some went on foot.
'21': >-
  That city became exceedingly crowded with chariots, elephants, and horses; and
  with them rushing and soaring it shone—like the sky filled with Garuḍas.
'22': >-
  After setting their mounts and various vehicles in place, they entered the
  assembly hall on foot, like lions entering a mountain cave.
'23': >-
  Taking hold of the king’s feet, and being duly honoured by the king, some sat
  upon seats, some upon couches, and some sat down on the ground.
'24': >-
  Thus gathered in the assembly hall by the king’s command, the rākṣasas
  attended upon Rāvaṇa, the lord of rākṣasas, each according to his rank.
'25': >-
  And the counsellors—foremost in their order—learned men of settled judgment in
  matters to be determined; and the ministers endowed with virtues, all-knowing,
  discerning in understanding—
'26': >-
  All came there in hundreds, and many heroes as well, into that golden-hued
  assembly hall, for the successful accomplishment of every purpose.
'27': >-
  Then the illustrious Vibhīṣaṇa, a great-souled one, mounting a spacious,
  well-yoked, excellent chariot with limbs ornamented in gold, set out to the
  council-hall of his elder brother.
'28': >-
  He, the younger brother, first announced himself to his elder brother by name,
  and then bowed at his feet. Śuka and Prahasta likewise assigned to him and the
  others separate seats, each as was fitting.
'29': >-
  In that assembly of rākṣasas—wearing fine garments and adorned with various
  golden and jeweled ornaments—the fragrances of their priceless aloe-wood and
  sandal, and of their garlands, blew all around.
'30': >-
  No one cried out, and no one spoke falsehood; the members of the assembly did
  not even chatter loudly. All were accomplished in their aims, all of dreadful
  valour; and all of them kept their gaze upon their lord’s face.
'31': >-
  That Rāvaṇa—high-spirited among weapon-bearers, and among the mighty in battle
  himself high-spirited—shone in that assembly with his radiance, like the
  thunderbolt-handed Indra amid the Vasus.
'32': >-
  Thus ends the eleventh sarga, named “The Second Council of Ministers,” in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the revered Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
