  Now, in the auspicious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, in the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, begins the
  seventy-eighth chapter, called “The Casting Away of the Hunchback (Mantharā).”
'1': >-
  Here, as Bharata—consumed by grief—was preparing to depart on the journey,
  Śatrughna, the younger brother of Lakṣmaṇa, spoke to him these words:
'2': >-
  “He who is the refuge and course of all beings in their distress—how much more
  is He so for His own! That Rāma, endowed with steadfast virtue and excellence
  of character, has been banished to the forest by a woman.”
'3': >-
  “And that Lakṣmaṇa too—mighty, and possessed of valor—why does he not set Rāma
  free, even if it means restraining or overpowering his own father?”
'4': >-
  “Indeed, that king should have been checked at the very outset, after
  discerning what is right and what is wrong—he who has taken to a wrongful path
  and has come under the sway of a woman.”
'5': >-
  While Śatrughna, Lakṣmaṇa’s younger brother, was speaking thus, there appeared
  at the eastern gate the hunchback woman, adorned with all ornaments.
'6': >-
  Smeared with the essence of sandalwood paste, wearing royal garments, and
  decked with manifold ornaments of various kinds, she shone forth.
'7': >-
  With her many-hued girdles and strings fastened about her waist, she appeared
  like a she-monkey bound about with cords—tied in many places, as it were, with
  ropes.
'8': >-
  Seeing her then, Dvāsthā—deeply regarding her as one who wrought great
  sin—seized the hunchback Mantharā without compassion and presented her to
  Śatrughna.
'9': >-
  “It is because of her that Rāma lies in the forest, and because of her your
  father has laid down his body (has died). This is that sinful and cruel
  woman—deal with her as you deem fit.”
'10': >-
  Śatrughna, understanding that statement, deeply afflicted, spoke to all the
  attendants of the inner palace, being steadfast in his resolve:
'11': >-
  “A fierce sorrow has been brought upon me—both for my brothers and for my
  father. Let this woman reap the fruit of that cruel deed.”
'12': >-
  Thus addressed by him, the hunchback—surrounded by her circle of
  companions—was quickly seized by force; yet she did not heed it, but clung to
  her own house and security.
'13': >-
  Then all her friends, exceedingly distressed, perceiving Śatrughna’s anger,
  fled away in all directions.
'14': >-
  And her entire company of companions consulted together: “Since he has thus
  advanced in fury, he will surely do away with us completely.”
'15': >-
  “Let us go for refuge to Kauśalyā—compassionate, generous, knower of dharma,
  and renowned. Let her indeed be our certain and abiding refuge.”
'16': >-
  But Śatrughna, the scorcher of foes, his eyes reddened with rage, dragged the
  hunchback along then, as she cried out upon the ground.
'17': >-
  As Mantharā was being dragged this way and that, many kinds of curious vessels
  and articles fell and were shattered upon the earth.
'18': >-
  The splendid royal residence, strewn everywhere with those broken articles,
  looked unsightly then—like the autumn sky when it is filled with scattered
  masses (of cloud).
'19': >-
  Then that powerful Śatrughna, best of men, seizing her in the strength of his
  wrath, intended to rebuke Kaikeyī and spoke harsh words.
'20': >-
  Tormented by those harsh and grievous words, Kaikeyī was deeply distressed;
  and, terrified of Śatrughna, she went to her son for refuge.
'21': >-
  Seeing Śatrughna enraged, Bharata said to him: “Women are not to be slain by
  any being; let her be forgiven.”
'22': >-
  Śatrughna replied: “I would slay this sinful Kaikeyī, wicked in conduct, if
  only righteous Rāma would not condemn me as a slayer of my mother.”
'23': >-
  “If Rāghava were to learn that this hunchback too has been slain, that
  righteous-souled one would surely not speak to you and to me.”
'24': >-
  Hearing Bharata’s words, Śatrughna—the younger brother of Lakṣmaṇa—then turned
  back from his wrath and released Mantharā.
'25': >-
  Mantharā fell at Kaikeyī’s feet, breathing heavily, overcome with intense
  sorrow and anguish, and lamented piteously.
'26': >-
  Seeing the hunchback—her senses confounded from being hurled about by
  Śatrughna—Bharata’s mother (Kaikeyī) slowly comforted her, as she lay in
  distress, gazing like a krauñchī-bird caught fast (in a snare).
'27': >-
  Thus ends, in the venerable and illustrious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya,
  within the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa, the seventy-eighth chapter, called “The Casting Away
  of the Hunchback (Mantharā).”
