  Now begins the one-hundred-and-twenty-ninth canto (sarga) of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa
  of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Conversation between Hanumān and
  Bharata.”
'1': >-
  “Many indeed are the years since my lord went forth to the great forest. Now I
  hear tidings that gladden my heart—the narration of my master’s deeds.”
'2': >-
  “Auspicious indeed is this tale; it seems to me like a common story of the
  world, yet—marvelous as it is—it brings joy to a man even though he were to
  live a hundred years.”
'3': >-
  “How did the meeting of Rāghava and the monkeys come about? In what region did
  it take place, and depending on what circumstances? Tell me the truth in full,
  for I ask.”
'4': >-
  Thus questioned by the prince, Hanumān, seated upon a seat, then related
  everything—the whole course of Rāma’s life in the forest.
'5': >-
  How Rāma was banished because of the two boons granted by your mother; and how
  King Daśaratha, consumed by grief for his son, met his death.
'6': >-
  How you, O lord, were swiftly brought back from the royal household by
  messengers; and how, when you entered Ayodhyā, you did not desire the
  sovereignty.
'7': >-
  How, having gone to Mount Citrakūṭa, you—crusher of foes—invited your brother,
  who was practising the dharma of the righteous, to accept the kingdom.
'8': >-
  How, abiding by the word of the king, he renounced the kingdom; and how you
  took the noble one’s sandals and returned again.
'9': >-
  “All this, O mighty-armed one, is known to you exactly as it happened. But
  after you had departed again—what then occurred? Hear it from me.”
'10': >-
  When you had gone, that forest became as it were utterly desolate—its deer and
  birds thrown into confusion, and it seeming plunged into deep sorrow.
'11': >-
  Then he entered that vast and lonely Daṇḍaka forest—terrible, trampled by
  elephants, and filled with lions, tigers, and deer.
'12': >-
  As they proceeded—strong and valiant—through that dense woodland, Vīrādha
  appeared before them, roaring forth a mighty sound.
'13': >-
  Lifting him up—shouting, with arms raised aloft and face turned downward—they
  hurled him into a pit, like a bellowing elephant cast down.
'14': >-
  Having accomplished that difficult deed, the two brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa,
  at evening reached the lovely hermitage of Śarabhanga.
'15': >-
  When Śarabhanga had attained heaven, Rāma—whose prowess is ever true—having
  paid homage to all the sages, went onward to Janasthāna.
'16': >-
  After that, a woman named Śūrpaṇakhā approached Rāma’s side. Then, at Rāma’s
  direction, Lakṣmaṇa rose up at once.
'17': >-
  Taking up his sword, the mighty one cut off her ears and nose; and thereafter
  fourteen thousand rākṣasas of dreadful deeds—
'18': >-
  —were slain there by the great-souled Rāghava dwelling in that place, when
  they met with Rāma on the foremost field of battle.
'19': >-
  Within a quarter of a day, those rākṣasas were made utterly bereft—great in
  strength and great in valor, and obstructers of austerities.
'20': >-
  Those rākṣasas dwelling in the Daṇḍaka forest were slain by Rāghava in battle;
  they were crushed, and Khara too was killed in the fight.
'21': >-
  Having first slain Dūṣaṇa, and then Trīśiras thereafter, the young woman,
  tormented by him, went to Rāvaṇa.
'22': >-
  A dreadful rākṣasa named Mārīca, an attendant of Rāvaṇa, enticed Vaidehī by
  becoming a deer made as though of jewels.
'23': >-
  Seeing it, Vaidehī said to Rāma, “Let it be caught. This charming and lovely
  one shall grace our hermitage.”
'24': >-
  Then Rāma, bow in hand, pursued that deer; and as it ran, he struck it down
  with an arrow whose joints were not curved.
'25': >-
  Then that ten-necked one—O gentle sir—came there when Rāghava had gone after
  the deer and Lakṣmaṇa too had stepped out; and he entered the hermitage then.
'26': >-
  With violence he seized Sītā, like the planet Rāhu seizing Rohiṇī in the sky;
  and then, desiring to rescue her, the vulture Jaṭāyuṣ was slain by him in
  battle.
'27': >-
  Seizing Sītā suddenly, that rākṣasa swiftly departed. Then certain beings of
  wondrous appearance stood upon a mountain summit.
'28': >-
  The monkey-warriors, like mountains in stature, saw Rāvaṇa, lord of the
  rākṣasas, going away bearing Sītā; and their faces were filled with
  astonishment.
'29': >-
  Then, going even more swiftly to that aerial car of mind-swift speed, that
  mighty one mounted the Puṣpaka with Vaidehī.
'30': >-
  Then Rāvaṇa, ruler of rākṣasas, entered Laṅkā and brought her to a great and
  auspicious mansion adorned with gold.
'31': >-
  Having brought Maithilī in, Rāvaṇa sought to soothe her with words; but she
  treated his speech like a straw, and him—the foremost of the
  night-rangers—with contempt.
'32': >-
  Vaidehī, not giving way to thought of him, went into the Aśoka grove; and at
  that time Rāma, having killed the deer in the forest, turned back.
'33': >-
  As the descendant of Kakutstha returned, seeing the vulture he was pained; and
  seeing the vulture slain, Rāma—who loved it as his own father—was stricken.
'34': >-
  Searching for Vaidehī, Rāghava together with Lakṣmaṇa wandered along the
  Godāvarī and through forest tracts in bloom.
'35': >-
  In that great wilderness they encountered a rākṣasa named Kabandha. Then, by
  the counsel of Kabandha, Rāma—whose valor is ever true—
'36': >-
  —went to Mount Ṛṣyamūka and met Sugrīva. First, through joy, there arose a
  heartfelt friendship between the two.
'37': >-
  Sugrīva had formerly been cast out by his enraged brother Vāli; and from their
  mutual converse, deep affection grew between them.
'38': >-
  Rāma, by the strength of his own arms, restored Sugrīva to his kingdom,
  slaying Vāli in battle—huge of body and mighty of strength.
'39': >-
  Sugrīva was स्थापित (installed) in the sovereignty, attended by all the
  monkeys; and he pledged to Rāma the search for the king’s daughter.
'40': >-
  Commanded by Sugrīva, the great-souled lord of monkeys, ten crores of
  monkey-warriors in all were dispatched to every direction.
'41': >-
  For us who had gone far away—on the excellent Vindhya mountain—tormented
  greatly by grief, much time passed.
'42': >-
  Then Sampāti, the valorous brother of the king of vultures, told us of Sītā’s
  abode—in Rāvaṇa’s palace.
'43': >-
  “Then I, driving away the sorrow of my kinsmen who were overwhelmed with
  grief, relying upon my own valor, leapt a hundred yojanas; and there I saw
  her, gone into the Aśoka grove, alone.”
'44': >-
  Clad in soiled silk garments, joyless, steadfast in her vow—having approached
  that blameless lady and questioned her properly about everything—
'45': >-
  —I gave her a token of recognition: Rāma’s signet-ring bearing his name. And
  receiving in return the token—a jewel—I came back having fulfilled my purpose.
'46': >-
  And again, having returned, I delivered to Rāma of unwearied deeds that token
  of recognition—the radiant great jewel.
'47': >-
  Hearing of that Maithilī, Rāma praised your continued life; having reached the
  very end of his endurance, he was like a sick man who has drunk nectar.
'48': >-
  Resolving upon the undertaking, he fixed his mind on the slaying of Laṅkā,
  like Fire (Vibhāvasu) at the end of the world intent on consuming all beings.
'49': >-
  Then, reaching the ocean, he had Nala build a bridge; and by that bridge the
  army of heroic monkeys crossed over.
'50': >-
  Nīla slew Prahasta; Rāghava slew Kumbhakarṇa; Lakṣmaṇa slew the son of Rāvaṇa;
  and Rāma himself slew Rāvaṇa.
'51': >-
  Then he met with Śakra (Indra), with Yama and Varuṇa, and also with Maheśvara
  and Svayambhū (Brahmā), and with Daśaratha as well.
'52': >-
  And by those sages who had assembled, and by the divine sages too, the
  illustrious scion of Kakutstha, scorcher of foes, received boons granted by
  them.
'53': >-
  Then, endowed with those boons, and joyfully joined by the monkeys, he
  approached Kiṣkindhā in the Puṣpaka aerial car.
'54': >-
  “Reaching the Gaṅgā again, and spending the springtime near the sages, you
  shall, without obstacle, on the morrow—under the auspicious conjunction of
  Puṣya—behold Rāma.”
'55': >-
  Hearing these sweet words of Hanumān, Bharata—delighted and with palms
  joined—spoke words filled with the exultation of his heart: “After a long
  time, indeed, my desire is fulfilled.”
'56': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-twenty-ninth canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the
  venerable, holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Conversation
  between Hanumān and Bharata.”
