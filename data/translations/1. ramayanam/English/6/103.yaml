  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the
  one-hundred-and-third sarga, named “The Felling of Indra’s Chariot-banner.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words spoken by Lakṣmaṇa, that Rāghava—mighty, and a slayer of
  hostile heroes—took up his bow and set it upon the string.
'2': >-
  At the forefront of the host he hurled forth dreadful arrows at Rāvaṇa. Then
  the lord of rākṣasas, mounting another chariot, advanced.
'3': >-
  Daśagrīva rushed upon the son of Kakutstha like Svarbhānu upon the Sun.
  Standing in his chariot, he struck Rāma with arrows like thunderbolts, as a
  rain-cloud smites a great mountain with torrents of water.
'4': >-
  Then Rāma, collected in battle, showered Daśagrīva with arrows that were like
  blazing fire and adorned with ornaments of gold.
'5': >-
  The devas, gandharvas, and kinnaras declared: “This battle is not equal—Rāma
  stands upon the ground, while that rākṣasa fights from a chariot.”
'6': >-
  Then Śakra, the illustrious lord of the devas, hearing their nectar-like
  speech, summoned Mātali and spoke these words:
'7': >-
  “Go swiftly with my chariot to Raghu’s foremost, who stands on the ground.
  Bring him up from the earth and accomplish this great good for the devas.”
'8': >-
  Thus addressed by the king of the gods, Mātali, the divine charioteer, bowed
  his head to the deity and then replied:
'9': >-
  “I shall go at once, O Indra, and I shall perform the office of charioteer.”
  Then, yoking the excellent chariot with green (hari) steeds,
'10': >-
  —a chariot with limbs wondrously fashioned in gold, adorned with hundreds of
  tinkling bells, radiant like the young sun, with a yoke made of vaidūrya-gem,
  and drawn by noble horses bearing golden head-plates, sprinkled with white—
'11': >-
  and with green steeds sun-bright, embellished with networks of gold, and
  bearing a splendid banner of golden bamboo—Indra’s supreme chariot—
'12': >-
  Mātali, commanded by the lord of the devas, mounted that chariot and,
  descending from Triviṣṭapa (heaven), came swiftly to the son of Kakutstha.
'13': >-
  Then, standing upon the chariot with goad in hand, Mātali—charioteer of the
  Thousand-eyed—addressed Rāma with joined palms:
'14': >-
  “O Kakutstha, this chariot has been given to you by the Thousand-eyed for your
  victory, O great-souled one, illustrious crusher of foes.
'15': >-
  Here is this mighty, celestial bow of Indra, and this cuirass that is like
  blazing fire; and these arrows radiant as the sun; and this spear—spotless and
  auspicious.
'16': >-
  Mount this chariot, O hero, and slay the rākṣasa Rāvaṇa—just as the god
  Mahendra slew the dānavas—with me as your charioteer.”
'17': >-
  Thus spoken to, Rāma circumambulated that chariot, saluted it, and then
  mounted it, making the worlds shine with his splendor.
'18': >-
  Then that chariot-to-chariot combat became wondrous and hair-raising—between
  Rāma of mighty arms and Rāvaṇa the rākṣasa.
'19': >-
  Rāghava, supreme knower of missiles, with a gandharva-weapon struck down the
  gandharva-weapon, and with a divine weapon struck down the divine weapon of
  the rākṣasa-king.
'20': >-
  But the Night-ranger, the lord of rākṣasas, exceedingly enraged, once again
  unleashed a most dreadful, supreme rākṣasa-weapon.
'21': >-
  Those arrows, released from Rāvaṇa’s bow and adorned with gold, came rushing
  at the son of Kakutstha, becoming great venomous serpents.
'22': >-
  With flaming faces, vomiting fire from their mouths, those terrible ones—jaws
  agape—rushed straight at Rāma.
'23': >-
  With their touch like Vāsuki’s, with blazing hoods, and with mighty poison,
  all the quarters and the intermediate directions were filled and covered.
'24': >-
  Seeing those serpent-arrows falling upon him in battle, Rāma brought forth the
  terrible, fearsome Gāruḍa weapon.
'25': >-
  Those arrows released from Rāghava’s bow—golden-feathered and shining like
  fire—became golden suparṇas (Garuḍa-birds), foes of serpents, and ranged
  about.
'26': >-
  In the form of suparṇas, Rāma’s swift, shapeshifting shafts struck down all
  those serpent-formed, exceedingly rapid arrows.
'27': >-
  When his weapon was countered, Rāvaṇa, lord of rākṣasas, wrathful, then rained
  upon Rāma dreadful showers of arrows.
'28': >-
  Then, with a thousand arrows, he afflicted Rāma, whose efforts do not fail;
  and with a torrent of shafts he struck Mātali in return.
'29': >-
  Aiming at the banner, Rāvaṇa severed it with a single arrow, and, felling the
  golden standard, cast it down upon the chariot-platform.
'30': >-
  With a net of arrows Rāvaṇa even struck down Indra’s horses. The devas,
  gandharvas, and cāraṇas, together with the dānavas, were plunged into sorrow.
'31': >-
  Seeing Rāma then afflicted, the Siddhas and the great seers were distressed;
  and the monkey-lords too, together with Vibhīṣaṇa, became anguished.
'32': >-
  Seeing Rāmacandra—the Moon—seized by Rāvaṇa the Rāhu, and seeing also Rohiṇī,
  the Prajāpati-star, dear to the Moon,
'33': >-
  Mercury (Budha) approached and stood there, bringing calamity to creatures,
  while the ocean, as it were, blazed with smoke-wreathed waves.
'34': >-
  Then the Sun, cruel and copper-hued, with pale rays, sprang up in wrath, as
  though touching the orb of the sun itself.
'35': >-
  There appeared the star marked with a headless trunk (kabandhāṅka), conjoined
  with the comet. And the star of the Kośalas, clearly presided over by Indra
  and Agni, was seen.
'36': >-
  Having struck, Mars stood in the sky upon Viśākhā as well—while the
  ten-headed, twenty-armed one stood with bow in hand.
'37': >-
  Daśagrīva was seen like Mount Maināka. But Rāma, being driven back by that
  rākṣasa Daśagrīva,
'38': >-
  could not fix his arrows upon the foremost of the battlefield. Frowning in
  anger, his eyes slightly reddened,
'39': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-third sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the
  venerable, illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, named “The Felling
  of Indra’s Chariot-banner.”
