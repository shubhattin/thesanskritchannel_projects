  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins the
  seventy-seventh sarga, called “The Inquiry concerning the Denizen of Heaven
  (Svargīpraśna).”
'1': >-
  Formerly, in the Tretā-yuga, O Rāma, there existed a vast tract of wilderness,
  extending on every side for a hundred yojanas—devoid of wild beasts and bereft
  of birds.
'2': >-
  In that unpeopled forest, while I was practising excellent austerities, O
  gentle one, I came to that woodland, O blameless prince.
'3': >-
  The nature of that forest I am not able to describe fully—abounding in trees
  of many forms, and rich in fruits and roots of delightful taste.
'4': >-
  And in the very midst of that forest there was a lake, a yojana in length,
  thronged with swans and kāraṇḍava-ducks, and made beautiful by pairs of
  cakravāka-birds.
'5': >-
  It was filled with lotuses and water-lilies, and had overpassed its mass of
  algae; it appeared exceedingly wondrous, and its water was of unsurpassed
  sweetness to the taste.
'6': >-
  Dustless it was and untroubled, and splendid, crowded with flocks of birds.
  Near that lake stood a great and marvellous hermitage.
'7': >-
  It was ancient, supremely holy, and—though it was a hermitage—devoid of
  ascetics. There I spent the night in the heat-season, O bull among men.
'8': >-
  At dawn, rising early, I approached that lake; then I beheld there, in some
  place, a corpse—well-nourished and not wasted.
'9': >-
  Its limbs were made plump by the splitting and coating of mire, and it had
  taken refuge in that pool; and there it stood, O king, in that expanse of
  water, endowed with great comeliness.
'10': >-
  Pondering over its meaning, O Rāghava, I remained there for a moment on the
  lake’s bank, thinking, “Lord, what indeed can this be?”
'11': >-
  Then, within a short while, I saw a wondrous sight of divine splendour—a most
  excellent aerial car (vimāna), supremely magnificent, yoked with swans and
  swift as the mind.
'12': >-
  In that vimāna, O delight of the Raghu line, there sat a veritable denizen of
  heaven; and a thousand apsarases, adorned with divine ornaments, attended upon
  him, O hero.
'13': >-
  Some sang celestial songs; others played instruments; others sported; and
  still others danced.
'14': >-
  And other apsarases, holding golden-handled fly-whisks bright as moonbeams,
  fanned his face—his eyes resembling the petals of a white lotus.
'15': >-
  Then, leaving his seat, radiant like a peak of Meru, he descended from that
  vimāna before my very eyes, O Rāma; and that heaven-dweller, O delight of the
  Raghu line, ate that corpse.
'16': >-
  Having thus eaten at his pleasure much flesh, exceedingly fat, the
  heaven-dweller descended into the lake and began to bathe.
'17': >-
  Having performed the ablution according to rule, that heaven-dweller, O
  foremost of the Raghus, set about mounting again that best and excellent
  vimāna.
'18': >-
  Seeing him, godlike in appearance, as he was mounting it, I then spoke these
  words to that denizen of heaven, O best of men.
'19': >-
  “Who are you, who look like a god? And this food is censurable. Gentle sir,
  you eat this—tell me, for what reason?”
'20': >-
  “How can such a condition be—such food approved for one who is like a god?
  This is a marvel, gentle sir; I wish to hear the truth in full.”
'21': “I do not deem this corpse to be a fitting thing for you to eat.”
'22': >-
  Thus addressed, O lord of men, that denizen of heaven, moved by curiosity and
  with truthful, gentle speech, having heard all these words of mine, then
  related everything to me exactly as it was.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-seventh sarga, called “The Inquiry concerning the
  Denizen of Heaven (Svargīpraśna),” in the Uttarakāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic.
