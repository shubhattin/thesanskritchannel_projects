  Now begins the eighty-seventh canto of the Uttara-Kāṇḍa of the illustrious
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Attainment of Womanhood by Ila.”
'1': >-
  Hearing those words spoken by Lakṣmaṇa, Rāghava—of great splendour, and
  skilled in discourse—answered him in a smiling tone.
'2': >-
  “Even so, O best of men, just as you say, Lakṣmaṇa: (I shall tell you) fully
  and without remainder about the slaying of Vṛtra, and also about whatever
  fruit accrues from the Aśvamedha sacrifice.
'3': >-
  “For it is heard, O gentle one, that in ancient times there was a splendid and
  high-minded son of Prajāpati Kardama, named Ila, lord of Bāhlī.
'4': >-
  “That king, having brought the whole earth under his sway, being truly
  righteous, protected his kingdom as though it were his own son, O tiger among
  men.
'5': >-
  “He was ever worshipped by the most generous Devas, by the very wealthy
  Daityas, and by the Nāgas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas, and the great-souled Yakṣas
  as well,
'6': >-
  “—worshipped constantly, O gentle one, O delight of the Raghu line—by those
  tormented with fear; and the three worlds were afraid of that great-souled one
  when he was wrathful.
'7': >-
  “Such indeed was that king: steadfast in dharma and in valour, and supremely
  noble in understanding—Bāhlīkeśa of great renown.
'8': >-
  “That mighty-armed one undertook a hunt in a beautiful forest, in the
  delightful month of Caitra, accompanied by his servants, forces, and mounts.
'9': >-
  “And in the wilderness the king slew deer by hundreds and by thousands; yet
  even after killing them, no satisfaction arose in that great-souled king.
'10': >-
  “Slaying ten thousand various kinds of beasts, that great-souled king came to
  the region where Mahāsena (Kārttikeya) had been born.
'11': >-
  “In that very tract, O lord of gods, Hara—the irresistible one—together with
  all his attendants, sported with the daughter of the lord of mountains.
'12': >-
  “Umāpati, he whose banner bears the emblem of the bull, assuming the form of a
  woman for himself—wishing to do what was pleasing to the Goddess—remained
  there at that mountain-stream.
'13': >-
  “And whatever beings were in that forest-region who were spoken of as males,
  and even the trees that bore male names—at that time they became women.
'14': >-
  “Indeed, whatsoever was there, all of it became designated as female. In the
  meantime, that king Ila, son of Kardama, while slaying thousands of beasts,
  came to that region.
'15': >-
  “He saw that everything had been transformed into womanhood—together with its
  serpents, beasts, and birds; and he saw himself too transformed into a woman,
  along with his followers, O delight of the Raghus.
'16': >-
  “Great was his sorrow on seeing himself thus altered; and, understanding that
  this was the deed of Umāpati, he was seized with fear.
'17': >-
  “Then the king, with his servants, forces, and vehicles, went for refuge to
  that great-souled God—blue-throated, the bearer of matted locks (Śiva).”
'18': >-
  “Thereupon the great Lord, the granter of boons, laughing, together with the
  Goddess, spoke himself to the son of Prajāpati (Ila).”
'19': >-
  “‘Rise, rise, O royal seer, O mighty Kārḍameya! Except for manhood, O gentle
  one—choose a boon, O man of good vows.’”
'20': >-
  “Then that king, afflicted with grief, being refused by the great-souled one,
  and having become a woman, did not accept any other boon from the supreme of
  the gods.
'21': >-
  “Then, overwhelmed by great sorrow, the king bowed down to Umā, the daughter
  of the lord of mountains—prostrating himself with his whole inner being.
'22': >-
  “‘O mistress of boons, O giver of boons, you are the sovereign of the worlds,
  O fair one! O Goddess of unfailing vision, look upon me with a gentle eye.’”
'23': >-
  “Knowing what lay in the heart of that royal seer in Hara’s presence, the
  Goddess—approved by Rudra—answered with auspicious words:
'24': >-
  “‘The God (Śiva) is the giver of boons for one half, and I am the giver of
  boons for the other half for you. Therefore take one half—(alternating)
  between womanhood and manhood—as long as you wish.’”
'25': >-
  “Hearing that unsurpassed boon spoken by the Goddess—more marvellous still—,
  the king, his mind filled with joy, spoke these words:
'26': >-
  “‘If, O Goddess, you are pleased with me, though my form is unmatched upon the
  earth, then let me abide as a woman for one month, and again be a man for one
  month.’”
'27': >-
  “Knowing his desired request, the Goddess of exceedingly lovely countenance
  answered him with auspicious words: ‘Even so, even so shall it be.’”
'28': >-
  “‘O king, when you are a man, you will not remember the state of womanhood;
  and when you have become a woman for the next month, you will not remember
  manhood.’”
'29': >-
  “Thus that Kārḍami king—being a man for one month—became, for one month, a
  woman, Ila, of beauty that surpassed even the beauty of the three worlds.
'30': >-
  “Thus ends the eighty-seventh canto of the Uttara-Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled ‘The Attainment of Womanhood by Ila.’
