  Now begins the sixty-second canto in Sundara-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Outcry of Dadhimukha.”
'1': >-
  Then Hanumān, the best of monkeys—the bull among vānaras—spoke to them: “Let
  your minds be untroubled; you vānaras, partake of the honey.”
'2': >-
  “I shall ward off those who would oppose you.” Having heard Hanumān’s words,
  Aṅgada—the foremost among the monkeys—(responded).
'3': >-
  With a glad heart Aṅgada replied: “Let the monkeys drink the honey. Indeed,
  the word of Hanumān—who has accomplished the task—must certainly be carried
  out by me.”
'4': >-
  “Even what ought not to be done becomes to be done—how much more so a matter
  such as this!” Hearing the words from Aṅgada’s mouth, the bull-like vānaras—
'5': >-
  —delighted, exclaimed “Well said! Well said!” and honored his reply. Having
  paid homage to Aṅgada—the bull among monkeys—all the monkeys—
'6': —went to the Madhu-grove, like a torrent of a river rushing upon trees.
'7': >-
  Those swift ones—because of the great release (of pent-up strain), and having
  seen and heard of Maithilī—then all drank the honey and took rich and juicy
  fruits.
'8': >-
  Then all of them sprang up and, encountering the assembled keepers of the
  grove, they struck them by the hundreds, being wholly engrossed in that
  honey-garden.
'9': >-
  Some monkeys, overjoyed there in groups, seized with their arms vats-measures
  of honey and drank.
'10': >-
  All together they smote (the guards), while others ate. Some—honey-golden in
  hue—after drinking, would cast away the honey (vessels) as well.
'11': >-
  Some, fierce, struck one another with what remained of the honey. Others stood
  at the roots of trees, holding branches (in their hands).
'12': >-
  And utterly worn out by intoxication, they lay down, spreading leaves as their
  beds. The monkeys, driven by frenzied impulses—drunk with honey—rejoiced
  exceedingly.
'13': >-
  Some even hurled one another about; others stumbled. Some made loud sounds;
  some chattered in glee.
'14': >-
  Some monkeys, intoxicated with honey, slept upon the ground. Some, emboldened,
  laughed; others did this and that in various ways.
'15': >-
  Some babbled after acting; others, on the contrary, came to their senses. And
  those who were the honey-guards here—servants of Dadhimukha—
'16': >-
  —were repelled by those terrible monkeys and fled in all directions; they were
  rubbed down with knees (thrust and dragged along), and the “divine path” was
  shown to them (i.e., they were beaten and roughly handled, and made to see
  stars).
'17': >-
  Then, exceedingly distressed, they went to Dadhimukha and spoke: “By force the
  Madhu-grove has been laid waste by those who have received boons from Hanumān;
  and we too have been rubbed with knees and shown the divine path.”
'18': >-
  Then Dadhimukha—the monkey who was keeper of the grove—angered on hearing that
  the Madhu-grove had been destroyed, consoled those monkeys (the guards).
'19': >-
  “Come, let us go! We shall go to those exceedingly insolent monkeys. By force
  I shall restrain them as they consume that excellent honey.”
'20': >-
  Hearing these words of Dadhimukha, the heroic bull-like monkeys went back
  again to the Madhu-grove, accompanied by him.
'21': >-
  In their midst, Dadhimukha, firmly grasping a great tree, ran forward with
  speed, and all those monkeys ran as well.
'22': >-
  Taking rocks, trees, and even boulders, those enraged monkeys advanced to
  where those elephant-like monkeys were.
'23': >-
  Seeking to restrain them by force, the monkeys confronted the monkeys—lips
  pressed tight in anger—reviling them again and again.
'24': >-
  Then, seeing Dadhimukha enraged, the foremost of monkeys—then led by
  Hanumān—rushed upon him with speed.
'25': >-
  As that mighty-armed, very powerful one came on—bearing the tree and moving
  swiftly—Aṅgada, enraged, seized him with his arms.
'26': >-
  Blinded by intoxication, he showed no compassion, thinking, “He is my elder.”
  Then he quickly crushed him to the ground with force.
'27': >-
  With arms, thighs, and face broken, shaken, drenched in blood, that great
  hero—elephant among monkeys—fainted for a moment.
'28': >-
  Somehow released by those monkeys, Dadhimukha—the bull among monkeys—went
  aside and spoke to his own attendants who had gathered around.
'29': >-
  “Come, let us go—to where our lord, the monkey Sugrīva of broad neck, stands
  together with Rāma.”
'30': >-
  “And we shall report to the king in full this offence of Aṅgada. When the
  intolerant one hears these words, he will have the monkeys slain.”
'31': >-
  “For this Madhu-grove is dear to the great-souled Sugrīva—an ancestral and
  paternal inheritance, divine, and difficult of access even to the gods.”
'32': >-
  “Sugrīva, along with his friends and kinsmen, will punish with chastisement
  all these honey-greedy monkeys whose lives are as good as ended.”
'33': >-
  “Indeed these evil-souled ones, who oppose the king’s command, deserve to be
  slain. The wrath born of my intolerance will be fulfilled.”
'34': >-
  Having spoken thus, Dadhimukha, of great strength, sprang up and departed at
  once, accompanied by the grove-guards.
'35': >-
  In no more than the space between two blinks, he reached the monkey-dwelling
  where the wise Sugrīva—son of the thousand-rayed Sun—was.
'36': >-
  Seeing Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, and Sugrīva as well, he descended from the sky and
  alighted upon the earth.
'37': >-
  That great hero, the monkey Dadhimukha—lord of the guards—fell down,
  surrounded by all those keepers of the grove.
'38': >-
  With a sorrowful face, and placing his joined palms upon his head, he quickly
  pressed (touched) with his head the two feet of Sugrīva.
'39': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-second canto in Sundara-kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, called “The Outcry of Dadhimukha.”
