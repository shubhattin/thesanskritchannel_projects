  Now begins the thirty-third canto, named “Censure of Ravana,” in the Aranya
  Kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana.
'1': >-
  Thereupon Surpanakha, miserable and wretched, in the midst of the ministers,
  angrily addressed Ravana—he who makes the worlds cry out—speaking harsh words.
'2': >-
  Intoxicated with the enjoyments of desire, living as you please,
  unrestrained—though a dreadful danger has arisen, which ought to be
  understood, you do not comprehend it.
'3': >-
  A king who is attached to low, worldly pleasures, who follows his lust, and is
  greedy—people do not think much of him, even as they regard the fire of a
  cremation-ground.
'4': >-
  That earthly ruler who, at the proper time, does not himself carry out the
  tasks that must be done—he perishes, together with his kingdom, and with those
  very undertakings.
'5': >-
  Men keep far away from a king whose conduct is improper, who is hard to
  approach, and who is not self-controlled—just as elephants avoid a river-bank
  of mire.
'6': >-
  Those kings who do not protect their realm, being themselves not
  self-governed—do not become illustrious through prosperity, like mountains in
  the ocean (which do not increase or rise higher).
'7': >-
  Having quarrelled with beings who are like yourself—gods, gandharvas, and
  danavas—and being of improper conduct and fickle besides, how will you be a
  king?
'8': >-
  But you, O rakshasa, are childish by nature and devoid of understanding; what
  ought to be known you do not know—how then will you be a king?
'9': >-
  O best of conquerors, those kings whose spies, treasury, and statecraft are
  not under their control are on a level with ordinary folk; they are no
  different from common men.
'10': >-
  Because kings, through their spies, behold from afar all impending calamities,
  therefore kings are called “long-sighted.”
'11': >-
  I deem you one of misguided conduct, surrounded by commonplace counsellors;
  and you do not perceive that your own people at Janasthana have been slain.
'12': >-
  Fourteen thousand rakshasas of dreadful deeds—along with Khara and
  Dushana—have been slain by Rama alone.
'13': >-
  Fearlessness has been granted to the rishis, and the Dandaka forest has been
  made secure; and Janasthana has been violated and laid waste by Rama of
  unwearied action.
'14': >-
  But you, O rakshasa—greedy, heedless, and dependent on others—do not
  understand the danger that has arisen within your own domain.
'15': >-
  Creatures do not run toward a king who is harsh, who gives little, who is
  negligent, who is arrogant, and deceitful, when calamity comes upon him.
'16': >-
  Even his own people destroy, in times of distress, a king who is excessively
  self-conceited, unapproachable, self-important, and prone to anger.
'17': >-
  He who does not carry out his duties, and does not fear dangers, quickly falls
  from sovereignty; wretched, he becomes here like a blade of grass, of no
  account.
'18': >-
  One may find use for dry sticks, and even for clods and dust; but there can be
  no use for kings who have slipped from their station as rulers of the earth.
'19': >-
  As a garment that has been worn out, or as a garland that has been crushed—so
  too, one fallen from kingship, even if capable, becomes purposeless.
'20': >-
  But the king who is vigilant, all-knowing (in matters of rule),
  self-restrained, grateful, and devoted to dharma—that king stands firm for a
  long time.
'21': >-
  Though he may sleep with his two eyes, he remains awake with the eye of
  policy; open in his wrath and in his favour, such a king is honoured by the
  people.
'22': >-
  But you, O Ravana, are of evil understanding and devoid of these virtues—hence
  the very great slaughter of the rakshasas is unknown to you through your
  spies.
'23': >-
  Despising others, attached to indulgence in sense-pleasures, not knowing the
  true division and fitness of place and time, and having unsound judgment in
  determining merit and fault—you, having a ruined kingdom, will not be long
  before you yourself fall into ruin.
'24': >-
  Thus, having had his own faults proclaimed in that manner, the lord of the
  night-rangers reflected upon them with his mind; yet endowed with wealth,
  pride, and power, that Ravana pondered long.
'25': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-third canto, named “Censure of Ravana,” in the Aranya
  Kanda of the holy Valmiki Ramayana, the Adi-Kavya.
