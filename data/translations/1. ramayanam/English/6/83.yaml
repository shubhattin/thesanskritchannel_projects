  Then, in the illustrious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  eighty-third canto, called “Rāma’s Consolation (Reassurance).”
'1': >-
  And Rāghava too, hearing that mighty tumult of battle—the terrifying din of
  war among the rākṣasas and the vānaras—addressed Jāmbavān:
'2': >-
  “Gentle one, surely Hanumān has performed a deed most difficult to accomplish;
  for, as it is heard, there has arisen a dreadful and exceedingly great clamor
  of weapons.”
'3': >-
  “Therefore go—surrounded by your own forces—and render aid at once, O lord of
  bears, to that foremost of monkeys while he is fighting.”
'4': >-
  Thus spoken to, the king of bears, encompassed by his host, went toward the
  western gate, where the vānara Hanumān was.
'5': >-
  Then the lord of bears beheld Hanumān coming—surrounded by monkeys who had
  fought in battle and were panting for breath.
'6': >-
  Seeing on the way that bear-army drawn up and advancing—terrible, dark as a
  blue rain-cloud—Hanumān checked them and turned back.
'7': >-
  He, the greatly renowned one, came swiftly with that force into Rāma’s
  presence and, distressed, spoke these words to him:
'8': >-
  “While we were looking on and our warriors were engaged in battle, Indrajit,
  Rāvaṇa’s son, struck Sītā—she who was crying—in the midst of the combat.”
'9': >-
  “On seeing her, my mind was thrown into confusion and I became despondent, O
  subduer of foes. Therefore I have come to inform you of what has occurred.”
'10': >-
  Hearing those words, Rāghava, overwhelmed by grief, fell upon the ground at
  once, like a tree cut off at the root.
'11': >-
  Seeing Rāghava—godlike in radiance—fallen upon the earth, the foremost of
  monkeys sprang up and rushed toward him from every side.
'12': >-
  They sprinkled him with waters fragrant with lotus and water-lily, as though
  seeking to cool one who blazed unendurable—like a fire suddenly kindled.
'13': >-
  Then Lakṣmaṇa, exceedingly sorrowful, embraced Rāma with both arms and spoke
  to him—who was not himself—words furnished with reason and meaning:
'14': >-
  “You stand on the auspicious path, noble one, with your senses conquered; yet
  Dharma, being ineffectual, is not able to protect you from calamities.”
'15': >-
  “The beholding of beings—both the immovable and the moving—shows that Dharma
  is not as it is said to be; therefore, in my judgment, it does not exist.”
'16': >-
  “For the immovable is manifest, and the moving is of the same nature; but this
  consequence is not rightly fitting—that one like you should come to ruin.”
'17': >-
  “If unrighteousness were a real thing, Rāvaṇa would go to hell; and you,
  endowed with righteousness, would never fall into misfortune.”
'18': >-
  “But when there is no misfortune for him, and misfortune has come upon you,
  Dharma and Adharma become mutually contradictory.”
'19': >-
  “One should obtain Dharma by Dharma, and Adharma by Adharma—if those in whom
  Adharma is established were truly joined to Adharma (in their results).”
'20': >-
  “People who delight in unrighteousness would never be separated from Dharma;
  and for those who practice Dharma, the fruit would indeed be according to
  Dharma.”
'21': >-
  “Since prosperity increases where Adharma is established, and those devoted to
  Dharma are afflicted, therefore both of these (Dharma and Adharma) are without
  efficacy.”
'22': >-
  “If the doers of evil are slain by unrighteousness, O Rāghava, then when
  Adharma itself is struck down by the act of slaying—being slain, whom will it
  slay?”
'23': >-
  “Or else, this man is slain by what is ordained, and he slays another by what
  is ordained. It is that Ordination (Fate) which becomes tainted by it, not he
  by that sinful deed.”
'24': >-
  “By Dharma—whose counteraction is unseen, which is unmanifest and unreal, yet
  presented as real—how can one attain the supreme goal, O drawer away of
  enemies?”
'25': >-
  “If what is real were real, O foremost among the good, nothing unreal would
  befall you. Since such a thing has happened to you, it follows that it is not
  as they say.”
'26': >-
  “Or perhaps Dharma follows after strength, being weak and impotent. The weak,
  having lost all bounds, is not to be served—so is my opinion.”
'27': >-
  “If Dharma is but an attribute of strength, brought about by valor, then
  casting Dharma aside, act according to strength—as you have acted according to
  Dharma.”
'28': >-
  “And if truthfulness is indeed Dharma, O scorcher of foes, then what untruth
  has not been committed by you, when you refrained from (what was required)?”
'29': >-
  “If Dharma or Adharma were truly existent, O scorcher of foes, then the
  wielder of the thunderbolt (Indra) would not, after slaying a sage, perform
  sacrifice—the rite of the lord of a hundred sacrifices.”
'30': >-
  “Dharma, when resorting to Adharma, destroys, O Rāghava. Thus all this comes
  about according to one’s will; man acts as he pleases, O Kakutstha.”
'31': >-
  “This is my view, dear brother—what is called ‘Dharma,’ O Rāghava: for you cut
  off the very root of Dharma when you abandoned the kingdom then.”
'32': >-
  “From wealth, when it has grown and been accumulated here and there, all
  undertakings proceed—like rivers flowing forth from mountains.”
'33': >-
  “For a man of small understanding who is deprived of wealth, all activities
  are cut off—like a petty stream in summer.”
'34': >-
  “He who, having renounced wealth, desires pleasures and is inflated by
  pleasures, then practices sin; from that, fault proceeds.”
'35': >-
  “He who has wealth has friends; he who has wealth has kinsmen. He who has
  wealth is a man in the world; he who has wealth is also a learned man.”
'36': >-
  “He who has wealth is also valiant; he who has wealth is also intelligent. He
  who has wealth is fortunate; he who has wealth excels in qualities.”
'37': >-
  “These faults arising from the abandonment of wealth have been declared by
  me—O steadfast one—by which you formed the resolve to relinquish the kingdom.”
'38': >-
  “He who has wealth has Dharma, kāma, and artha all moving in his favor. For
  one who seeks artha and kāma while being without riches, artha cannot be
  obtained.”
'39': >-
  “Joy, desire, pride, righteousness, anger, tranquility, and self-control—all
  these arise from wealth, O lord of men.”
'40': >-
  “Those riches, by which this world does not perish for those who walk in the
  ways of Dharma, are not seen in you—like planets on days of heavy cloud.”
'41': >-
  “When you, O hero, went to the forest, abiding by the word of the guru, your
  wife—dearer to you than life—was carried off by a rākṣasa.”
'42': >-
  “And now today, O mighty hero, vast sorrow has been wrought by Indrajit. By my
  action I shall dispel it; therefore arise, O Rāghava!”
'43': >-
  “Rise, tiger among men—long-armed, steadfast in vows! Why do you not
  understand your own self—the great-souled one—as yourself?”
'44': >-
  “Blameless one, provoked by this outrage done to you—the killing of Sītā, the
  daughter of Janaka, for the sake of what is dear to you—I shall utterly cast
  down Laṅkā, together with its chariots, elephants, and horses, and with its
  rākṣasa-lords, with a torrent of arrows.”
'45': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-third canto, called “Rāma’s Consolation (Reassurance),”
  in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic.
