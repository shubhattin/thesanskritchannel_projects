  Then, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the
  thirty-seventh canto, named “The Disposition of Rāma’s Battle-Formations
  (Rāma-gulma-vibhāga),” begins.
'1': >-
  Then there were those two royal leaders of men and monkeys—Sugrīva, and that
  monkey, the son of the Wind-god (Hanumān); and Jāmbavān, the king of bears;
  and Vibhīṣaṇa also, the rākṣasa.
'2': >-
  Aṅgada, the son of Vālī; and Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa); and the monkey Śarabha;
  Suṣeṇa together with his kinsmen; and Mainda, and Dvivida as well.
'3': >-
  Gaja, Gavākṣa, Kumuda, and Nala, and also Panasa—having reached the enemy’s
  domain—assembled together, ready and able for the task.
'4': >-
  “This is Laṅkā that is seen before us—the city protected and ruled by
  Rāvaṇa—hard to conquer even for the gods, together with the asuras, nāgas,
  gandharvas, and even the immortals.”
'5': >-
  “Keeping the accomplishment of the undertaking in view, deliberate and arrive
  at a decision, for Rāvaṇa, lord of the rākṣasas, is ever present there.”
'6': >-
  While they were thus speaking, Rāvaṇa’s younger brother
  spoke—Vibhīṣaṇa—uttering words that were not coarse, rich in meaning, and full
  in import.
'7': >-
  “Anala and Panasa, and also Sampāti and Pramati—my ministers—went to Laṅkā,
  and returned again here after surveying the city.”
'8': >-
  “All of them, assuming the forms of birds, entered into the enemy’s forces;
  and having seen the dispositions that were made and the arrangements that were
  set in place, they have now come back and stand before us.”
'9': >-
  “As they have reported the array and ordering of that wicked-souled Rāvaṇa—O
  Rāma—hear from me everything they said, exactly as it is.”
'10': >-
  “First, Prahasta, with his forces, has taken his stand at the eastern gate;
  and on the southern side are the two of great prowess and mighty
  valor—Mahāpārśva and Mahodara.”
'11': >-
  “At the western gate stands Indrajit, surrounded by many rākṣasas—men bearing
  axes and swords and bows, holding tridents and clubs in their hands.”
'12': >-
  “Rāvaṇa’s son is encompassed by heroes with weapons of many kinds—indeed, by
  many thousands of rākṣasas, all weapon-in-hand.”
'13': >-
  “Well-ordered, exceedingly vigilant, and skilled in counsel together with the
  rākṣasas, Rāvaṇa himself has stationed himself at the northern city-gate.”
'14': >-
  “But Virūpākṣa, with a great force of rākṣasas, bearing trident, sword, and
  bow, has occupied the central battle-division.”
'15': >-
  “Having thus observed these dispositions of battle-divisions in Laṅkā, all my
  ministers swiftly returned again here to me.”
'16': >-
  “There are ten thousand elephants, and ten thousand chariots likewise; and
  twice ten thousand horses; and rākṣasas to the measure of a crore and more.”
'17': >-
  “Valiant and powerful, ever intent on battle, assailants in combats—these
  night-rangers are always dear to the rākṣasa-king.”
'18': >-
  “For each single rākṣasa here, O lord of men, when it comes to warfare, an
  entourage of a thousand thousands—that is, a million—waits in attendance.”
'19': >-
  Vibhīṣaṇa thus described to the mighty-armed one the situation in Laṅkā as
  declared by the ministers, and having spoken so, he pointed out those
  rākṣasas.
'20': >-
  He reported to Rāma everything ascertained in Laṅkā through the ministers, and
  then spoke this further to lotus-eyed Rāma.
'21': >-
  That illustrious younger brother of Rāvaṇa, wishing to do what was pleasing to
  Rāma, said: “When, O Rāma, Rāvaṇa once fought against Kubera,”
'22': >-
  “then sixty hundreds of thousands of rākṣasas—six million—marched forth:
  resembling here (these present forces) in valor, heroism, splendor, and proud
  self-confidence, and equal in arrogance to that wicked-souled Rāvaṇa.”
'23': >-
  “Here there is no need for anger; I do not provoke you nor do I frighten you.
  By valor you are capable even of subduing the gods.”
'24': >-
  “Therefore you, surrounded by a vast army of four divisions, having arranged
  and arrayed this monkey host, will grind down and destroy Rāvaṇa.”
'25': >-
  As Rāvaṇa’s younger brother spoke thus, Rāghava (Rāma), for the sake of
  striking down the enemies, spoke these words in reply.
'26': >-
  “At the eastern gate of Laṅkā, Nīla, the foremost of monkeys, surrounded by
  many monkeys, shall fight Prahasta.”
'27': >-
  “Aṅgada, the son of Vālī, surrounded by a great force, shall press the
  southern gate and oppose Mahāpārśva and Mahodara.”
'28': >-
  “Hanumān, the son of the Wind, of immeasurable might, surrounded by many
  monkeys, shall crush the western gate and enter.”
'29': >-
  “He who is hateful to brahmins and dear to perversity, mean-minded, endowed
  with the strength of boons—who ranges about troubling the hosts of daityas and
  dānavas, and also the great-souled ṛṣis,”
'30': >-
  “and who, tormenting the peoples, traverses all the worlds—of that lord of
  rākṣasas I myself have taken upon me the slaying.”
'31': >-
  “I, together with Saumitri (Lakṣmaṇa), shall press and force entry by the
  northern city-gate, with our forces, where Rāvaṇa is stationed.”
'32': >-
  “Let the powerful king of monkeys (Sugrīva), the valorous king of bears
  (Jāmbavān), and also the younger brother of the rākṣasa-king (Vibhīṣaṇa) be in
  the middle battle-division.”
'33': >-
  “And in this battle, the monkeys should not assume a human form in combat. Let
  this be our agreed sign in this war within the monkey host.”
'34': >-
  “Monkeys alone shall be our distinguishing mark among our own people in this
  host. We, however, in human form alone—seven of us—shall fight the foes.”
'35': >-
  “I myself, together with my brother Lakṣmaṇa of great prowess, and myself as
  the fifth, and this friend of mine, Vibhīṣaṇa—”
'36': >-
  Having thus spoken to Vibhīṣaṇa for the successful accomplishment of the task,
  that wise and lordly Rāma formed the resolve to ascend Suvela, beholding the
  exceedingly charming slope of Mount Suvela.
'37': >-
  Then the great-souled Rāma, covering the entire earth with a mighty host,
  delighted in aspect, approached Laṅkā—having fixed his resolve upon the
  destruction of the foe, that great-souled one.
'38': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-seventh canto, named “The Disposition of Rāma’s
  Battle-Formations,” in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primordial epic.
