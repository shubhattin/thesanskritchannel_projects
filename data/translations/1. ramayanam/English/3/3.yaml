  Now begins the third sarga, named “The Striking of Virādha,” in the
  Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa. (3-3)
'1': >-
  Then Virādha again spoke, filling the forest with his voice: “Tell me—when I
  am asking you—who are you two, and where are you going?”
'2': >-
  Thereupon Rāma, of exceedingly great splendour, spoke to that rākṣasa whose
  face was aflame, as he questioned them—Rāma, born in his own Ikṣvāku line.
'3': >-
  “Know us to be kṣatriyas, endowed with right conduct and noble qualities,
  roaming in the forest. But we wish to know you—who are you that move about in
  the Daṇḍaka woods?”
'4': >-
  Then Virādha said to Rāma, whose prowess was true and unfailing: “Well then, O
  King—understand; I shall tell you. Listen to me, O Rāghava.”
'5': >-
  “I am, they say, the son of Java; my mother is Śatahradā. All the rākṣasas
  upon the earth call me by the name Virādha.”
'6': >-
  “And through austerities I have obtained a boon born of Brahmā’s favour:
  invulnerability in the world from weapons, and the state of being uncuttable
  and unpierceable as well.”
'7': >-
  “Abandon this woman and depart without concern, just as you came. Flee
  swiftly—lest I take away your lives.”
'8': >-
  To him Rāma replied thus, his eyes reddened with anger—addressing that
  misshapen rākṣasa Virādha, of sinful mind:
'9': >-
  “Wretched one—shame upon you! Devoid of true aim, you surely seek your own
  death. Stand firm! In battle you shall meet it; you will not be released alive
  by me.”
'10': >-
  Then Rāma, stringing his bow, and fitting very sharp arrows, swiftly taking
  aim, struck the rākṣasa indeed.
'11': >-
  With his bow whose string was drawn tight, he discharged seven
  arrows—golden-fletched, of great speed and force, like Garuḍa and the wind in
  their swiftness.
'12': >-
  Those arrows, having pierced Virādha’s body—he who was clad in
  peacock-feathers—fell upon the ground, smeared with blood, glowing like fire.
'13': >-
  Struck, the rākṣasa set down Vaidehī, lifted up his spear, and then,
  exceedingly enraged, rushed upon Rāma together with Lakṣmaṇa.
'14': >-
  Roaring with a mighty cry, grasping that spear like Indra’s banner, he shone
  then—his mouth gaping wide—like Death himself.
'15': >-
  Then the two brothers poured forth a blazing rain of arrows upon that rākṣasa
  Virādha, who was like Yama, the finisher at the end of time.
'16': >-
  That exceedingly dreadful rākṣasa laughed aloud, stood his ground, and yawned;
  and as he yawned, those swift arrows came out from his body (as though
  expelled).
'17': >-
  But by the touch of that boon, the rākṣasa Virādha held his life-breaths fast,
  raised his spear, and charged at the two Rāghavas.
'18': >-
  That spear, resembling a thunderbolt, blazing in the sky like fire—Rāma, best
  among weapon-bearers, cut it in two with a pair of arrows.
'19': >-
  Cut by the sharp arrows of Rāma, that spear fell to the earth—like a mountain
  crag from Meru, severed by a thunderbolt.
'20': >-
  Then, quickly lifting their swords—like two black serpents rearing up—they
  swiftly drew near him and struck with force.
'21': >-
  Being struck very fiercely, that furious one seized them both with his arms,
  and wishing to depart, tried to carry off those two tiger-like men,
  unshakable.
'22': >-
  Understanding his intention, Rāma said to Lakṣmaṇa: “Let this rākṣasa carry us
  along this path for a while.”
'23': >-
  “Let the rākṣasa carry us just as he wishes, O Saumitri; for this indeed is
  our very path—the one by which this night-ranger goes.”
'24': >-
  Then the night-ranger, by his own strength and prowess, lifted them up and set
  them upon his shoulders—like two boys—exalted by his extraordinary power.
'25': >-
  Having placed the two Rāghavas upon his shoulders, Virādha the ranger of the
  night, crying out terribly, went on facing into the forest.
'26': >-
  He entered that forest, like a massive cloud in appearance—vast, furnished
  with many great trees of diverse kinds; adorned with manifold and variegated
  flocks of birds; haunted by jackals; and scattered with serpents and wild
  beasts.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the third sarga, named “The Striking of Virādha,” in the
  Araṇya-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic. (3-3)
