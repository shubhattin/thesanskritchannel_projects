  Then, in the revered Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Yuddha-kanda, begins the
  fifty-seventh chapter, called “The Battle of Prahasta.”
'1': >-
  Hearing of the slaying of Akampana, the lord of the rakshasas was indeed
  enraged; and with his face somewhat cast down in dejection as well, he looked
  upon those ministers of his.
'2': >-
  But after reflecting for a short while, and after deliberating with his
  counsellors, Ravana—lord of the rakshasas—on the following day went about the
  city of Lanka, to inspect all the military posts and detachments.
'3': >-
  He beheld that city—guarded by hosts of rakshasas and encompassed by many
  armed stations—adorned with banners and standards.
'4': >-
  Seeing that the city was hemmed in, Ravana, lord of the rakshasas, addressed,
  at the proper time and for his own advantage, Prahasta, skilled in war.
'5': >-
  “For the city, thus beset and suddenly hard-pressed, I see no deliverance
  other than battle, O you who are expert in warfare.
'6': >-
  Either I, or Kumbhakarna, or you—my commander—or Indrajit, or Nikumbha—must
  bear a burden such as this.
'7': >-
  Therefore you, taking the army quickly and assuming command of it, march forth
  for victory to the place where all those forest-dwellers are gathered.
'8': >-
  By your very going forth, swiftly the monkey host will be set in motion and
  will flee, on hearing the roar of the rakshasa lords as they bellow.
'9': >-
  For the vanaras are fickle and undisciplined and of wavering minds; they will
  not endure that roar—like elephants unable to bear a lion’s roar.
'10': >-
  And when that force has been put to flight, Rama, together with Saumitri,
  helpless and without support, will come under your power, O Prahasta.
'11': >-
  In calamity, what is truly beneficial is uncertain; here nothing is
  established beyond doubt. Considering both the adverse and the favourable, do
  whatever you deem to be for our good.”
'12': >-
  Thus addressed by Ravana, Prahasta, the lord of the host, spoke to the king of
  rakshasas—like Shukra speaking to the king of asuras.
'13': >-
  “O King, we have previously consulted with wise counsellors among our
  ministers; and debate too has arisen among us, after weighing matters against
  one another.
'14': >-
  I have determined that the best course lies in giving Sita back; but if she is
  not given, then battle is indeed what we see before us, as in the same manner
  it has come to be for us.
'15': >-
  I—ever honoured by you with gifts, with respect, and with various conciliatory
  words at the proper time—how could I not do what is for your welfare?
'16': >-
  For to me, life is not something to be preserved—nor sons, nor wife, nor
  wealth. Behold me, ready to offer my very life in battle for your sake.
'17': >-
  Having thus spoken to his lord Ravana, Prahasta, the commander of the host,
  then addressed the leaders of the forces standing before him.
'18': >-
  “Bring to me quickly the mighty strength of the rakshasas—so that, by the
  force of my arrows, they may be slain upon the battlefield.
'19': >-
  Today let the flesh-eating birds of the forest be satisfied!” Hearing those
  words of his, the mighty commanders of the troops
'20': >-
  set the forces in readiness within that rakshasa palace; and in but a moment
  there arose a fearful array, equipped with weapons of many kinds.
'21': >-
  Lanka became crowded with those rakshasa heroes, as though with elephants in
  tumult—while some satisfied the sacred fire and others bowed to brahmanas.
'22': >-
  A fragrant wind, bearing the scent of ghee, blew; and garlands of diverse
  forms were taken up, after being consecrated with mantras.
'23': >-
  Then the rakshasas—delighted and ready for battle—put on their gear; bearing
  bows, clad in armour, the rakshasas leapt forward in haste.
'24': >-
  Gazing upon King Ravana, they surrounded Prahasta. Then, after taking leave of
  the king, and having struck a dreadful war-drum,
'25': >-
  Prahasta ascended his chariot, yoked and fully prepared—drawn by horses of
  great speed, well driven by a capable charioteer, and excellently controlled.
'26': >-
  It resounded like a great thundercloud, and shone as if with the splendour of
  the sun and moon; it was hard to assail, bearing a banner marked with
  serpents, having fine defences and excellent fittings.
'27': >-
  Adorned with nets of gold, it seemed to laugh with prosperity. Then, mounting
  that chariot and invested with Ravana’s command,
'28': >-
  he swiftly went forth from Lanka, surrounded by a great army. Thereupon arose
  the sound of kettledrums, like the rumbling of rain-clouds, and the clamor of
  instruments, as though filling the whole earth.
'29': >-
  The sound of conches too was heard as the commander marched out; and before
  him the rakshasas went, uttering terrible cries.
'30': >-
  Of dreadful forms and huge bodies, marching in front of Prahasta—Narantaka,
  Kumbhahanu, and Mahanada, towering in might—these were Prahasta’s attendants;
  surrounding him, they went forth.
'31': >-
  With a dreadful battle-formation itself, he marched out by the eastern gate,
  encompassed by a great force resembling a herd of elephants.
'32': >-
  Encircled by that army, like an ocean-flood, Prahasta went forth in wrath,
  resembling Yama, the ender of time.
'33': >-
  By the tumult of his departure and the roaring of the rakshasas, all beings in
  Lanka cried out in distorted sounds.
'34': >-
  Entering the sky, flesh-and-blood-eating birds made inauspicious circles on
  the left, turning toward the chariot.
'35': >-
  Terrible jackals howled, spewing flames of fire; a meteor fell from the sky,
  and the wind blew harshly.
'36': >-
  The planets, agitated against one another, did not shine; and clouds with
  harsh thunder sounded above the rakshasa’s chariot.
'37': >-
  They rained blood upon him and bespattered those in front; and on the head of
  the banner a vulture, sinking down, faced south.
'38': >-
  Bellowing from both sides, it carried away his full prosperity; and again and
  again, as he plunged into battle, misfortune beset his charioteer.
'39': >-
  The goad fell from the hand of the charioteer who urged the horses; and that
  radiance of departure—bright and exceedingly rare—
'40': >-
  vanished in a moment, and on level ground the horses stumbled. As that
  Prahasta, famed for virtues and prowess, came forth, the monkey army met him
  in battle with weapons of many kinds.
'41': >-
  Then there arose a very mighty uproar among the monkeys—of those breaking
  trees and of those seizing heavy rocks.
'42': >-
  Amid the roaring of the rakshasas and the shouting of the vanaras, both armies
  were exultant—those troops of rakshasas and those forest-dwellers.
'43': >-
  Of warriors swift and capable, desiring one another’s death and challenging
  one another face to face, a great din is heard.
'44': >-
  Then Prahasta, of perverse intent, advanced for victory against the
  monkey-king’s host; and he entered that army of ever-increasing fury, like a
  moth rushing into a blazing fire.
'45': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-seventh chapter of the Yuddha-kanda in the revered
  Valmiki-Ramayana, the primeval epic, called “The Battle of Prahasta.”
