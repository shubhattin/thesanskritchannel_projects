  Now begins the one-hundred-and-sixteenth sarga (chapter) of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa
  of the holy Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Account Concerning Khara.”
'1': >-
  When Bharata had departed and Rāma was dwelling in the forest of austere
  penance, he observed in the ascetics a certain agitation and an eager
  restlessness.
'2': >-
  Those who, in the hermitage before Chitrakūṭa, had taken refuge in Rāma and
  were devoted to him—Rāma noticed them to be full of anxious expectation.
'3': >-
  Pointing toward Rāma with their eyes and with knitted brows, and being
  suspicious and apprehensive, they spoke to one another in low tones and held
  whispered conversations among themselves.
'4': >-
  Perceiving their anxiety, Rāma himself became inwardly doubtful; and with
  joined palms he then addressed that sage, the head of the hermitage, saying:
'5': >-
  “Revered sir, is there in me any fault, any former deed, that is seen to have
  become distorted, by reason of which these ascetics are so troubled?”
'6': >-
  “Has anything been done through heedlessness by my younger brother—by
  Lakṣmaṇa—that has been observed by the sages as somehow unbecoming to his own
  nature?”
'7': >-
  “Or has Sītā, though intent on serving you and devoted to service, through
  inadvertence failed to maintain toward me the conduct that is proper and
  befitting?”
'8': >-
  Then the sage, aged with years and worn by austerity, spoke to Rāma—who was
  compassionate to all beings—his body as though trembling:
'9': >-
  “How, dear child, could there be any wavering in Vaidehī—she whose disposition
  is auspicious and who delights in what is auspicious—especially with respect
  to the ascetics?”
'10': >-
  “This matter, however, concerns the ascetics on your account. Therefore,
  alarmed by the rākṣasas, they speak together in anxious counsel.”
'11': >-
  “There is here a rākṣasa named Khara, a certain younger brother of Rāvaṇa,
  dwelling at Janasthāna; he has been uprooting and harassing all the ascetics.”
'12': >-
  “He is audacious, a conqueror of Kāśī, cruel, a devourer of men; arrogant and
  sinful—and, dear child, he cannot endure you.”
'13': >-
  “From the time, dear child, that you have been living in this hermitage, from
  that very time the rākṣasas have been afflicting the ascetics.”
'14': >-
  “Indeed, they show themselves in many disgusting forms—cruel and terrifying—of
  various shapes, deformed and hideous to behold.”
'15': >-
  “And having yoked the ascetics to base and impure acts, those unrighteous
  ones, standing right before them, quickly strike down other ascetics as well.”
'16': >-
  “In this hermitage-place and in that, creeping in unnoticed, those men of
  little understanding take pleasure in destroying the ascetics there.”
'17': >-
  “They throw down the ladles and vessels for sacrifice; they drench the sacred
  fires with water; and they smash the pots when the offering is about to be
  performed.”
'18': >-
  “Because our hermitages have been violated by those evil-souled ones, the
  sages, desiring to abandon these dwellings, are today urging me to go to
  another region.”
'19': >-
  “Formerly, Rāma, those wicked ones inflicted bodily violence upon the
  ascetics; therefore we shall forsake this hermitage.”
'20': >-
  “Not far from here is a wondrous forest rich in roots and fruits; along with
  my company I shall once more resort to that ancient hermitage.”
'21': >-
  “But Khara’s hostility toward you as well, dear child, has long been set in
  motion. If your resolve inclines so, then depart from here together with us.”
'22': >-
  “For one who is with wife, O Rāghava, there is ever a cause for apprehension.
  Even though you are capable, dwelling here today will be a painful residence
  for you.”
'23': >-
  Thus addressed by that ascetic, the royal prince Rāma—his concern
  aroused—could not restrain him with further words in reply.
'24': >-
  Having expressed assent, taken leave, and composed Rāghava’s mind, the head of
  the hermitage departed, abandoning the āśrama together with his clans and
  followers.
'25': >-
  Then Rāma, having duly seen to the company of sages as they proceeded in
  departure from that place, having saluted the head of the hermitage—himself a
  sage—being rightly permitted by them who were well pleased, and having been
  instructed in what was to be done, returned to his own sacred abode for
  dwelling.
'26': >-
  But the lord Rāghava did not abandon that hermitage, even for a moment, though
  it was bereft of sages; for the ascetics—endowed with the virtues born of
  ṛṣi-like conduct—continually followed after Rāghava.
'27': >-
  Thus ends the one-hundred-and-sixteenth sarga of the Ayodhya-kāṇḍa of the holy
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Account Concerning Khara.”
