  Now begins the fifteenth sarga in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, called “The Dispute between Indrajit and Vibhīṣaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Hearing with care those words of Vibhīṣaṇa—whose counsel was equal to that of
  Bṛhaspati—Indrajit, the foremost leader of the Rākṣasa hosts, that
  great-souled one, then spoke these words there.
'2': >-
  “What indeed is this speech of yours, dear younger uncle—so purposeless, and
  spoken as though out of great fear? In this lineage, whoever may have been
  born, none would speak thus, nor would any act in such a manner.”
'3': >-
  “By courage, by prowess, by valour, by steadfastness, by heroism, and by
  splendour—there is but one man in this lineage who is bereft of these:
  Vibhīṣaṇa, dear younger uncle, even you!”
'4': >-
  “What are those two sons of a human king to us, when opposed by even a single
  Rākṣasa? Even by one of ordinary might one could slay them—why, then, do you,
  being fearful, seek to frighten us?”
'5': >-
  “Truly the lord of the three worlds, the king of the gods—Śakra himself—was
  made by me to sit upon the ground; and even the quarters, seized by fear,
  sought refuge; and then all the hosts of gods together were struck with
  terror.”
'6': >-
  “Even Airāvata, trumpeting loudly, was cast down by me upon the earth; and
  wrenching out his tusks by force, I put to fear the entire host of the gods.”
'7': >-
  “I am the crusher of the pride even of the Suras, and the maker of sorrow even
  to the foremost of the Dānavas; how could I, a man of great might, be unable
  to subdue the two sons of a human king—mere mortals of common nature?”
'8': >-
  Hearing those words of Indrajit—mighty as Indra, unassailable, of great
  energy—Vibhīṣaṇa, best among bearers of weapons, then spoke words of deep
  import.
'9': >-
  “Dear one, there is no settled discernment in your counsel; even today you are
  but a child, your understanding unripe. Therefore you have spoken at length
  words that are devoid of meaning, tending only to your own destruction.”
'10': >-
  “By the mere claim of being Rāvaṇa’s son, O Indrajit, you are an enemy who
  wears the face of a friend—since, upon hearing of such ruin to Rāghava, you,
  through delusion, approve of it.”
'11': >-
  “You yourself are fit to be slain, and of utterly perverse mind; and he too is
  fit to be slain who brought you here—who today, obstinately, thrust a
  child—reckless and headstrong—into the midst of those skilled in counsel.”
'12': >-
  “Foolish, untrained, possessed of ill-breeding, of harsh disposition, of
  little understanding, wicked-souled—utterly dull and of grievously misguided
  intellect—you, O Indrajit, speak thus because of your childishness.”
'13': >-
  “Let us offer to Rāma the goddess Sītā, along with wealth, jewels, excellent
  ornaments, divine garments, and wondrous gems; and then, O King, let us dwell
  here free from sorrow.”
'14': >-
  Thus ends the fifteenth sarga in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Dispute between Indrajit and
  Vibhīṣaṇa.”
