  Now begins the one hundred and ninth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the holy
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Felling of Rāvaṇa’s Banner.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon, between Rāma and Rāvaṇa, there commenced a most dreadful and
  violent chariot-battle—exceedingly great, and bringing fear to all the worlds.
'2': >-
  Then the vast army of the rākṣasas and the great host of the monkeys, with
  weapons seized and held ready, became motionless, standing as if stupefied.
'3': >-
  Beholding those two mighty ones—the man and the rākṣasa—engaged in close
  combat, all the warriors, their hearts shaken and agitated, were struck with
  the highest amazement.
'4': >-
  With arms busy in many kinds of weapons, and with minds bewildered in wonder,
  they stood watching the battle, and did not advance against one another.
'5': >-
  As they looked on with astonished eyes—Rāvaṇa among the rākṣasas and Rāghava
  among the vānaras—the whole army appeared like a painted picture.
'6': >-
  But Rāghava and Rāvaṇa, seeing there on that field the portents and signs,
  resolute in purpose and steadfast in wrath, fought on fearlessly.
'7': >-
  Thinking, “I must conquer,” the descendant of Kakutstha, and thinking, “I must
  die,” Rāvaṇa—both then displayed in that battle the entirety of their valor
  and prowess as their sole possession.
'8': >-
  Then, out of anger, the valiant Ten-necked one, fixing his arrows, discharged
  them aiming at the banner of Rāghava that stood upon his chariot.
'9': >-
  But those arrows, not reaching that banner on the chariot (like that of
  Purandara), struck instead the mighty chariot-pole and fell down upon the
  earth.
'10': >-
  Then Rāma too, enraged, drew his bow, mighty in strength, and in his mind set
  about to make due requital in return.
'11': >-
  Aiming at Rāvaṇa’s banner, he released a keen arrow—unendurable like a great
  serpent, blazing with its own splendor.
'12': >-
  The radiant Rāma hurled that shaft at the standard; and the arrow, cleaving
  down to the earth, severed the banner of the Ten-necked one.
'13': >-
  Cut off, Rāvaṇa’s chariot-banner fell upon the ground. Seeing the felling of
  his standard, the mighty-armed Rāvaṇa—
'14': >-
  —became inflamed with rage and intolerant fury, as though burning everything;
  and, having come under the sway of wrath, he poured forth a rain of arrows.
'15': >-
  Rāvaṇa pierced Rāma’s horses with blazing shafts; yet those divine steeds
  there neither stumbled nor reeled.
'16': >-
  They remained calm of heart, as though struck merely with lotus-stalks. Seeing
  that unshaken steadiness of the horses, Rāvaṇa then—
'17': >-
  —grew furious all the more and again let loose a shower of arrows, and also
  maces, iron clubs, discus-weapons, and mallets.
'18': >-
  He caused to fall—by magical artifice—this downpour of weapons: mountain-peaks
  and trees, and likewise tridents, axes, and swords; and, with unwearied heart
  and effort, he hurled thousands of arrows at that time.
'19': >-
  That storm of weapons in battle became tumultuous, terror-producing, dreadful,
  and with a fearsome din—an immense downpour made of many kinds of weapons.
'20': >-
  Released all around the chariot of Rāghava and amid the monkey host, those
  missiles made even the sky densely packed and without any gap.
'21': >-
  And the Ten-necked one discharged them with inward detachment and an
  unfettered spirit; seeing Rāvaṇa thus straining and intent in the battle—
'22': >-
  —the descendant of Kakutstha, as though laughing, set keen arrows to his bow
  and then released shafts by hundreds and even by thousands.
'23': >-
  Seeing them, Rāvaṇa in turn filled the sky without interval with his own
  arrows; and by that brilliant rain of arrows launched by both of them—
'24': >-
  —the shining firmament appeared as though bound fast with arrows, like a
  second radiant sky. No arrow was without its mark; none was without a piercer;
  none was fruitless.
'25': >-
  As the arrows of Rāma and Rāvaṇa were thus discharged in that conflict,
  striking one another, they fell down upon the earth.
'26': >-
  Unbrokenly they continued to fight, casting their shafts left and right, and
  with their terrible arrows they made the sky seem as though robbed of breath.
'27': >-
  Rāma slew Rāvaṇa’s horses, and Rāvaṇa slew Rāma’s horses—each doing to the
  other what the other did, returning deed for deed.
'28': >-
  Thus those two, exceedingly enraged, waged that supreme battle. For a while
  the combat became tumultuous and hair-raising.
'29': >-
  Thus ends the one hundred and ninth sarga of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the venerable
  Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the primeval epic, entitled “The Felling of Rāvaṇa’s
  Banner.”
