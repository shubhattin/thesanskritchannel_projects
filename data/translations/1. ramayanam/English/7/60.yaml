  Now begins the sixtieth sarga of the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the glorious Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Coming of Bhārgava Chyavana and the Ṛṣis.”

  While Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were thus conversing, the spring night arrived—neither
  cold nor heat-giving.
'2': >-
  Then, when the clear morning dawned, the descendant of Kakutstha, having duly
  performed the rites of the early forenoon, set forth to appear before the
  citizens, being well aware of the duties of kings toward the people.
'3': >-
  Thereupon Sumantra came and spoke these words to Rāghava: “O King, ascetics
  whose way is hard to withstand stand at the gate; they have been obstructed
  there.”
'4': >-
  “The great ṛṣis, having placed Bhārgava Chyavana in the forefront, are
  hastening and urge an audience with the great king. They are well-disposed
  toward you, O tiger among men—those dwellers on the banks of the Yamunā.”
'5': >-
  Hearing Sumantra’s words, Rāma, knower of dharma, said: “Let those highly
  fortunate brāhmaṇas, headed by Bhārgava, be admitted.”
'6': >-
  Acting upon the king’s command, the doorkeeper, with joined palms raised to
  his head in reverence, then ushered in those ascetics, difficult of approach.
'7': >-
  There entered the royal palace a hundred and more great-souled ascetics,
  radiant with their own spiritual lustre.
'8': >-
  Those twice-born sages brought many offerings to Rāma—full water-pots honored
  with waters from all sacred fords, and also fruits and roots.
'9': >-
  Rāma, placing his delight in the forefront, received all of it—the sacred
  waters from the tīrthas and the various fruits as well.
'10': >-
  Then the mighty-armed one spoke to all the great sages: “Let these foremost of
  seats be brought; be seated according to your worth.”
'11': >-
  Hearing Rāma’s words, all those great ṛṣis sat down upon the splendid golden
  seats.
'12': >-
  Seeing the ṛṣis seated there, Rāghava, the conqueror of hostile cities,
  composed and with palms joined, spoke these words:
'13': >-
  “For what purpose have you come? What shall I do, being attentive and
  prepared? I am to be commanded by the great ṛṣis, and I am able to fulfil all
  desires with ease.”
'14': >-
  “This entire kingdom, and even my life—held and treasured in my heart—I
  declare to you in truth: all this is for you for these two ends,”
'15': >-
  On hearing those words of his, a great cry of approval arose among the
  fierce-penanced ṛṣis dwelling on the bank of the Yamunā.
'16': >-
  And those great-souled ones, filled with great joy, said: “It is fitting, O
  best of men; such conduct belongs to you alone upon earth, and to none other.”
'17': >-
  “Many mighty kings, O ruler of men, have passed away; deeming the weightiness
  of the task, they did not assent to such a pledge.”
'18': >-
  “But you, out of reverence for brāhmaṇas, have made this vow without
  considering its cause; therefore you are indeed the doer of it—there is no
  doubt. You ought to protect the ṛṣis from a great terror.”
'19': >-
  Thus ends the sixtieth sarga of the Uttara Kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Coming of Bhārgava Chyavana and
  the Ṛṣis.”
