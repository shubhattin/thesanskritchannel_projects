  Now begins the Twelfth Sarga in the Kishkindha-kanda of the illustrious
  Valmiki Ramayana, entitled “The Giving of Assurance to Sugriva.”
'1': >-
  Hearing these well-spoken words of Sugriva, the mighty-armed Rama, in order to
  give him sure proof (of his prowess), took up his bow.
'2': >-
  Taking in hand that dreadful bow, O bestower of honor, and also a single
  arrow, he aimed at a sala tree and discharged it, filling the quarters with
  the roar (of the missile).
'3': >-
  That arrow, driven forth with great force, and adorned with gold, pierced
  through the sala trees and the mountain-slope, and then entered into the
  earth—through seven (layers) indeed.
'4': >-
  That swift-flying shaft, within a mere moment, having pierced the sala trees,
  leapt forth again and entered that very quiver once more.
'5': >-
  Seeing those seven sala trees pierced through, Sugriva, the foremost of the
  monkeys, was seized with the utmost astonishment at the speed of Rama’s arrow.
'6': >-
  Sugriva, his ornaments hanging loose, fell with his head to the ground; and,
  exceedingly delighted, he stood with folded palms before Raghava.
'7': >-
  Then, gladdened by that deed, he spoke these words to Rama—knower of dharma,
  established in heroism, and foremost among all who know the use of weapons:
'8': >-
  “O bull among men, with your arrows you are able, in battle, to slay even
  Indra along with all the hosts of the gods—how much more then Vali, O lord!”
'9': >-
  “You by whom, O Kakutstha, with a single arrow the seven great sala trees, the
  mountain, and the earth were rent asunder—who could stand before you in the
  forefront of battle?”
'10': >-
  “Today my sorrow has departed; today my joy is supreme, having obtained you as
  a friend—like unto Mahendra and Varuna.”
'11': >-
  “Therefore, even today, for my sake, slay that enemy of mine, who bears the
  form of a brother—Vali, O Kakutstha; with these folded palms am I bound (in
  supplication).”
'12': >-
  Then Rama, the great-minded, embraced Sugriva of pleasing appearance, and
  replied with words—Lakshmana standing by.
'13': >-
  “From here let us go to Kishkindha. Do you go quickly in front; and having
  gone, O Sugriva, challenge Vali, who has the scent (semblance) of a brother.”
'14': >-
  Then all of them went swiftly to Kishkindha, the city of Vali; and, covering
  themselves with trees, they stood concealed in a dense part of the forest.
'15': >-
  Sugriva too roared terribly, for the sake of calling Vali—drawing in his
  breath with force, as though with his cries he would split the very sky.
'16': >-
  Hearing the roar of his brother, Vali of great might, enraged, sprang forth in
  extreme fury—like the sun rising from the edge of the eastern mountain.
'17': >-
  Thereupon a most tumultuous battle arose between Vali and Sugriva, terrible
  like the combat in the sky between the planets Mercury and Mars.
'18': >-
  With palm-blows like thunderbolts, and with fists like adamant, the two
  brothers—stupefied with wrath—struck each other in battle.
'19': >-
  Then Rama, bow in hand, watched them both—two heroes alike to one another,
  like the twin gods, the Ashvins.
'20': >-
  Since Raghava could not distinguish Sugriva from Vali, therefore he did not
  resolve to release that death-dealing arrow.
'21': >-
  In the meantime Sugriva, beaten down by Vali, not seeing Raghava as his
  protector, fled toward Rishyamuka.
'22': >-
  Weary, his limbs drenched in blood, shattered by blows, and pursued by Vali in
  anger, he entered the great forest.
'23': >-
  Seeing him entered into the forest, Vali then, through fear of the curse
  (attached to that place), turned back; and saying, “You are free indeed,” the
  mighty one desisted.
'24': >-
  Raghava also, together with his brother and with Hanuman, came to that same
  forest where Sugriva the monkey was.
'25': >-
  Seeing Rama arrived with Lakshmana, Sugriva—ashamed—spoke these words in a
  dejected voice, looking down at the ground:
'26': >-
  “Having told me, ‘Challenge him,’ and having shown (me) your valor, and having
  caused me to be struck down by my enemy—what is this that you have done now?”
'27': >-
  “At that very time, O Raghava, you ought to have declared the truth: ‘I shall
  not slay Vali.’ Then I would not have come out from here.”
'28': >-
  While that great-souled Sugriva thus spoke, pitifully and with humble words,
  Raghava again replied:
'29': >-
  “Sugriva, listen, dear one; let anger also be put away. I shall tell the
  reason why this arrow was not discharged by me.”
'30': >-
  “In ornaments, in dress, in stature, and in gait, you and Vali are alike to
  one another.”
'31': >-
  “By voice, by radiance, by appearance, O monkey, and also by prowess and by
  speech, I do not perceive any distinguishing mark between you two.”
'32': >-
  “Therefore, O best of monkeys, deluded by the similarity of form, I did not
  release the swift and mighty arrow that destroys the foe.”
'33': >-
  “And, fearing—because of that resemblance—that it might end life itself
  (wrongly), I considered thus: ‘Let there not be a root-striking blow upon both
  (through my error).’”
'34': >-
  “For if you, O hero, had perished through my ignorance and rashness, then my
  folly and my childishness would have been proclaimed, O lord of monkeys.”
'35': >-
  “And the great and wondrous sin called ‘the slaying of one to whom
  fearlessness has been granted’ would attach (to me). And I, and Lakshmana, and
  Sita of excellent complexion—”
'36': >-
  “—all of us are dependent on you; in this forest you are our refuge. Therefore
  fight once more; do not doubt me, O monkey.”
'37': >-
  “At this very moment, behold—(you shall see) Vali on the field of battle,
  struck down by a single arrow, cast away, writhing upon the earth.”
'38': >-
  “Make some sign for yourself, O lord of monkeys, by which I may recognize you
  when you have entered the duel.”
'39': >-
  “Plucking up this fully blossomed gaja-pushpi creeper, bearing auspicious
  marks—place it, O Lakshmana, upon the neck of this great-souled Sugriva.”
'40': >-
  Then Lakshmana, plucking up that gaja-pushpi creeper, grown upon the
  mountain-slope and laden with a multitude of blossoms, placed it upon his
  neck.
'41': >-
  Adorned with that creeper fastened at his neck, the illustrious one shone—like
  a rain-cloud at twilight, garlanded as it were with rows of cranes.
'42': >-
  Shining in body, intent upon Rama’s words, he went along with Rama and
  returned once more to Kishkindha.
'43': >-
  Thus ends the Twelfth Sarga of the Kishkindha-kanda in the holy Valmiki
  Ramayana, the Primeval Epic, entitled “The Giving of Assurance to Sugriva.”
