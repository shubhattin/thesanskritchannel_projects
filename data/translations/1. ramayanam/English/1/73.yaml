  Now begins the seventy-third sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa in the illustrious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Marriage of Daśaratha’s Sons.”
'1': >-
  On the very day on which the king performed the most excellent gift of cows,
  on that day the valiant Yudhājit arrived.
'2': >-
  He was the son of the king of Kekaya and, indeed, the maternal uncle of
  Bharata. Having seen the king, and after inquiring about his welfare, he spoke
  these words to him:
'3': >-
  “The ruler of Kekaya, out of affection, conveys his well-being. Those for
  whose welfare you are ever solicitous—at present they are free from illness.”
'4': >-
  “O lord of kings, that sovereign desires to see my sister’s son; for that
  purpose I have come to Ayodhyā, O delight of the Raghu-line.”
'5': >-
  “And hearing that, for the sake of marriage, your sons have gone to Mithilā
  along with you, O lord of the earth,”
'6': >-
  “I hastened here, wishing to see the son of my sister.” Then King Daśaratha,
  seeing that dear guest present before him,
'7': >-
  honoured him with the highest courtesies, worshipping him as one worthy of
  reverence. Then, having spent that night there together with his noble sons,
'8': >-
  at dawn, rising again and performing the rites (of the morning) as one who
  knows what is proper, he proceeded to the sacrificial enclosure, placing the
  sages in the forefront.
'9': >-
  At the auspicious moment called Vijaya, Rāma—adorned with all ornaments and
  accompanied by his brothers—appeared, having had the festive wedding rites
  (kautuka-maṅgala) performed.
'10': >-
  Placing Vasiṣṭha before them, along with the other great seers as well, the
  blessed Vasiṣṭha approached and spoke to Janaka, the king of Videha:
'11': >-
  “O king, King Daśaratha—the foremost among men—together with his sons, for
  whom the festive wedding rites have been performed, awaits the giver (of the
  bride).”
'12': >-
  “Indeed, through the giver and the receiver all purposes are fulfilled.
  Therefore, abide in your own dharma by accomplishing this excellent rite of
  marriage.”
'13': >-
  Thus addressed by the magnanimous Vasiṣṭha, that great-souled, mighty and
  supremely righteous Janaka replied with these words:
'14': >-
  “Who stands as my doorkeeper, awaiting whose command? What deliberation is
  there to be made in my own house, as though this kingdom were yours?”
'15': >-
  “All preparations and auspicious rites have been completed; (my daughters)
  have approached the foot of the altar. My daughter shines, O best of sages,
  radiant as the flame of fire.”
'16': >-
  “At once I am ready for you; I stand here at this altar. Let everything be
  done without obstacle—why, indeed, is there any delay?”
'17': >-
  Hearing the words spoken by Janaka, Daśaratha then had all his sons enter, and
  likewise the assembly of sages.
'18': >-
  Thereupon Janaka, king of the Videhas, said this to Vasiṣṭha: “O sage,
  righteous one—have the entire marriage-rite performed, together with the
  sages,”
'19': >-
  “for Rāma, the delight of the world, O lord.” Saying “So be it” to Janaka, the
  blessed sage Vasiṣṭha,
'20': >-
  placing Viśvāmitra in the forefront, and Śatānanda also, the righteous
  one—then, in the midst of the altar-ground, having duly prepared the altar,
  that great ascetic (Vasiṣṭha)...
'21': >-
  adorned that altar on every side with fragrances and flowers, with golden
  cups, and with variously ornamented jars bearing sprouts,
'22': >-
  with dishes abundant in sprouts, with vessels for incense along with incense,
  with conch-shell vessels, with ladles, with garlands, and with vessels
  consecrated for offerings such as arghya,
'23': >-
  with bowls filled with parched grain, and also with rice-grains purified and
  prepared; and, having spread even darbha-grass according to rule, with mantras
  recited in due order,
'24': >-
  he kindled the sacred fire upon the altar, in accordance with the prescribed
  rites and with mantras set in the forefront; and the mighty, radiant Vasiṣṭha,
  best among sages, offered oblations into the fire.
'25': >-
  Then, bringing Sītā, adorned with all ornaments, he placed her in the presence
  of the fire, facing toward Rāghava (Rāma).
'26': >-
  King Janaka then spoke to him who increases Kauśalyā’s joy (Rāma): “This Sītā
  is my daughter, and she shall be your companion in dharma.”
'27': >-
  “Receive her—may good befall you. Take her hand with your hand. Greatly
  fortunate and devoted to her husband, she will ever follow you like a shadow.”
'28': >-
  Having thus spoken, the king then cast (for the rite) water sanctified by
  mantras, while the gods and seers exclaimed, “Well done! Well done!”
'29': >-
  There arose a great sound of heavenly kettledrums and a shower of flowers.
  Thus, having given his daughter Sītā, with the consecrated water of mantras
  duly employed,
'30': >-
  King Janaka, overwhelmed with joy, spoke: “Lakṣmaṇa, come—may good befall you.
  I present to you Urmilā, prepared (for marriage) by me.”
'31': >-
  “Receive (her); take her hand with your hand—let there be no reversal by
  time.” Having spoken thus to him, Janaka then addressed Bharata as well:
'32': >-
  “Take the hand of Māṇḍavyā with your hand, O delight of the Raghu-line.” And
  to Śatrughna too the righteous lord of Mithilā said:
'33': >-
  “O mighty-armed one, take the hand of Śrutakīrti with your hand. All of you
  are gentle (in nature), and all are of well-conducted vows.”
'34': >-
  “Let the wives be with you, O Kakutsthas; let there be no reversal by time.”
  Hearing Janaka’s words, they touched hands with their hands.
'35': >-
  Those four, in accordance with Vasiṣṭha’s direction, stood with the four
  (brides). Having circumambulated the fire, the altar, and the king as well,
'36': >-
  and likewise the great-souled sages—those exalted scions of Raghu, together
  with their wives—then performed the marriage according to the injunctions,
  with all rites duly observed.
'37': >-
  A great shower of flowers, brilliant and auspicious, fell from the sky; and
  there were sounds of divine kettledrums, and resonances of song and
  instrumental music.
'38': >-
  Hosts of apsarases danced, and gandharvas sang melodiously. At the marriage of
  the foremost of the Raghus, that wondrous spectacle was seen.
'39': >-
  While such sounds of instruments and festal clamour prevailed, those mighty
  ones, having circumambulated the fire three times, took up their wives.
'40': >-
  Then those delights of the Raghu-line, together with their wives, went to the
  proper place for the concluding rites. The king too followed after, looking
  on, along with the hosts of sages and with his kinsmen.
'41': >-
  Thus ends the seventy-third sarga of the Bālakāṇḍa in the sacred, illustrious
  Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the primeval epic, entitled “The Marriage of Daśaratha’s
  Sons.”
