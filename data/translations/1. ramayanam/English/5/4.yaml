  Now begins the fourth sarga of Sundara Kāṇḍa in the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Entry into the City of Laṅkā.”
'1': >-
  Having subdued that excellent city of Laṅkā—endowed with the power to assume
  forms at will—Hanumān, the most eminent of monkeys, endowed with great
  splendor, accomplished it by his own prowess.
'2': >-
  By a passage where there was no gate, that mighty and valiant one vaulted over
  the rampart; and in the night the great-souled, elephant-like chief among
  monkeys entered Laṅkā.
'3': >-
  Entering the city of Laṅkā, that benefactor of the king of monkeys then set
  his left foot down, as though upon the very heads of his enemies.
'4': >-
  Having thus entered by night, the son of the Wind-god—rich in courage and
  strength—kept to the great roadway, which was radiant with strewn and loosened
  blossoms.
'5': >-
  Then the monkey proceeded through that delightful city of Laṅkā, preceded on
  every side by the sounds of musical instruments and by laughter and exultant
  cries.
'6': >-
  Adorned with houses resembling thunderbolts and goads, and embellished with
  net-like ornaments as of adamant, that charming city with its mansion-clouds
  shone forth like the heaven adorned with masses of clouds.
'7': >-
  Then Laṅkā blazed forth splendidly with the fair dwellings of the rākṣasa
  hosts—white like autumn-clouds, variegated, and arranged with lotus and
  svastika designs.
'8': >-
  Everywhere it was richly adorned with ever-rising mansions; thus that
  city—decked with wondrous garlands and ornaments—was beheld by that benefactor
  of the lord of monkeys, and he rejoiced.
'9': >-
  That illustrious one, ranging about for the sake of Rāghava, went from house
  to house; the elephant-like monkey beheld (the sights of Laṅkā) again and
  again, and was filled with wonder and delight.
'10': >-
  There and there he saw mansions of many kinds of shapes and forms; and he
  heard delightful singing, embellished with the three registers of musical
  sound.
'11': >-
  He heard the jingling of women’s girdles and the sweet resonance of
  anklets—women pierced by the arrows of Kāma, like celestial apsarās moving in
  the sky.
'12': >-
  He also heard the sounds of stairways within the great ones’ houses, and, from
  place to place, the sounds of clapping, snapping, and loud exultant cries.
'13': >-
  There, within the homes of the rākṣasas, he heard the recitation of mantras;
  and he saw the yātudhānas intent upon svādhyāya (self-study and sacred
  recitation).
'14': >-
  He also beheld rākṣasas roaring, accompanied by praises of Rāvaṇa, and a great
  host of rākṣasas stationed, covering the royal road.
'15': >-
  In the midst of that formation he saw many rākṣasa scouts—some consecrated,
  some matted-haired, some shaven-headed—clad in garments of cowhide.
'16': >-
  He saw some wielding bundles of darbha grass as weapons, some bearing
  fire-pits as their arms, some with spiked clubs in their hands, and others
  holding staves as weapons.
'17': >-
  He saw some one-eyed, some of many colors; some with pendulous bellies and
  heavy hanging breasts; some grim and hideous, some with distorted faces; some
  monstrous, and some dwarfish as well.
'18': >-
  He saw archers and swordsmen too; those armed with śataghnīs and maces; others
  bearing excellent iron bars; and many shining in wondrous coats of mail.
'19': >-
  He saw them neither overly corpulent nor overly emaciated; neither too tall
  nor too short; neither too fair nor too dark; neither too hunchbacked nor too
  dwarfish.
'20': >-
  He saw misshapen ones, many-formed ones, and also well-formed ones of radiant
  appearance; some bearing standards and pennons as well; and they carried
  weapons of many kinds.
'21': >-
  He saw, too, those bearing spears and trees as weapons; those holding axes and
  swords; and those with throwing-engines and nooses in their hands—thus that
  great monkey beheld them.
'22': >-
  He saw many wearing garlands, anointed with unguents, adorned with excellent
  ornaments, equipped with various disguises and costumes, moving about as they
  pleased.
'23': >-
  He saw also those bearing sharp tridents, and mighty ones like wielders of the
  thunderbolt; and there was a central guard, unwearied and vigilant, numbering
  a hundred thousand.
'24': >-
  He beheld, in front of the inner apartments, the station assigned by the lord
  of the rākṣasas; and then, seeing that house with its great gateway of gold,
'25': >-
  (He saw) the famed abode of the lord of rākṣasas, established upon a mountain
  summit, encircled by moats adorned like garlands of white lotuses.
'26': >-
  Enclosed on all sides by exceedingly massive ramparts, that great monkey
  beheld it—celestial like the heaven of the Thirty-three, and resounding with
  divine sounds.
'27': >-
  It was filled with the neighing of horses, and also made resonant by
  ornaments; and it thronged with chariots, conveyances, aerial cars, as well as
  with auspicious horses and elephants.
'28': >-
  It was adorned with four-tusked elephants, like heaps of white clouds; its
  gates were lovely and decorated; and there were also intoxicated beasts and
  birds (kept within),
'29': >-
  And it was guarded by thousands upon thousands of exceedingly valorous
  yātudhānas. Then the monkey entered that well-protected mansion of the lord of
  rākṣasas.
'30': >-
  Thus he entered Rāvaṇa’s inner palace—encircled by a golden wall of Jāmbūnada
  gold, its interior adorned with priceless pearls and gems, and made worthy of
  precious black aloes and sandalwood of the finest kind.
'31': >-
  Thus ends the fourth sarga of Sundara Kāṇḍa in the ancient, venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa—the Ādi-kāvya—entitled “The Entry into the City of Laṅkā.”
