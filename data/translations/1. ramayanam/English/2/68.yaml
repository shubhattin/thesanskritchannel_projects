  Now begins the sixty-eighth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, named “The Dispatching of the Messengers.”
'1': >-
  Hearing their words, Vasiṣṭha replied to all those ministers, friends, and
  companies of counsellors, and to the brāhmaṇas as well, with these words.
'2': >-
  “Bharata—together with his brother Śatrughna—dwells happily in the city of
  Rājagṛha, in the house of his maternal uncle’s family.
'3': >-
  “Let swift messengers go quickly, mounted on speedy horses, to bring back
  those two heroic brothers. Why should we delay and deliberate?”
'4': >-
  Then all of them said to Vasiṣṭha, “Let them go.” Hearing what they said,
  Vasiṣṭha spoke again.
'5': >-
  “Come—Siddhārtha, Vijaya, Jayanta, Aśoka, and Nandana—listen. I shall tell you
  all, in full, what must be done.”
'6': >-
  “Go to the city of Rājagṛha with all speed, on horses of great swiftness.
  Having cast away grief, this is what Bharata must be told, by my command:
'7': >-
  ‘The royal priest declares that you are well; and all the ministers too speak
  of your welfare. Make haste and set out at once; there is urgent business that
  must be done by you.’”
'8': >-
  “Do not, upon going, disclose to him that Rāma is absent; do not disclose to
  him that his father is dead. Do not report to him this ruin that has befallen
  the Rāghavas.”
'9': >-
  “Quickly take silken garments, and excellent ornaments as well—both for the
  king and for Bharata—and depart.”
'10': >-
  The messengers, having been given wholesome provisions for the journey, went
  each to his own lodging; and, intending to go to the Kekayas, they mounted
  horses approved for their worth.
'11': >-
  Then, after making the preparations for departure and completing what remained
  to be done, the messengers—having received Vasiṣṭha’s permission—set out in
  haste.
'12': >-
  Avoiding the region of the western Tālas, and keeping to the northern
  direction, they went along, passing through the midst of the river Mālinī.
'13': >-
  Crossing the Gaṅgā at Hastināpura, they proceeded facing westward; and,
  reaching the land of the Pāñcālas, they went through the middle of
  Kuru-jāṅgala.
'14': >-
  They went swiftly on account of their task, looking upon lakes filled to the
  brim and rivers of clear water.
'15': >-
  With speed they approached the divine river Śaradandā, whose waters were
  limpid and pleasing, frequented by many kinds of birds, and thronged with
  people.
'16': >-
  Reaching a riverside tree, famed as a sacred place where true requests are
  fulfilled, they approached it and paid reverence; and then they entered the
  city of Kuliṅga.
'17': >-
  Then, at the proper time, they reached the holy Ikṣumatī river, famed from
  ancient tradition, flowing down from the region of Bodhi-bhavana, and they
  crossed it.
'18': >-
  Seeing brāhmaṇas who had cups formed by their joined palms, and who were
  masters of the Vedas, they proceeded through the midst of the Bāhlīkas, and
  came to Mount Sudāman.
'19': >-
  Beholding Viṣṇu’s Footprint, and also the rivers Vipāśā and Śālmālī, and
  seeing wells, tanks, pools, marshes, and lakes as well,
'20': >-
  and observing various lions, tigers, deer, and elephants, they travelled by
  that very great highway, intent on accomplishing their lord’s command.
'21': >-
  Those messengers—whose mounts were weary—having journeyed by a long and
  arduous road, reached swiftly and directly the excellent city called
  Girivraja.
'22': >-
  For the sake of what was dear to their lord, for the protection of the royal
  lineage, and for the safeguarding of their master’s dynasty, the messengers
  hastened without causing offence; and indeed they reached that very city
  during the night.
'23': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-eighth sarga of the Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa in the sacred,
  illustrious Rāmāyaṇa composed by Vālmīki, the Ādi-kāvya, entitled “The
  Dispatching of the Messengers.”
