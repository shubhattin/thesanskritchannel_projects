  Now begins the Fiftieth Sarga, named “Meeting with Guha,” in the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa
  of the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. (2-50)
'1': >-
  Having passed through the vast and delightful land of Kosala, the wise elder
  brother of Lakṣmaṇa, facing toward Ayodhyā, spoke with joined palms. (2-50-1)
'2': >-
  I take leave of you, O best of cities, protected by the descendants of
  Kakutstha; and of those deities also who guard you and dwell within you.
  (2-50-2)
'3': >-
  When my residence in the forest has come to an end, I—free of debt to the Lord
  of the earth—shall behold you again, reunited with my mother and my father.
  (2-50-3)
'4': >-
  Then, the lotus-eyed one, whose eyes were reddened like blood, raising his
  right arm, his face filled with tears and stricken with grief, spoke to the
  people of the countryside. (2-50-4)
'5': >-
  Compassion and mercy, as was fitting, have indeed been shown toward me by you.
  Let this most grievous of long sorrows be gone, so that the purpose may be
  accomplished. (2-50-5)
'6': >-
  Having saluted that great-souled one and having also circumambulated him, the
  men, lamenting terribly, stood scattered here and there. (2-50-6)
'7': >-
  While those people thus lamented, still unsated with the sight of him, Rāghava
  passed out of their view, like the sun at the face of night. (2-50-7)
'8': >-
  Then the tiger among men went beyond the land of Kosala—rich in grain and
  wealth, filled with auspicious folk devoted to giving, fearless on every side,
  and adorned with sacred shrines and sacrificial posts. (2-50-8)
'9': >-
  It was furnished with gardens and mango groves, possessed of plentiful
  reservoirs of water, crowded with contented and well-nourished people, and
  frequented by many herds and cow-pens. (2-50-9)
'10': >-
  Full of towns and villages worthy to be marked and remembered, resounding with
  the chanting of the Veda—through such Kosala the tiger among men went on in
  his chariot. (2-50-10)
'11': >-
  Through the middle of that prosperous and joyful realm—pleasant and filled
  with lovely gardens—the best of the steadfast proceeded on, a kingdom fit to
  be enjoyed by kings. (2-50-11)
'12': >-
  There Rāghava beheld the divine Gaṅgā, the holy threefold-flowing river,
  bearing auspicious waters, free from algae, and frequented by sages. (2-50-12)
'13': >-
  She was graced by splendid hermitages not far off, and at the proper seasons
  was attended by delighted apsarās; she was auspicious, with lotus-ponds.
  (2-50-13)
'14': >-
  She was adorned by gods, dānavas, gandharvas, and kinnaras, and constantly
  attended by nāga maidens and the wives of gandharvas—ever auspicious.
  (2-50-14)
'15': >-
  Filled with hundreds of divine playgrounds and tens of thousands of celestial
  gardens, famed as the divine river-lotus, moving through the sky for the sake
  of the gods. (2-50-15)
'16': >-
  With the mighty laughter of her splashing waters, with foam as her stainless
  smile; in places her waters were gathered into braided streams, and in places
  she was beautified by whirlpools. (2-50-16)
'17': >-
  In some places she was still and deep; in some places turbulent with swift
  waters; in some places with deep roaring sounds; in some places with dreadful,
  fearsome noise. (2-50-17)
'18': >-
  Her waters were thronged with hosts of gods, and she shone with spotless blue
  lotuses; in some places she had broad sandbanks, and in some places she was of
  pure, clean sand. (2-50-18)
'19': >-
  Resounding with flocks of swans, and echoed by the calls of cakravāka birds;
  ever reverberating with the cries of intoxicated birds. (2-50-19)
'20': >-
  In some places she was adorned by trees growing on her banks, like garlands;
  in some places covered with blossoming water-lilies, and in some places
  crowded with forests of lotuses. (2-50-20)
'21': >-
  In some places beautified with clusters of white lotuses and their buds; and
  in some places, dusted with the pollen of many flowers, as though she herself
  were joyously intoxicated. (2-50-21)
'22': >-
  With masses of impurity gone, her sight clear like a spotless gem; and along
  her, celestial elephants, forest elephants, and rut-maddened excellent tuskers
  were present. (2-50-22)
'23': >-
  Again and again she made the inner forests resound with the cries of elephants
  fit to bear the gods; and she seemed like a young woman carefully adorned with
  the finest ornaments. (2-50-23)
'24': >-
  Abounding in fruits, flowers, and tender shoots, and in thickets and birds;
  and also inhabited by śiṃśumāras, crocodiles, and serpents. (2-50-24)
'25': >-
  The divine Gaṅgā, fallen from Viṣṇu’s foot—sinless, and the destroyer of
  sin—fallen from Śaṅkara’s matted locks, and shining with the splendor of the
  ocean. (2-50-25)
'26': >-
  That Gaṅgā, the queen of the sea, resounding with the cries of cranes and
  krauñca birds—upon her the mighty-armed one came, as he made for
  Śṛṅgibera-pura. (2-50-26)
'27': >-
  Beholding the river, confused with waves and whirlpools, the great charioteer
  spoke to Sumantra, the charioteer: “Here indeed shall we stay today.”
  (2-50-27)
'28': >-
  Not far from this river stands a very great ingudī tree, laden with many
  flowers and fresh shoots. Here we shall dwell, O charioteer. (2-50-28)
'29': >-
  We shall behold the best of rivers, whose waters are worthy of reverence,
  auspicious—(a river) visited by gods, dānavas, gandharvas, beasts, men, and
  birds.” (2-50-29)
'30': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa and Sumantra, saying “So be it,” to Rāghava, then approached that
  ingudī tree with the horses. (2-50-30)
'31': >-
  Rāma, the delight of the Ikṣvāku race, having gone up to that lovely tree,
  descended from the chariot along with his wife, together with Lakṣmaṇa.
  (2-50-31)
'32': >-
  Sumantra too alighted, and having unharnessed the excellent horses, stood near
  Rāma who had gone to the foot of the tree, with palms joined in reverence.
  (2-50-32)
'33': >-
  There was a king named Guha, Rāma’s friend, equal to him in affection—of the
  Niṣāda tribe, powerful, and renowned as a chieftain. (2-50-33)
'34': >-
  Hearing that Rāma, the tiger among men, had come into his territory, he
  approached, surrounded by aged ministers and also by kinsmen. (2-50-34)
'35': >-
  Then, seeing from afar the lord of the Niṣādas standing there, Rāma, along
  with Saumitrī, went and met Guha. (2-50-35)
'36': >-
  Afflicted with emotion, Guha embraced Rāghava and said: “As is Ayodhyā, so is
  this place for you, O Rāma. What shall I do for you?” (2-50-36)
'37': >-
  For who, O mighty-armed one, could obtain such a beloved guest as you in such
  a manner? Then, bringing various kinds of excellent food, he quickly offered
  arghya (water for honoring a guest) and spoke these words. (2-50-37)
'38': >-
  Welcome to you, O mighty-armed one! This entire earth is yours. We are your
  servants; you are our lord. Govern our kingdom well. (2-50-38)
'39': >-
  Here are foods to be eaten, foods to be enjoyed, drinks, and things to be
  licked; and excellent beds, and fodder as well for your horses. (2-50-39)
'40': As Guha spoke thus, Rāghava replied to him. (2-50-40)
'41': >-
  In every way we have been honored and gladdened by you—by your coming on foot
  to meet us, and by the sight of your affection. (2-50-41)
'42': >-
  Pressing him firmly with his well-conducted arms, he spoke this word: “By good
  fortune I see you, O Guha, healthy, together with your kinsmen.” (2-50-42)
'43': >-
  Is all well with you—in your realm, among your friends, and in your wealth?
  But as for whatever you have prepared with love, I permit it all; for I do not
  accept gifts. (2-50-43)
'44': >-
  Know me as one clad in kuśa-grass and bark-garments, wearing a deer-skin,
  eating fruits and roots—one devoted to dharma, an ascetic, dwelling in the
  forest. (2-50-44)
'45': >-
  I desire nothing else, save fodder for the horses. By this much alone, I shall
  be well honored here by you. (2-50-45)
'46': >-
  For these horses are dear to me, belonging to my father, King Daśaratha; by
  these well-cared-for horses I shall feel honored. (2-50-46)
'47': >-
  He directed that the horses be given water to drink and be fed. Then Guha, on
  the spot, instructed his men: “Let it be done quickly.” (2-50-47)
'48': >-
  Then, wearing bark-garments and an upper cloth, having sat for the western
  twilight worship, he took only water as his food—brought by Lakṣmaṇa himself.
  (2-50-48)
'49': >-
  As he lay upon the ground, Lakṣmaṇa washed the feet of Rāma together with his
  wife; then, drawing near, he stood leaning against a tree. (2-50-49)
'50': >-
  Guha also, together with the charioteer, speaking with Saumitrī, thereafter
  kept watch over Rāma—unwearied, bow in hand. (2-50-50)
'51': >-
  Thus, while that wise, illustrious, great-souled son of Daśaratha—one who had
  never before seen sorrow and was worthy of happiness—lay resting, that night
  passed for him, though it seemed long. (2-50-51)
'52': >-
  Thus ends the Fiftieth Sarga, named “Meeting with Guha,” in the Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa
  of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādi-kāvya. (2-50)
