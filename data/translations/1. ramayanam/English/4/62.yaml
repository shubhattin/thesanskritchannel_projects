  Now, in the sacred Valmiki-Ramayana, in the Kishkindha-kanda, begins the
  sixty-second canto, called “The Prophecy concerning Nishakara (Sampati).”
'1': >-
  Having spoken thus to the foremost of sages, Aruna—overwhelmed with intense
  sorrow—then meditated for a moment; and thereafter the Blessed one spoke these
  words.
'2': >-
  “Both your wings and your lesser pinions shall again come into being; your two
  eyes, your very life-breaths, your prowess, and your strength too shall return
  to you.
'3': >-
  “A very great deed, spoken of in ancient lore, shall come to pass. By
  austerity I have also beheld it; and having heard of it, it is known to me as
  well.
'4': >-
  “There shall be a king named Dasharatha, an enhancer of the Ikshvaku line; and
  to him shall be born a son of great splendor, named Rama.
'5': >-
  “He shall go to the forest together with his brother Lakshmana—being appointed
  to that purpose by his father, Rama of true valor, steadfast in truth.
'6': >-
  “A Rakshasa named Ravana, a ranger of the night, shall seize away his wife;
  that lord of Rakshasas in Janasthana shall be invincible even to the gods and
  the Danavas.
'7': >-
  “And that illustrious Maithili—though enticed by desires, by foods to be eaten
  and delicacies to be enjoyed—shall not partake of them; the highly fortunate
  lady, plunged in sorrow, shall endure.
'8': >-
  “Knowing Vaidehi’s condition, Vasava (Indra) shall give her the choicest
  food—food resembling ambrosia, hard to obtain even for the gods.
'9': >-
  “Maithili, obtaining that food and recognizing, ‘This is from Indra,’ shall
  take up the foremost portion and place it as an offering upon the ground for
  Rama.
'10': >-
  “Thinking, ‘If my husband yet lives—or Lakshmana, my husband’s younger
  brother; or if the two have gone to godhood—this food is for them,’ she shall
  do so.
'11': >-
  “There, monkeys—messengers sent by Rama—shall arrive. O bird, by you the queen
  of Rama is to be made known to them.
'12': >-
  “But by no means should you go forth now—where would you, in such a condition,
  go? Await the proper place and time; you shall regain your wings.
'13': >-
  “I am able even today to make you winged at once; but remaining here, you
  shall accomplish a work beneficial to the worlds.
'14': >-
  “And indeed, by you that work is to be done—for those two princes, and for
  Brahmanas, for preceptors, for sages, and for Vasava (Indra) as well.
'15': >-
  “I too desire to behold the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana; nor do I wish to
  sustain my life long— I shall abandon this body.” Thus spoke the great sage, a
  seer who had realized the truth and beheld the meaning of things.
'16': >-
  Thus ends the sixty-second canto, named “The Prophecy concerning Nishakara,”
  in the Kishkindha-kanda of the sacred Valmiki-Ramayana, the Adi-kavya.
