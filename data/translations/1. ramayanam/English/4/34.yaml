  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa, the
  thirty-fourth chapter, called “The Rebuke of Sugrīva.”
'1': >-
  Seeing Lakṣmaṇa—the bull among men—enter, unimpeded and wrathful, Sugrīva
  became distressed in all his senses.
'2': >-
  When he beheld that son of Daśaratha, inflamed with anger, breathing hard, as
  though blazing with his own splendour, and scorched with grief on account of
  his brother’s calamity,
'3': >-
  the foremost of monkeys sprang up at once, abandoning his golden seat—like a
  lofty banner of the great Indra, as it were, richly adorned.
'4': >-
  As Sugrīva leapt up, the women beginning with Rumā rose up after him, like
  clusters of stars following the full moon in the sky.
'5': >-
  That illustrious one, with eyes reddened, moved forward with joined palms, and
  stood there—like a great wish-fulfilling tree.
'6': >-
  Lakṣmaṇa, wrathful, addressed Sugrīva who stood amidst women with Rumā as the
  second (at his side), like the moon amid stars with Tārā (as his consort).
'7': >-
  A king who is endowed with strength and noble birth, compassionate,
  self-controlled, grateful, and a speaker of truth—he is honoured in the world.
'8': >-
  But the king who stands established in unrighteousness, who, toward helpful
  friends, makes a false promise—who is more cruel than he?
'9': >-
  By falsehood concerning a hundred horses one destroys (the merit of) a
  hundred; by falsehood concerning a thousand cows, (one destroys) a thousand;
  but by falsehood toward a man, a man destroys his very self and his own
  kinsmen.
'10': >-
  He who, having first been benefited by his friends, does not render return for
  that—such a grateful-less one is a slayer of all beings; he deserves to be
  slain, O lord of monkeys.
'11': >-
  This verse, sung by Brahmā and revered by all the worlds, is well known:
  having seen the ungrateful, the enraged (Brahmā spoke thus). Understand this,
  O monkey.
'12': >-
  For one who slays a cow, for one who drinks spirituous liquor, for a thief,
  and likewise for one who breaks his vows—atonement has been prescribed by the
  righteous; but for the ungrateful there is no atonement.
'13': >-
  You are ignoble, ungrateful, and a speaker of falsehood, O monkey—since,
  though you were first benefited by Rāma, you do not repay that deed.
'14': >-
  Surely, O monkey, having been thus benefited by Rāma, if you desire to do what
  is right, you ought to make effort in the search for Sītā.
'15': >-
  But you—attached to vulgar pleasures, and false to your promise—Rāma does not
  recognize you (for what you are), like a serpent that devours frogs.
'16': >-
  By noble Rāma—though he is compassionate and sensitive to suffering—a sinful
  wretch like you was brought to kingship over the monkeys; you, of wicked soul,
  were raised up by that great-souled one.
'17': >-
  If you do not properly acknowledge what has been done by the great-souled
  Rāghava, then at once you shall see Vālin struck down by sharp arrows.
'18': >-
  That path is not closed or contracted by which Vālin went, slain. Stand within
  the appointed time, Sugrīva—do not follow the path of Vālin (to death).
'19': >-
  Surely you do not see those arrows, like thunderbolts, coming from the bow of
  the prince of the Ikṣvāku line; therefore you dwell at ease, as one happy, and
  do not even in your mind attend to Rāma’s task.
'20': >-
  Thus ends the thirty-fourth chapter of the Kiṣkindhā-kāṇḍa in the holy Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the great epic, entitled “The Rebuke of Sugrīva.”
