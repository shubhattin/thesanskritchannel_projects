  Now, in the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, is the eighty-seventh
  canto, named “The Mutual Reproach of Vibhīṣaṇa and the Son of Rāvaṇa.”
'1': >-
  Having spoken thus to Saumitrī (Lakṣmaṇa), Vibhīṣaṇa—his heart gladdened—took
  him, bow in hand, and hurried away.
'2': >-
  Then, having gone not far, and entering a great forest, Vibhīṣaṇa showed
  Lakṣmaṇa that stratagem (that deed to be done).
'3': >-
  To Lakṣmaṇa, the radiant brother of Rāvaṇa pointed out a dreadful nyagrodha
  (banyan) tree, dark as a mass of blue rain-clouds and of fearsome aspect.
'4': >-
  “Here, the mighty son of Rāvaṇa makes an offering to the spirits; and
  afterwards, having made that offering, he returns to the battle.”
'5': >-
  “Thereupon that rākṣasa becomes invisible to all beings, and in the fight he
  slays his enemies and binds them with his excellent arrows.”
'6': >-
  “That powerful son of Rāvaṇa, once he has entered this nyagrodha—strike him
  down with blazing shafts, together with his chariot, his horses, and his
  charioteer.”
'7': >-
  “So be it,” said Saumitrī, the friend-delighting, the greatly radiant one; and
  he stood there, fittingly poised, wondrously drawing his bow to its full
  stretch.
'8': >-
  Then, upon a chariot of fire-like hue, the mighty son of
  Rāvaṇa—Indrajit—appeared, armored, sword in hand, and bearing a banner.
'9': >-
  To that unconquered scion of Pulastya, the greatly radiant Lakṣmaṇa spoke: “I
  challenge you in battle; grant me now a true and proper combat.”
'10': >-
  Thus addressed, the greatly radiant and high-souled son of Rāvaṇa, seeing
  Vibhīṣaṇa there, spoke harsh words.
'11': >-
  “Here you were born and brought up—indeed you are my father’s own brother. How
  do you betray your nephew, O rākṣasa—my paternal uncle—by turning against your
  brother’s son?”
'12': >-
  “In you, O evil-minded one, there is no sense of kinship, no friendliness, no
  regard for family; there is no measure (of propriety), no brotherly affection,
  and no dharma—you who defile dharma!”
'13': >-
  “You are one to be pitied, O misguided one, and to be censured by the
  righteous—because you have abandoned your own people and come to live as
  another’s servant.”
'14': >-
  “With such a feeble understanding you do not grasp the great difference: where
  is dwelling among one’s own, and where is, O base one, dependence upon
  others?”
'15': >-
  “Even if outsiders be virtuous and one’s own be without virtue, still one’s
  own—though lacking in merit—is preferable; the other is other indeed.”
'16': >-
  “He who abandons his own side and attaches himself to the enemy’s side—when
  his own party has perished, is afterwards slain by those very people (whom he
  served).”
'17': >-
  “Such is this mercilessness in you, O night-roamer; only against your own kin
  could you display this ‘valor,’ O younger brother of Rāvaṇa!”
'18': >-
  Thus spoken to by his brother’s son, Vibhīṣaṇa replied: “As though you do not
  know my nature—why do you boast so, O rākṣasa?”
'19': >-
  “O base son of the lord of rākṣasas, abandon this harshness out of regard for
  honor. Though I am born in a lineage of rākṣasas of cruel deeds, the foremost
  quality among men—this is my conduct—namely, what is not rākṣasa-like.”
'20': >-
  “I do not delight in cruelty, nor do I delight in adharma. Even if a brother
  be of perverse disposition, how can he be rejected merely because he is a
  brother?”
'21': >-
  “Abandoning a man who has fallen away from dharma and is fixed in sinful
  resolve, one attains happiness—just as one casts away a venomous serpent from
  the hand.”
'22': >-
  “A wicked man, devoted to stealing others’ wealth and to violating others’
  wives, is declared fit to be abandoned—like a house that has caught fire.”
'23': >-
  “The taking of others’ property, the violation of others’ wives, and excessive
  suspicion of friends—these three faults bring ruin.”
'24': >-
  “The dreadful slaughter of great seers; hostility even with all the gods; and
  further—arrogance and wrath, enmity and opposition—”
'25': >-
  “These faults of my brother are destroyers of life and sovereignty; they
  covered up his virtues, as rain-clouds cover mountains.”
'26': >-
  “Because of these faults, I have renounced my brother—your father. Lanka is
  not to be regarded as ‘mine’; nor are you, nor is your father (any longer
  mine).”
'27': >-
  “Over-proud, and childish, and ill-disciplined, O rākṣasa—you are bound by the
  noose of Time. Say to me whatever you wish.”
'28': >-
  “Today I have met with this misfortune—that you have spoken harshly to me. You
  are not able to enter this nyagrodha, O vilest of rākṣasas.”
'29': >-
  “And having affronted the Kakutstha prince, you cannot continue to live.
  Fight, here in battle, with Lakṣmaṇa, the lord among men. When slain, you will
  accomplish the work of the gods, and go to Yama’s abode.”
'30': >-
  “Display your own raised-up strength; expend all your weapons and arrows. For
  once you come within the range of Lakṣmaṇa’s shafts, you will not depart today
  alive—though you still have your forces with you.”
'31': >-
  Thus ends the eighty-seventh canto of the Yuddha-kāṇḍa in the revered Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya, entitled “The Mutual Reproach of Vibhīṣaṇa and the Son
  of Rāvaṇa.”
