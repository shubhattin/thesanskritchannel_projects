  Now, in the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Uttarakāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-eighth canto, called “The Curse of Yayāti.”
'1': >-
  While Rāma was thus speaking, Lakṣmaṇa—the slayer of hostile heroes—answered
  that high-souled one, who blazed as it were with splendour.
'2': >-
  “A great, wondrous marvel, ancient in the line of Videha, took place, O tiger
  among kings, together with (in connection with) Nimi and Vasiṣṭha.
'3': >-
  Nimi indeed was a valiant kṣatriya, and in particular one duly consecrated
  (initiated for sacrifice); yet that king did not practise forbearance toward
  the great-souled Vasiṣṭha.
'4': >-
  Thus addressed by him, that illustrious bull among kṣatriyas—versed in all the
  śāstras—spoke these words to Lakṣmaṇa:
'5': >-
  “Rāma, the foremost among those who delight (the world), delights his brother
  of radiant energy; yet, O hero, forbearance is not seen everywhere among men.
'6': >-
  O Saumitri, unbearable is the wrath which Yayāti, setting dharma (true virtue)
  before him and following the path of noble conduct, endured. Hear of that with
  a composed mind.
'7': >-
  There was King Yayāti, son of Nahuṣa, increaser of the Puru line. He had two
  wives, O gentle one, unrivalled in beauty upon the earth.
'8': >-
  One of them, honoured above the rest by that royal seer, was Śarmiṣṭhā by
  name, a Daiteyī, the daughter of Vṛṣaparvan.
'9': >-
  The other was Devayānī, the wife of Uśanas (Śukra), O bull among men, but she
  was not dear to King Yayāti.
'10': >-
  From those two were born two sons, handsome and steadfast: Śarmiṣṭhā bore
  Pūru, and at that time Devayānī bore Yadu.
'11': >-
  But Pūru was dear to the king, by his virtues and also by reason of his
  mother’s place (in the king’s affection). Then Yadu, overwhelmed with sorrow,
  spoke to his mother:
'12': >-
  “Born in the lineage of Bhṛgu, of the divine one whose deeds are untroubled
  (faultless), I endure this grief lodged in my heart, and this insult that is
  hard to bear.
'13': >-
  Come, O goddess-like lady, let us together enter the fire; while the king
  sports for many nights in the company of the daughter of a Daitya.”
'14': >-
  “Or, if this is bearable to you, you should permit me (to depart as I choose).
  You may forgive; I shall not forgive. I shall die—of this there is no doubt.”
'15': >-
  Hearing the words of her son—uttered in supreme distress while he
  wept—Devayānī, enraged, then remembered her father.
'16': >-
  Understanding that sign (her unspoken thought), the Bhārgava came there in
  haste, to the very place where Devayānī was.
'17': >-
  And seeing her not in her natural state—joyless and senseless—her father said
  to his daughter, “What is this?”
'18': >-
  Questioned repeatedly by the Bhārgava of blazing splendour, Devayānī, angered,
  spoke these words to her father:
'19': >-
  “I shall consume fire, or sharp poison, or enter into the waters, O best of
  sages; I shall not be able to live (thus).”
'20': >-
  “You do not understand me—grief-stricken and insulted. By disdain of a tree, O
  brāhmaṇa, those who live upon the tree are cut down (destroyed).”
'21': >-
  “And by disdain, O Bhārgava—after humiliating a royal seer—he directs contempt
  toward me and does not regard me much at all.”
'22': >-
  Hearing her speech, the Bhārgava, flooded with anger, began to pronounce a
  curse upon the son of Nahuṣa.
'23': >-
  “Since you disdain me, O Nahuṣa, you wicked-souled one, worn away by grievous
  old age, you shall come to frailty and looseness of body.”
'24': >-
  Having thus spoken, and having consoled his daughter, the great-glorious
  brahmarṣi (Bhārgava) returned again to his own abode.
'25': >-
  Thus the foremost among brāhmaṇas, after consoling his daughter Devayānī, went
  back—his radiance like the sun—having bestowed a curse upon the son of Nahuṣa.
'26': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-eighth canto, called “The Curse of Yayāti,” in the
  Uttarakāṇḍa of the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the Primeval Epic.
