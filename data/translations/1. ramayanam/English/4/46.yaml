  Now, in the sacred Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, begins the
  forty-sixth chapter, entitled “The Account of the Roaming over the Circle of
  the Earth.”
'1': >-
  When the lords of the monkeys had departed, Rāma said to Sugrīva: “How is it
  that you know, in truth, the entire circle of the earth?”
'2': >-
  Then Sugrīva, of humble spirit and with reverent mind, replied to Rāma: “Let
  my words be heard; I shall relate everything to you in full detail.”
'3': >-
  “When Vālī pursued a dānava named Dundubhi—who had assumed the form of a
  buffalo—towards the Malaya mountain,”
'4': >-
  “then that buffalo entered a cave of Malaya; and Vālī too entered there,
  intent on slaying him.”
'5': >-
  “Then I was set down at the mouth of the cave, as if in attendance; yet Vālī
  did not come out, even when a full year had passed.”
'6': >-
  “Thereafter, with a rush of blood, the cavern was filled; seeing that, I was
  struck with wonder and was tormented by sorrow for my brother.”
'7': >-
  “And then, my reason having failed me, I clearly concluded: ‘My elder brother
  has been slain.’ I placed a rock like a mountain at the cave’s entrance.”
'8': >-
  “Unable to come out, that buffalo perished within. Then, despairing of Vālī’s
  life, I went back to Kiṣkindhā.”
'9': >-
  “Having obtained the vast kingdom, and Tārā along with Rumā, and being there
  together with my friends, I dwelt in that place, my agitation gone.”
'10': >-
  “Then Vālī, the bull among monkeys, came back after killing him. Out of
  respect, yet constrained by fear, I surrendered the kingdom to him.”
'11': >-
  “But Vālī, evil-souled and with senses disturbed, intent on killing me, began
  to pursue me as I fled together with my ministers.”
'12': >-
  “Then, followed by that Vālī, I ran on, beholding diverse rivers, forests, and
  cities,”
'13': >-
  “and the earth appeared to me like the surface of a mirror—like a whirling
  firebrand’s circle—made as small as a cow’s hoof-print.”
'14': >-
  “Going then to the eastern quarter, I saw various trees, delightful mountains
  with their caves and glens, and many kinds of lakes,”
'15': >-
  “and there I beheld the mountain of the Rising (the East), adorned with
  minerals; and the Ocean of Milk as well, ever the abode of the Apsarases.”
'16': >-
  “Thus pursued at that time by Vālī and driven on, I turned back again all at
  once and set forth then, O mighty one.”
'17': >-
  “From that region I proceeded further to the southern quarter, thick with the
  trees of the Vindhya and beautified by sandalwood trees,”
'18': >-
  “and, seeing the spaces between trees and mountains, I went still farther
  south, and reached the western quarter—pursued closely by Vālī.”
'19': >-
  “While looking upon diverse lands and that supreme mountain of Sunset, having
  reached that best of mountains, I ran northward.”
'20': >-
  “When, pursued by Vālī, I found no refuge, I beheld Himavān and Meru, and the
  northern sea as well.”
'21': >-
  “Then wise Hanumān said to me: ‘O king, now I remember how Vālī, the lord of
  monkeys…’”
'22': >-
  “‘…was once cursed by Mataṅga in this precinct of the hermitage: “If indeed
  Vālī should enter here, his head would split into a hundred pieces.”’”
'23': >-
  “‘There our dwelling will be comfortable and free from fear. Therefore, O
  prince, let us approach the mountain Ṛṣyamūka.’”
'24': >-
  “Then Vālī did not enter there, out of fear of Mataṅga. Thus, O king, I
  perceived directly in that time the entire circle of the earth; and thereafter
  I came to the cave.”
'25': >-
  Thus ends the forty-sixth chapter, entitled “The Account of the Roaming over
  the Circle of the Earth,” in the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa of the holy Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  the primeval epic.
