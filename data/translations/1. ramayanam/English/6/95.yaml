  Now, in the glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, within the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  ninety-fifth sarga, entitled “The Lamentation of the Rākṣasī-women.”
'1': >-
  Those thousands upon thousands of elephants, together with their riders, and
  those horses; and the chariots, flaming like fire, bearing their
  standards—numberless in their multitude—
'2': >-
  and thousands of Rākṣasas, warriors fighting with clubs and iron maces; heroes
  of wondrous forms at will, their golden banners variegated and bright—
'3': >-
  all were slain by blazing arrows, their ornaments of heated gold; they had
  been deployed by Rāvaṇa, yet they were destroyed by Rāma of unwearied deeds.
'4': >-
  Seeing and hearing of this, the night-roamers who survived—bewildered and
  shaken—came together; and the Rākṣasī-women too assembled, wretched and
  flooded with anxious thought.
'5': >-
  Widowed, their sons slain, their kinsmen struck down, the Rākṣasī-women
  gathered together; afflicted with sorrow, they wailed and lamented aloud.
'6': >-
  “How did aged Śūrpaṇakhā—hideous, gaunt-bellied, and of terrible
  visage—approach Rāma in the forest, he who was like the very form of Kandarpa
  (the god of love) in battle and beauty?
'7': >-
  Him—tender and delicate, of mighty spirit, ever engaged in the welfare of all
  beings—seeing him, she, a woman fit to be slain by the world, base in form,
  became inflamed with desire.
'8': >-
  How did that Rākṣasī, lacking in every virtue, of evil face, desire
  Rāma—virtuous, of great splendor and energy, and fair of countenance?
'9': >-
  By the scant good fortune of this people, she—wrinkled, white-haired—committed
  a deed improper, laughable, and condemned by all the worlds.
'10': >-
  For the destruction of the Rākṣasas, and of Dūṣaṇa and Khara, that misshapen
  one undertook the outrage against Rāghava.
'11': >-
  From that cause arose this great enmity made by Rāvaṇa; for the sake of his
  slaughter, Sītā was brought away by the ten-necked Rākṣasa.
'12': >-
  Yet the ten-necked one does not obtain Sītā, the daughter of Janaka; for by
  Rāghava a mighty enmity has been bound upon him—imperishable and unending.
'13': >-
  When that Rākṣasa Virādha sought Vaidehī, he was seen and then slain by Rāma
  alone; that itself is proof enough—an ample sign.
'14': >-
  Fourteen thousand Rākṣasas of dreadful deeds were slain in Janasthāna by
  arrows like tongues of flame.
'15': >-
  Khara too was slain in battle, and Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras likewise, by arrows
  radiant like the sun; that itself is proof enough—an ample sign.
'16': >-
  Yojanabāhu was slain, and Kabandha the eater of blood, roaring aloud in rage;
  that itself is proof enough—an ample sign.
'17': >-
  Rāma slew Vālin, the powerful son of the thousand-eyed Indra, Vālin who was
  like Meru in his greatness; that itself is proof enough—an ample sign.
'18': >-
  And Sugrīva, dwelling on Ṛṣyamūka, miserable and with his hopes shattered, was
  restored to kingship; that itself is proof enough—an ample sign.
'19': >-
  Vibhīṣaṇa spoke words endowed with dharma and purpose, beneficial to all the
  Rākṣasas, and sound in reason; yet through delusion they were not pleasing to
  him (Rāvaṇa).
'20': >-
  Had the younger brother of the Lord of Wealth (Vibhīṣaṇa) been heeded by the
  son of Pulastya (Rāvaṇa), then this Laṅkā would not become a cremation-ground,
  afflicted with grief.
'21': >-
  Hearing that mighty Kumbhakarṇa was slain by Rāghava, and that Atikāya, hard
  to endure, was then slain by Lakṣmaṇa—yet Rāvaṇa does not take heed, even
  though his dear son Indrajit has been struck down.
'22': >-
  “My son is slain, my brother is slain, my husband is slain in battle”—thus is
  the cry heard, in family after family, among the Rākṣasī-women.
'23': >-
  Here and there, by the thousands, chariots, horses, and elephants were slain;
  and in that battle, countless foot-soldiers too were slain by heroic Rāma.
'24': >-
  “Whether it be Rudra, or Viṣṇu, or the great Indra, the performer of a hundred
  sacrifices—or whether it be Yama himself—he slays us in the form of Rāma.”
'25': >-
  “Our foremost heroes have been slain by Rāma; we have no hope of life. Not
  seeing the end of fear, helpless, we lament.”
'26': >-
  “Daśagrīva, though a hero and a great boaster granted mighty boons, does not
  comprehend that this exceedingly dreadful fear has arisen from the hand of
  Rāma.”
'27': >-
  “Neither the gods, nor the Gandharvas, nor the Piśācas, nor the Rākṣasas are
  able, in battle, to rescue us when assailed by Rāma.”
'28': >-
  “And ominous portents are seen for Rāvaṇa, battle after battle; indeed they
  proclaim Rāvaṇa’s overthrow by Rāma.”
'29': >-
  “When Grandfather Brahmā was pleased—by gods, Dānavas, and
  Rākṣasas—fearlessness was granted to Rāvaṇa; it was not begged for with regard
  to human beings.”
'30': >-
  “Therefore, without doubt, this fear that has come upon us is, I think, from a
  human—terrible, life-ending, for the Rākṣasas and for Rāvaṇa.”
'31': >-
  Oppressed by that powerful Rākṣasa, strengthened by the gift of boons, the
  celestials, blazing with austerities, worshiped Grandfather Brahmā.
'32': >-
  For the welfare of the gods, the great-souled Grandfather Brahmā, pleased with
  the deities, spoke to them all this great utterance:
'33': >-
  “From this day forth, throughout the three worlds, all Dānavas and Rākṣasas
  shall everlastingly wander, forever set in fear.”
'34': >-
  Then all the deities, with Indra at their head, gathered together and
  propitiated the great God—he whose banner bears the bull, the slayer of
  Tripura.
'35': >-
  And gracious Mahādeva said these words to the gods: “For your benefit there
  shall arise a woman who brings about the destruction of the Rākṣasas.”
'36': >-
  “She—impelled by the gods—shall devour us all, just as hunger once consumed
  the Dānavas; a slayer of Rākṣasas, she shall destroy even those with Rāvaṇa.”
'37': >-
  “By the abduction committed by Rāvaṇa—ill-disciplined and evil-minded—this
  terrible calamity has come, and he is overwhelmed by grief.”
'38': >-
  “We do not see in the world anyone who might grant us refuge—when we are
  assailed by Rāghava, like (beings struck down) by Time itself at the end of an
  age.”
'39': >-
  “There is no refuge for us at all, as we stand amid this great fear—like
  female elephants in a forest, hemmed in by a wildfire.”
'40': >-
  “What has been done by that great-souled son of Pulastya has reached its
  appointed time; from the very quarter where the fear was seen, to that alone
  has he gone for refuge.”
'41': >-
  Thus indeed all the women of the night-roaming race, embracing one another
  with their arms, sank into despair, crushed by anguish and extreme terror; and
  then they cried aloud in a most dreadful wailing.
'42': >-
  Thus ends the ninety-fifth sarga, entitled “The Lamentation of the
  Rākṣasī-women,” in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, the
  primordial epic.
