  Now, in the holy, glorious Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa, begins the
  fifty-fourth canto, entitled “The Slaying of Vajradaṁṣṭra.”
'1': >-
  By the destruction of his own forces, and by the prowess of Aṅgada, the mighty
  rākṣasa Vajradaṁṣṭra—of great strength—was seized with wrath.
'2': >-
  Stretching his dreadful bow, blazing like Indra’s thunderbolt, he showered
  volleys of arrows upon the battalions of the vānaras.
'3': >-
  And those foremost rākṣasas too, stationed upon their chariots—heroes bearing
  weapons of many kinds—fought then in that battle.
'4': >-
  And all those heroic vānaras, bulls among monkeys, gathered on every side,
  fought with rocks in their hands.
'5': >-
  There, in that fierce field of combat, the rākṣasas then hurled down thousands
  of weapons against the chiefs among the monkeys.
'6': >-
  And the valiant vānaras, like rutting elephants, in turn hurled upon the
  rākṣasas mountains, trees, and great rocks.
'7': >-
  Of warriors fighting, unretreating in the battles, there arose a splendid
  combat between those hosts of rākṣasas and the others.
'8': >-
  Some lay with heads split open; some with feet and arms severed; their bodies
  mangled by weapons and drenched in blood.
'9': >-
  Monkeys and rākṣasas alike lay stretched upon the ground, while it became
  crowded with flocks of herons and vultures, and thronged with packs of
  jackals.
'10': >-
  And frightful trunks rose up—indeed terrifying to the timid—upon the earth:
  bodies with arms, hands, and heads cut off, and bodies cleft apart.
'11': >-
  Vānaras and rākṣasas also fell there upon the earth. Then, as the
  night-roaming foes were being struck down by the monkey army,
'12': >-
  all the force was shattered before Vajradaṁṣṭra’s very eyes—rākṣasas,
  fear-stricken, being slain by the vānaras.
'13': >-
  Seeing that, the powerful Vajradaṁṣṭra, his eyes reddened with rage, entered
  the fray with bow in hand, terrifying the monkey host.
'14': >-
  With arrows feathered with heron-plumes, straight-flying, he tore them apart;
  there he pierced and felled seven, eight, nine, and five vānaras.
'15': >-
  Vajradaṁṣṭra, exceedingly enraged and mighty, struck them again and again.
  Then all the troops of monkeys, their bodies cut by arrows, ran in fear toward
  Aṅgada, as creatures run toward Prajāpati.
'16': >-
  Then Vāli’s son, seeing the monkey hosts broken, looked upon that Vajradaṁṣṭra
  with wrath, even as he stood gazing out.
'17': >-
  Vajradaṁṣṭra and Aṅgada—both—fought each other hand to hand, moving about in
  extreme fury like two maddened elephants.
'18': >-
  Then, with a hundred thousand arrows, blazing like tongues of fire, he struck
  the mighty monkey prince in vital parts.
'19': >-
  Vāli’s son, of great strength, his whole body drenched in blood, of terrible
  prowess, hurled a tree at Vajradaṁṣṭra.
'20': >-
  Seeing that tree falling, the rākṣasa, unshaken, cut it into many pieces;
  shattered thus, it fell upon the ground.
'21': >-
  Seeing the prowess of Vajradaṁṣṭra, the bull among monkeys seized a massive
  rock, hurled it, and roared aloud.
'22': >-
  Seeing it rushing toward him, the valiant one leapt down from his chariot;
  unperturbed, club in hand, he stood upon the earth.
'23': >-
  The rock hurled by Aṅgada, reaching the crest of the battlefield, smashed then
  the chariot along with its wheel and pole and with its horses.
'24': >-
  Then the monkey, taking another huge mountain-peak adorned with trees, caused
  it to fall upon Vajradaṁṣṭra’s head.
'25': >-
  Vajradaṁṣṭra poured forth blood and fell into a deep swoon. For a moment he
  was bewildered, clutching his club and breathing hard.
'26': >-
  Regaining consciousness, the night-roamer, in supreme rage, struck Vāli’s
  son—who stood firm—with his club upon the region of the chest.
'27': >-
  Then, casting aside the club, they engaged there in a fight with fists; those
  two, monkey and rākṣasa, struck each other in turn.
'28': >-
  Both of them, vomiting blood and wearied by the blows, appeared as two bold
  combatants like the planets Aṅgāraka (Mars) and Budha (Mercury).
'29': >-
  Then Aṅgada, the bull among monkeys, of surpassing splendor, tore up a
  tree—standing there—laden with blossoms and fruits.
'30': >-
  And Vajradaṁṣṭra seized a splendid, broad sword and a bull-hide shield,
  covered with a net of little bells and fitted and prepared with leather.
'31': >-
  The monkey and the rākṣasa moved along wondrous and beautiful paths of combat,
  striking each other then, roaring, each desiring victory.
'32': >-
  Both, adorned with bloody wounds, shone like two blossoming kiṁśuka trees;
  fighting and greatly wearied, they sank to the earth upon their knees.
'33': >-
  In no more than the space of a blink, Aṅgada, elephant among monkeys, rose
  up—his eyes blazing—like a serpent struck with a stick.
'34': >-
  With a spotless, well-burnished sword, Vāli’s mighty son struck off the great
  head of Vajradaṁṣṭra.
'35': >-
  The auspicious head—its eyes still open—severed by the sword, fell in two,
  while the body was drenched in blood.
'36': >-
  Seeing Vajradaṁṣṭra slain, the rākṣasas, overcome by fear and bewilderment,
  fled in terror toward Laṅkā, being slain by the vānaras—downcast, wretched,
  their faces dejected, and from shame somewhat with faces lowered.
'37': >-
  Having slain that foe, that mighty Vāli’s son—like Indra the wielder of the
  thunderbolt—rejoiced in the midst of the monkey army, honored for his valor,
  as the thousand-eyed lord is surrounded by the gods.
'38': >-
  Thus ends the fifty-fourth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the venerable Vālmīki
  Rāmāyaṇa, the primordial epic, entitled “The Slaying of Vajradaṁṣṭra.”
