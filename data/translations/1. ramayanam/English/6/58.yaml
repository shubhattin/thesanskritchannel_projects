  Now begins the fifty-eighth canto in the Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the glorious
  Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, entitled “The Slaying of Prahasta.”
'1': >-
  Thereupon, seeing Prahasta coming forth, prepared for battle, Rāma—the subduer
  of foes—smilingly spoke to Vibhīṣaṇa.
'2': >-
  “Who is this one of exceedingly great body, surrounded by a vast force, who
  advances with mighty speed? What is his form, his strength, and his prowess?”
'3': >-
  Thus addressed by Rāghava, Vibhīṣaṇa replied: “O mighty-armed one, tell me
  (you ask me to tell you) about this valorous night-ranger.”
'4': >-
  “He is that king’s commander of the army, the rākṣasa named
  Prahasta—surrounded in Laṅkā by a third part of the rākṣasa-lord’s
  forces—valorous, expert in weapons, and renowned for celebrated might.”
'5': >-
  Then the terrible Prahasta, of dreadful prowess, coming forth—roaring, of
  colossal frame, encompassed by rākṣasas—
'6': >-
  was seen by the great host of the monkeys, mighty and strong, whose clamour
  had arisen, and who roared back at Prahasta.
'7': >-
  Swords, spears, lances, and tridents; arrows and iron clubs; maces and iron
  bars; javelins and many kinds of axes—
'8': >-
  and various bows of the victory-seeking rākṣasas—were lifted up and shone
  forth as they rushed upon the monkeys.
'9': >-
  And the monkey-warriors, eager to fight, seized flowering trees,
  mountain-peaks, and great long rocks as well.
'10': >-
  Meeting one another face to face, there arose a very great battle among them,
  with showers of many stones and showers of arrows pouring down.
'11': >-
  Many rākṣasas in the fight slew many foremost monkeys; and many monkeys in
  turn slew many rākṣasas.
'12': >-
  Some were crushed by tridents; some by supreme weapons; some struck by iron
  bars; and some severed by axes.
'13': >-
  Some, bereft of breath, fell upon the surface of the earth; some, their hearts
  rent asunder, were brought down by arrows well-aimed and duly fitted to the
  bow.
'14': >-
  Some were cut in two by swords and fell quivering upon the ground; monkeys
  were torn in the flanks by heroic rākṣasas.
'15': >-
  And rākṣasa hordes, on every side, were also crushed to the earth by enraged
  monkeys with trees and mountain-peaks.
'16': >-
  Smitten fiercely by hands whose palms were hard as the touch of a thunderbolt,
  and by clenched fists, they vomited blood from their mouths, their teeth and
  eyes shattered.
'17': >-
  There arose a tumultuous din—the cries of the afflicted, the shouts of those
  roaring like lions—of both monkeys and rākṣasas.
'18': >-
  The monkeys and rākṣasas, enraged and faithful to the path of heroes, with
  savage countenances performed fearless deeds.
'19': >-
  Narantaka, Kumbhahanu, Mahānāda, and Samunnata—these all, Prahasta’s
  counselors—slew the forest-dwellers (the monkeys).
'20': >-
  As they swiftly fell upon and struck down the monkeys, Dvivida smote Narāntaka
  with a mountain-peak.
'21': >-
  Then Durmukha, rising up again, taking a huge tree, struck down the rākṣasa
  named Kṣiprahasta, who stood uplifted (ready for attack).
'22': >-
  But Jāmbavān, exceedingly enraged, seized a massive rock, and the mighty one
  hurled it upon Mahānāda’s chest.
'23': >-
  Then Kumbhahanu there, valorous, encountered Tārā; and, struck at once with a
  great tree, he gave up his life in battle.
'24': >-
  Unable to endure that deed, Prahasta mounted his chariot; with bow in hand he
  wrought a fearful slaughter among the monkeys.
'25': >-
  Then, between the two armies, it seemed as though a whirlpool had arisen; and
  there was a sound like that of an immeasurable ocean, stirred and heaving.
'26': >-
  For that rākṣasa, maddened in battle, in great wrath, with a mighty multitude
  of arrows, tormented the monkeys in the supreme combat.
'27': >-
  The earth, strewn with the bodies of monkeys and rākṣasas, became exceedingly
  piled up, as though covered with dreadful mountains.
'28': >-
  That ground, hidden by a flood of blood, shone forth, like the month of
  Mādhava (spring) covered with blossoming palāśa trees.
'29': >-
  Abounding in heaps of slain heroes, with great trees of weapons broken, with a
  vast expanse of blood for water, it became as though a river flowing to the
  ocean of Yama (death).
'30': >-
  With liver and spleen as its great mud, with entrails scattered as its weeds,
  with fish of severed limbs and broken bodies and heads, with turf made of
  fragments of bodies—
'31': >-
  crowded with vultures, swans, and herons, frequented by kites and cranes,
  filled with foam of fat, and resounding like thunder with the groans of the
  distressed—
'32': >-
  that river of the battlefield, hard to cross for cowards—like a river in the
  rainy season, visited by swans and cranes—
'33': >-
  the rākṣasas and the foremost monkeys crossed that difficult river, as leaders
  of elephant-herds cross a lotus-pond whose pollen has been disturbed (and
  scattered).
'34': >-
  Then Nīla swiftly beheld Prahasta stationed in his chariot, sending forth
  torrents of arrows and striking down the monkeys.
'35': >-
  Like the wind in the sky forcefully scattering a great mass of clouds,
  Prahasta—the lord of the host—seeing Nīla charging in battle, (turned to meet
  him).
'36': >-
  With his chariot, radiant like the sun, he rushed straight at Nīla; and
  he—foremost among bowmen—drawing his bow in that supreme encounter, (prepared
  to strike).
'37': >-
  Prahasta, the commander of the host, loosed arrows at Nīla; and those shafts,
  reaching Nīla, pierced him deeply, well-directed.
'38': >-
  Those mighty swift arrows plunged into the earth like enraged serpents; and
  Nīla, struck by sharp arrows like blazing fire, (endured the assault).
'39': >-
  That mighty monkey, seeing Prahasta—most difficult to assail—rushing on, tore
  up a tree and struck him with it.
'40': >-
  Struck by that, the rākṣasa chief, enraged and roaring, rained down showers of
  arrows upon Nīla, the leader of the monkey-host.
'41': >-
  And Nīla, his eyes closed, could not ward off those very volleys of arrows
  from that wicked rākṣasa—just as a bull cannot avert a sudden autumnal shower
  of rain.
'42': >-
  In the same way, Nīla, with eyes shut, at once endured Prahasta’s
  difficult-to-withstand showers of arrows.
'43': >-
  Enraged by that rain of arrows, the mighty Nīla, with a great sāla tree,
  struck Prahasta’s horses.
'44': >-
  Then, his spirit overwhelmed by wrath, Nīla shattered the bow of that wicked
  one with speed, and roared again and again.
'45': >-
  Thus deprived of his bow, Prahasta, commander of the host, seized a dreadful
  iron club and leapt down from his chariot.
'46': >-
  Those two foremost leaders of armies, their enmity arisen, both full of force,
  stood with limbs drenched in blood, like two rutting elephants.
'47': >-
  Tearing at each other with exceedingly sharp tusks, they were like a lion and
  a tiger—acting with the movements of lions and tigers.
'48': >-
  Two heroic champions, bold in stride and victory, never turning back in
  battle, longing to gain fame—like Vṛtra and Vāsava (Indra).
'49': >-
  Then Prahasta, fully resolved, struck Nīla on the forehead with his club; and
  blood immediately flowed.
'50': >-
  Thereupon, his body smeared with blood, the great monkey seized a huge tree
  and, in wrath, hurled it upon Prahasta’s chest.
'51': >-
  Taking up his great club, he (Prahasta), of inconceivable blows, charged with
  force upon the powerful monkey Nīla.
'52': >-
  Seeing that furious one of terrible speed rushing upon him, the great monkey
  then seized a great rock with mighty swiftness.
'53': >-
  In the combat, Nīla swiftly dropped that rock upon the head of Prahasta, who
  desired battle and fought with the club.
'54': >-
  Released by Nīla, the foremost of monkeys, that massive, dreadful rock
  shattered Prahasta’s head into many pieces.
'55': >-
  Deprived of life, his splendor gone, his strength and senses departed, he
  suddenly fell to the earth like a tree cut at the root.
'56': >-
  From his head thus split open, blood flowed in great measure; from his body
  too it streamed, like a cascade from a mountain.
'57': >-
  When Prahasta, unshakable and mighty, had been slain by Nīla, the
  rākṣasas—exceedingly dejected—returned to Laṅkā.
'58': >-
  When their commander of the host was slain, they could not stand their
  ground—like broken water (a disrupted current) reaching the bund of a bridge
  (and failing to hold together).
'59': >-
  That chief of the army having been slain, those rākṣasas, their efforts gone,
  went to the house of the lord of rākṣasas (Rāvaṇa) and became silent in
  brooding, as though struck dumb.
'60': They were plunged into a fierce ocean of grief, and became as if senseless.
'61': >-
  Then Nīla, victorious and of great might, praised for his well-accomplished
  deed, met with Rāma together with Lakṣmaṇa; and the troop-leader appeared with
  a delighted countenance.
'62': >-
  Thus ends, in the venerable, glorious Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki—the Ādikāvya—in the
  Yuddha-kāṇḍa, the fifty-eighth canto, entitled “The Slaying of Prahasta.”
